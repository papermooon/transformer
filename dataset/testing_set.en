In the United States, AIDS activists took to the streets, even shutting down the Food and Drug Administration’s headquarters for a day in October 1988.
Globally, activists lobbied governments and pharmaceutical companies to make medicines more affordable.
This activism continues, and should serve as a model for action on NCDs.
Next, the NCD community must adopt a bolder approach to budgets – the “B” of the AIDS movement’s strategy.
Civic organizing and grassroots activism may fuel early energies, but organizing and sustaining a broad-based coalition takes money.
The AIDS movement was clear about this from the beginning, and lobbied for resources to support its advocacy and accountability effectively.
“C” is for coalitions: the AIDS movement was quick to understand that progress would come only with diverse support.
Activists established links between people living with HIV and those with other concerns, such as women’s rights, intellectual property, nutrition, and housing.
Issue-specific coalitions and campaigns work best when they bring together government insiders and outsiders, to combine perspectives and expertise.
The AIDS movement also understood that a holistic response to the epidemic was essential.
Thus, “D,” the underlying determinants of health, was to draw attention to the interconnectivity of the drivers of challenge.
For example, lobbying education leaders to keep girls in school longer has contributed to providing young people with the knowledge and agency to make smart decisions about when and with whom to negotiate safe sex.
Similarly, links were forged between groups working on poverty, gender, and nutrition – factors that played a role in driving the AIDS crisis.
NCDs are no less isolated in their causality, and similarly require a multi-sector approach to prevention.
Engagement – “E” – was what helped the AIDS movement become so influential.
By borrowing from the playbook of the disability rights movement, which championed the mantra “Nothing About Us Without Us,” AIDS advocates demanded representation on the bodies established to address the disease.
For example, UNAIDS remains the only United Nations agency with seats on its board for representatives from civil society.
This norm is so powerfully embedded in the AIDS movement that it would be almost unthinkable for an AIDS meeting to take place without representation from the community.
Disease prevention movements must also develop persuasive narratives, and “F” – framing the issue – was essential to the AIDS community’s effort to gain support from political leaders.
In particular, access to AIDS treatment was framed as a matter of economic justice.
Framing the narrative this way led to a dramatic reduction in the price of medicines, so much so that more than half of people living with HIV in low- and middle-income countries are in treatment.
An equally important framing issue for AIDS, which is highly relevant to the NCDs movement, is that of responsibility.
The AIDS community worked hard to shift the focus from blaming individuals’ lifestyle choices to putting the onus on the state for providing health care and removing legal discrimination.
In the AIDS debate, gender – our movement’s “G” – was a significant focal point.
HIV was initially seen as a “gay disease,” and gender identity was embedded in the DNA of the AIDS movement early on.
Gender dimensions of NCDs are no less important; one only has to consider how alcohol and tobacco are marketed to understand that.
Gender, therefore, must become a focus of NCDs prevention efforts.
Finally, “H” – human rights – was the bedrock of the AIDS response.
Campaigns were launched against discrimination in workplaces, schools, and health centers.
Strategic litigation helped ensure equality under the law.
The AIDS movement refused to hold major conferences in countries with punitive laws against people living with HIV.
The NCD movement could take a similar tack by, for example, refusing to meet in countries that fail to restrict advertising of junk food to children.
The list of AIDS lessons could continue throughout the alphabet, but ending with “H” is apt, given that human rights drove the response, and should drive the response to NCDs.
Poverty, exclusion, and social and economic marginalization put people at higher risk for HIV.
It is no different for NCDs.
The early mainstream reaction to the AIDS epidemic was to ask, “Why don’t those people make better choices?”
The AIDS movement made clear that that was the wrong question.
Today, with 70% of the planet at risk of premature death from preventable illnesses, “those people” are many of us.
The NCD and AIDS communities can learn from one another.
We are a stronger movement when we join forces.
The views expressed here do not necessarily reflect those of UNAIDS.
Toward a More Reflective Planet
CAMBRIDGE – The last time the atmosphere held as much carbon dioxide as it does today was about three million years ago – a time when sea levels were 10-30 meters higher than they are now.
Climate models have long struggled to duplicate those large fluctuations in sea levels – until now.
Indeed, for the first time, a high-quality model of Antarctic ice and climate has been able to simulate these large swings.
That is smart science, but it brings devastating news.
The new model shows that melting in Antarctica alone could increase global sea levels by as much as one meter (3.2 feet) by the end of this century – well above prior estimates.
Worse, it suggests that even extraordinary success at cutting emissions would not save the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, locking in eventual sea-level increases of more than five meters.
As little as one meter could put at risk entire cities, from Miami to Mumbai, and cause enormous economic disruption.
We need to turn down the heat – and fast.
To this end, albedo modification – a kind of geoengineering intended to cool the planet by increasing the reflectivity of the earth’s atmosphere – holds tremendous promise.
Injecting synthetic aerosols that reflect sunlight into the stratosphere, for example, could help counter the warming caused by greenhouse gases.
The mechanism is similar to wearing a white shirt in the summer: white reflects sunlight and cools what is underneath, whereas darker colors absorb sunlight and heat.
To be sure, even in the best-case scenario, solar geoengineering alone could not stabilize the world’s climate.
For that, we must both stop pumping carbon pollution into the atmosphere and learn how to remove what is already there.
That is why emissions cuts should receive the lion’s share of resources devoted to combating climate change.
But, as the recent study shows, emissions cuts alone cannot save the West Antarctic Ice Sheet and prevent a drastic sea-level rise.
If they are pursued in conjunction with moderate albedo modification, however, there is a chance of halting rising temperatures, helping to keep the world under 1.5° Celsius above pre-industrial levels, the more ambitious target agreed at the Paris climate talks last December.
(It should be noted that, given carbon-cycle feedbacks, such as the thawing of permafrost, there is a chance that the world would face a 1.5°C rise, even if emissions were eliminated today.)
Most of the world’s state-of-the-art climate models have explored albedo modification, and each of them has found that the process does have the potential to mitigate climate change.
Beyond limiting total warming, it can help to check the rise in peak temperatures, decreasing the risk of destructive heat waves.
And it seems to be particularly effective at reducing extreme rainfall, which holds profound implications for minimizing flood damage.
Albedo modification remains uncertain and risky, owing partly to a dearth of organized research into the subject.
And, in fact, albedo modification would undoubtedly make some things worse.
But there is not a single climate model run that shows that a moderate intervention would make any region worse off overall.
Moreover, the large potential upside, measured in trillions of dollars, contrasts with low direct costs – in the single-digit billions for full-scale deployment.
In fact, albedo modification is so cheap that direct costs will not be the deciding issue.
Instead, it is a risk-risk trade-off – one that will require more research to assess.
Given the lack of knowledge, no sensible person would push for deploying albedo modification today.
But it would make no sense to ignore its potential.
After all, no one would argue that we should abandon research on a promising cancer drug because it is unproven.
The US National Academy of Sciences first called attention to what it then described as “climate modification” in a 1983 report.
It recommended careful research in 1992 and again in 2015.
Major environmental groups such as the Environmental Defense Fund and the Natural Resources Defense Council support careful, small-scale research.
Yet no such program exists.
One reason for this is concern about the diversion of resources from other approaches.
And, of course, there are tradeoffs.
But the US, for example, has an annual climate science budget of around $3 billion.
An exploratory solar geoengineering program, costing only a few tens of millions of dollars per year, is entirely feasible.
A larger obstacle to progress is fear that more attention to geoengineering solutions would sap motivation to cut emissions.
Maybe so, but it would be barking mad to take up smoking simply because an experimental cancer treatment showed some promise on a lab rat.
And, in fact, it is conceivable that a concerted effort to advance research on albedo modification could spur action to cut emissions, much like a graphic look at the side effects of chemotherapy prompts some to stop smoking.
Whichever reaction prevails, the moral imperative to explore a technology that can protect the poorest and most vulnerable this century would seem to trump amorphous concerns that doing so could weaken the incentive to pursue solutions that would largely benefit future generations.
China has initiated a limited research program on albedo modification.
The US has not.
Given that albedo modification is the kind of technology that necessitates an open, transparent, and international research effort – precisely the kind of effort in which the US excels – this is a serious failing.
The US government should take the lead now in researching albedo modification.
Even if the result was that albedo modification does not work, the dividends of such research would be enormous, owing to the added pressure to cut emissions.
And if it turned out to be successful, the social, environmental, and economic returns would be tremendous.
The US Is Exporting Obesity
CAMBRIDGE – As US President Donald Trump’s administration throws sharp elbows in trade negotiations and systematically rescinds regulations introduced by President Barack Obama, one casualty is likely to be efforts to fight the global obesity epidemic.
Left unchecked, rapidly rising obesity rates could slow or even reverse the dramatic gains in health and life expectancy that much of the world has enjoyed over the past few decades.
And by forcing its food culture on countries like Mexico and Canada, the United States is making the problem worse.
One of the paradoxes of modern global capitalism is that whereas more than 800 million people in the world do not have enough to eat, an estimated 700 million people (including 100 million children) are obese.
Of course, the two are not necessarily directly related. A considerable proportion of world hunger occurs in countries suffering from domestic strife or severe government dysfunction.
The obesity epidemic, however, has a much broader footprint, affecting advanced economies and most emerging markets.
Although there is some connection between obesity and poverty within countries, it is notable that obesity rates in rich countries such as the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada are among the world’s highest.
Recently, the US Centers for Disease Control estimated that a stunning 40% of all Americans are obese (defined as having a body mass index of 30 or higher), a figure that includes 20.6% of adolescents (12-19 years old).
According to the CDC, the average weight of an American woman today is greater than the average weight of an American man in 1960 (166 pounds, or 75 kilos).
Back in 1960, the average weight of an American woman was 140 pounds, while the average weight of an American man today is 195 pounds.
(Over the same period, the average height of Americans increased by only one inch, or 2.5 centimeters.)
This same dynamic is playing out worldwide, with obesity rates soaring in Europe, Latin America, and even in China.
Although it is difficult to gauge the long-run health consequences, there is abundant evidence that obesity contributes significantly to higher rates of type II diabetes, heart attacks, and certain types of cancer.
The health costs are staggering, estimated to be close to $200 billion per year in the US alone.
And with rising childhood obesity rates worldwide portending significantly greater health problems in the future adult population, the costs are likely to rise considerably.
The causes of obesity are manifold and complex.
Nevertheless, a growing body of evidence suggests that a culture emphasizing processed food and a generally sedentary lifestyle lies at the center of the problem.
In emerging markets, rapid urbanization is another important factor, as well as a desire to emulate Western lifestyles.
Many governments have launched initiatives to improve nutrition education.
Unfortunately, industry advertising typically dwarfs these efforts, as do US trade lobbyists’ own efforts to push processed and fast food on the rest of the world.
It is hard to ignore the fact that Mexico’s adult obesity rate has soared since the adoption in 1993 of the North American Free Trade Agreement.
While there are many causes, post-NAFTA direct foreign investment in the processed food industry and a surge in advertising are important contributors.
Mexican consumption of sugary beverages nearly tripled between 1993 and 2014, and a new tax on sugary drinks has muted demand only slightly since then.
The other NAFTA partner, Canada, has similarly experienced a rise in obesity, partly because US imports have led to a sharp decline in the price of fructose.
It is unfortunate that government regulators have been so slow to try to reverse these trends by, for example, helping to educate the public on the science of nutrition.
And, for too long, most government anti-obesity education has focused on mechanically regulating calorie intake, without taking into account that different foods have dramatically different effects on appetite (as David Ludwig, a professor at Harvard Medical School, emphasizes in his excellent new book Always Hungry).
Skeptics may point out that nutrition guidelines always seem to be morphing, with last year’s sin food becoming this year’s superfood, and vice versa.
Though there is some truth to this, the fact is that nutrition research has made significant progress in recent decades.
The government has other tools at its disposal, besides education, for affecting people’s eating habits.
They can and should place greater restrictions on advertising to children, as the UK, France, and several other countries have done; obesity in early years can lead to lifelong problems.
Beyond that, Ludwig, Tufts University’s Dariush Mozaffarian, and I have proposed instituting a tax on processed food, much the same way that tobacco is taxed.
Proceeds from the tax could be used to subsidize healthier alternatives.
It is perhaps fantasy to expect the current US administration to consider any kind of anti-obesity strategy while it is still busy dismantling Obama-era policies.
But that is all the more reason why countries entering new trade agreements with the US (for example, the post-Brexit UK, or post-NAFTA Canada) must be wary of any provisions that tie their hands in the war against obesity.
Obamacare and Effective Government
BERKELEY – When historians look back on the United States’ Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), President Barack Obama’s controversial 2010 health-care reform, we predict that they will not devote much attention to its regulations, its troubled insurance exchanges, or its website’s flawed launch.
Instead, we think that they will focus on how “Obamacare” encouraged a wave of innovation that gradually tamed the spiraling costs of a dysfunctional system, even as millions of previously excluded Americans gained access to health insurance.
Innovation is probably the least discussed aspect of health-care reform.
Yet it is crucial to “bending” the sector’s cost curve, because it enables the delivery of quality health care in cost-effective ways.
Obamacare has provided powerful new incentives for such innovation.
From 1980 to 2010, US health-care spending grew almost twice as fast as the economy, rising from 9.2% to 17.4% of GDP.
While many factors contributed to this surge, most experts agree that the single most important cause was a fee-for-service system that rewarded health-care providers for billing as many services as possible, rather than for keeping people healthy and treating their illnesses efficiently.
The ACA has been changing that, by establishing myriad new incentives to foster efficiency in health-care delivery – for example, by reducing costly and unnecessary hospital infections and readmissions, and by adopting electronic health records.
Most important, the ACA is providing incentives for the creation of “affordable care organizations,” “bundled payment systems,” and other delivery innovations to encourage better coordination of care, especially for patients with numerous chronic conditions.
Such patients are among the 10% who account for an estimated 64% of overall health care costs.
Around the US, providers, insurers, non-profits, and local governments are responding to the ACA’s incentives.
The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (which provide health insurance to pensioners and the poor) has just announced its second round of grants – $665 million to 28 states, three territories, and the District of Columbia – to encourage innovations in health-care delivery.
Of course, it is still too early to declare victory, but Obamacare seems to be working.
According to a recent analysis by the Council of Economic Advisers (CEA), about ten million people gained health insurance coverage in 2014 as a result of the ACA – the largest increase in coverage in four decades.
But the real surprise is that growth in health-care spending slowed dramatically from 2010 to 2013, to roughly the same pace as GDP growth.
This represented a sharp break from the previous half-century; indeed, this period was characterized by the slowest growth in real per capita health-care spending on record.
To be sure, the ACA is only one factor in this promising trend; growth in health-care spending often slows in the wake of an economic downturn.
But Medicare spending, which is not affected by recessions, has slowed along with private health-care spending.
In a recent study, the CEA concluded that the ACA’s Medicare reforms account for a significant share of the slowdown.
The ACA is an example of how government can promote innovation to address major societal challenges by providing goals, directions, and incentives, rather than dictating solutions.
The government plays a role akin to that of a venture capitalist providing seed money and financial support to foster innovation.
In this scenario, different players – Medicare and Medicaid, state and local governments, private insurers, physicians, and social entrepreneurs – collaborate to hammer out effective solutions that can be scaled with government revenues.
For example, responding to the ACA’s incentives and flexibility, Arkansas and Oregon have launched bold experiments to revamp Medicaid, in part by rewarding health-care providers who deliver better outcomes and keep patients healthier.
In Camden, New Jersey, Jeffrey Brenner, a family doctor, has pioneered strategies to reduce hospital stays by “super-utilizers,” a small share of Medicaid patients who are frequently admitted for expensive acute care.
Brenner mapped “hot spots” around Camden, and sought to find out why people in some areas ran up such huge bills.
The problem was not fraud. It was an absence of coordinated medical care, especially basic primary care, and a lack of attention to people’s underlying risk factors.
The most expensive 1% of patients, those with a tangle of issues, accounted for 30% of Camden’s public health-care spending.
Brenner’s Camden Coalition of Healthcare Providers, founded in 2003, received its first funding from a philanthropy, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, and a private insurer, United Health Care.
The remarkable success in Camden has prompted the foundation to fund similar experiments in Boston, Cleveland, Cincinnati, western Michigan, and Humboldt County, California.
Now the government is providing additional support, with grants to similar programs in Maryland, Colorado, Pennsylvania, and North Carolina.
Oregon has entered into a pay-for-success bargain with the federal government.
The state will receive $1.9 billion over five years to revamp its Medicaid services along the lines of Camden’s approach.
Oregon will get the money only if its per-person Medicaid costs climb substantially more slowly than other states’.
At the moment, Oregon is on track.
Arkansas has moved 20 different “episodes” of health-care delivery (including hip and knee replacements, pregnancy, colonoscopies, asthma, and congestive heart failure) from fee-for-service to paying for quality outcomes.
The results so far are promising – not just by reining in costs, but also by better aligning service delivery with best practices.
The government can spur innovation by offering incentives that tap many different players’ strengths.
In health care, that means taking advantage of the purchasing clout of Medicare and Medicaid, the risk-taking of social entrepreneurs and philanthropists, and the dynamism of markets and private business.
And health-care reform is just one example in which government can deliver what the public wants by setting goals, encouraging creativity, and providing the resources to scale up what works.
Twenty-five years from now, we hope that historians look back on the ACA as the start of a new era of public-private collaboration to develop innovative solutions to complex social problems – and thus to restore trust in government itself.
An Unhinged Democracy in America
NEW YORK – Alexis de Tocqueville, a liberal French aristocrat, visited the United States in 1831 ostensibly to write a study of its “enlightened” prison system (locking people up in solitary confinement like penitent monks was the latest modern idea).
Out of this trip came de Tocqueville’s masterpiece, Democracy in America, in which he expressed admiration for American civil liberties and compared the world’s first genuine liberal democracy favorably with Old World institutions.
But de Tocqueville had serious reservations, too.
The biggest danger to US democracy, he believed, was the tyranny of the majority, the suffocating intellectual conformity of American life, the stifling of minority opinion and dissent.
He was convinced that any exercise of unlimited power, be it by an individual despot or a political majority, is bound to end in disaster.
Democracy, in the sense of majority rule, needs restraints, just like any other system of government.
That is why the British have mixed the authority of elected politicians with that of aristocratic privilege.
And it is why Americans still cherish their Constitution’s separation of governmental powers.
By contrast, in the French republican system, the state represents the so-called will of the people.
As a result, its authority is less constrained, which may explain the greater frequency in France of street demonstrations and even of mob violence.
Indeed, these upheavals may act as informal checks on official power.
De Tocqueville identified another source of restraint in the US system: the power of religion.
Human greed, as well as the temptation of going to extremes, was tempered by the moderating influence of a shared Christian faith.
Liberty, in the US, was inextricably entwined with religious belief.
The spectacle of American politics today would seem to cast doubt on de Tocqueville’s observation.
Or, rather, the rhetoric of many Republicans aspiring to be President sounds like a perversion of what he saw in 1831.
Religion and liberty are still mentioned in one breath, but often to promote extreme views.
Religious minorities are denounced.
Apocalyptic fears are stoked.
Intolerance is promoted.
All in the name of God.
Of course, the US is not the only country where fringe demagogues are now poisoning mainstream politics.
Religious language is less often heard in Western Europe, but all the more in parts of Eastern Europe, Turkey, and Israel.
And the message of populism is similar everywhere in the democratic world: Liberal elites are to be blamed for all our ills and anxieties, from Europe’s refugee crisis to the inequities of the global economy, from “multiculturalism” to the rise of radical Islam.
Populism is causing considerable alarm, not least because mainstream politicians seem less and less capable of finding a convincing way to stop its rise.
Those who are rightly worried about the politics of fear like to assume that populism is a threat to democracy itself.
Distrust of the elites fosters distrust of the system, and the longing for great leaders who will deliver us from the selfishness of professional politicians will lead to new forms of tyranny.
That may turn out to be true.
But, in fact, it is not really democracy that is presently under siege.
In some ways, many societies are more democratic than they were before.
If nothing else, the Donald Trump phenomenon shows that old party establishments can be skirted by popular outsiders.
Social media also make it possible to bypass the traditional filters of authority, such as serious newspapers or broadcasters, and publish any point of view directly.
The power of private fortunes to sway public opinion, especially in the US, also upsets the traditional order.
Anti-elitism can be fanned by vast individual wealth, because elitism is defined less by financial clout than by education.
Angry people swayed by the populist message are angrier at liberal professors, clever bankers, or skeptical journalists than they are at multi-billionaires.
(It is both President Barack Obama’s elite education and the color of his skin – or, rather, the combination of the two – that has attracted so much rage.)
At the same time, people have more power to elect power-hungry crooks than they did before.
Like the wild and woolly views swirling around the Internet, such figures are no longer kept at bay by traditional party elites.
What is steadily falling away is not democracy, but the restraints that de Tocqueville thought were essential to make liberal politics work.
More and more, populist leaders regard their election by the majority of voters as a license to crush all political and cultural dissent.
De Tocqueville’s nightmare is not yet the reality in the US, but it is close to what we see in Russia, Turkey, Hungary, and perhaps Poland.
Even Israel, which, despite its many obvious problems, has always had a robust democracy, is moving in this direction, with government ministers demanding proof of “state loyalty” from writers, artists, and journalists.
It is hard to see how traditional elites are going to regain any authority.
And yet I think de Tocqueville was right.
Without editors, there can be no serious journalism.
Without parties led by experienced politicians, the borders between show business and politics will disappear.
Without limits placed on the appetites and prejudices of the majority, intolerance will rule.
This is not a question of nostalgia or snobbery.
Nor is it a plea to trust anyone with a plausible air of authority.
Anger at the elites is not always unjust.
Globalization, immigration, and cosmopolitanism have served the interests of a highly educated minority, but sometimes at the expense of less privileged people.
And yet, the problem identified by de Tocqueville in the 1830s is more relevant now than ever.
Liberal democracy cannot be reduced to a popularity contest.
Constraints on majority rule are necessary to protect the rights of minorities, be they ethnic, religious, or intellectual.
When that protection disappears, we will all end up losing the freedoms that democracy was supposed to defend.
An American Political Tragedy
BERLIN – US President Donald Trump’s nearly eight months in office have been characterized by a series of disturbing political developments.
But Trump is not entirely to blame.
His presidency is just the latest act in a long-running political tragedy.
From a foreign-policy perspective, the problem began in the 1990s, when the United States squandered the post-Cold War peace dividend.
With regard to domestic policy, the failures began even earlier: from Reaganomics in the 1980s to Obamacare in the 2010s, major policies have often overpromised and underperformed, while failing to address underlying problems.
Of course, US politicians are rarely short on lofty rhetoric – from Ronald Reagan’s “Morning in America” campaign to Barack Obama’s “Yes, we can” slogan to Donald Trump’s “America First” refrain.
And, beginning with John F. Kennedy, presidents have likened the US to a “city upon a hill” – an example to the rest of the world.
Yet it is hard to remember the last time the US produced a policy that could serve as a model for others to emulate.
The country has not had a pro-active, forward-looking government since the 1960s.
Since the 1990s, it has not invested sufficiently in human capital to meet the fast-changing economy’s shifting skill requirements; undertaken no effective education, environmental, or labor-market reforms; and launched no new urban initiatives or future-proofing infrastructure policies.
The list goes on.
The reason is simple: Americans’ longstanding suspicion of “big government” morphed into a kind of political self-hatred, with policymakers and citizens alike led to believe that government is at its best when it does not govern.
And, as the US government has retreated from society, the US has retreated from the rest of the world.
These trends have culminated in Trump, whose most popular policies focus on destruction, rather than creation.
Deregulation will supposedly slay the “deep state” chimera, while enabling the US to achieve energy independence.
A US-centered foreign policy focused not on reshaping America’s role in the world, but on reducing it.
From the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) to the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) policy, Trump likes to reverse past policies, without devising anything to replace them.
American conservatives have so far failed to read Trump’s intentions accurately.
In July, Robert W. Merry wrote that Trump had “yet to score anything approaching a serious legislative victory – or to demonstrate any serious political momentum.”
But the truth is that Trump’s agenda has plenty of momentum; it is just focused on demolishing Obama’s legacy.
As the international law expert Richard Falk has argued, it is Trump’s “demagoguery” that enables this approach, as it “blinds adherents to their true material self-interests and misidentifies their real social enemies.”
Trump’s rejection of “reasoned discourse, including commitments to truth and evidence,” has been accompanied by an unlimited “capacity to manipulate mass opinion and play on such repressed emotions as racism and class envy.”
The result of Trump’s approach is that America’s existing problems are worsening and huge opportunities are being missed.
But what can stop demons already unleashed?
And, even if they are stopped, can the damage they have already wrought be reversed?
There was some backlash against Trump when he failed to condemn clearly the white supremacist demonstrators in Charlottesville, Virginia, whose “Unite the Right” rally in August ended with the murder of a counter-protester.
But it has done little to weaken Trump’s destructive momentum: just a few weeks later, Trump announced his plan to end DACA, a policy that protected from deportation some 800,000 young immigrants who were brought to the US as children.
Beyond lamenting the astonishing depths to which a great political culture and system can fall, what can be done?
One obvious option, which Democrats largely seem to be taking, is to reject Trump and everything his administration stands for.
But that risks ensuring the persistence of the dysfunctional dynamics that brought the US to this point.
Another option, however unappealing at first glance, is to accept the Trump administration.
The result of such a choice may well be the worsening of domestic problems and the weakening of checks and balances.
But it is also possible that checks and balances will hold until the next election, enabling America’s existing political parties to rebuild and new parties to emerge.
The result, one hopes, would be a much-needed political realignment – indeed, a political renaissance.
To be sure, such a shift would take time – time that, depending on how long Trump remains in office, parties may not have.
Republicans may be politically handicapped for years, as they are forced to reckon with the Faustian bargain they struck for the sake of political power.
Democrats, for their part, face a broad leadership vacuum and a lack of political vision, owing to their now-internalized fear of being labeled “big spenders.”
And, as it stands, no third parties or candidates provide reasonable alternatives.
Nonetheless, there are encouraging signs that some Republicans and Democrats are thinking outside the party box.
More must follow suit, recognizing that realigning the existing party system may be the only way to break the stalemate of US politics and, potentially, reverse decades of dangerous democratic underperformance.
The next act in America’s political drama, following the 2018 congressional midterm election, could be marked by a kind of reckoning, with the 2020 presidential campaign accompanied by civic breakdown and the escalation of violent confrontation that has lingered beneath the surface for years.
To rewrite the plot before that scenario plays out requires reshuffling and revitalizing US politics, so that, in the words of the poet Seamus Heaney, “hope and history rhyme” once again in America.
Tracking Big Pharma’s Progress on AMR
LONDON – This week, at the World Economic Forum’s annual meeting in Davos, the Access to Medicine Foundation (AMF) is launching an antimicrobial resistance (AMR) benchmark to “track how pharmaceutical companies are responding to the increase in drug-resistance.”
The benchmark builds on recommendations made in the May 2016 final report of the British government’s Review on Antimicrobial Resistance, which I chaired, and on the important work being done by Chatham House, Drive-AB, the Global Union for Antibiotic Research and Development, the Pew Trusts, and the World Health Organization.
For the past ten years, the AMF, which is independent of the pharmaceutical industry, has published a highly regarded Access to Medicine Index, making it uniquely suited to quantify how various companies measure up in the fight against AMR.
In my view, the new benchmark will have many benefits, not least for equity analysts who might consider adjusting their stock recommendations on the basis of the AMF’s findings.
During our Review, I learned that many in the investment community were not interested in pharmaceutical companies’ behavior on this issue, because there were no readily available data by which to make comparisons.
Well, now there are.
As I have written previously, the Review issued Ten Commandments for confronting the AMR threat.
While the AMF’s benchmark isn’t designed to address all ten, it does touch on the areas that are most relevant to the health-care industry.
Two areas that would benefit from their own quantifiable benchmarks are diagnostics, to prevent antibiotics from being prescribed unnecessarily, and agriculture, where antibiotics are used excessively to promote livestock growth.
Ultimately, microbes will build a resistance to any new drugs that we create, so we also need to seek ways to reduce overall demand for antibiotics.
For its part, the AFM will calculate its benchmark separately for the eight major pharmaceutical companies that currently appear to be working on replacement drugs, generic producers, and firms focused solely on research and development.
The fact that only eight “Big Pharma” firms are even attempting to develop new antibiotics and vaccines is a cause for serious concern.
As the Review concluded, failure to create effective new drugs could result in ten million people dying from AMR-related diseases every year by 2050, at a cost of some $100 trillion.
One of the more radical ideas we discussed during the Review concerned financial “pull” incentives to reward firms that successfully develop new drugs.
We determined that an effective market-entry reward could be funded by small levies on the sales of the other top-50 pharmaceutical firms that are not carrying their weight.
The new benchmark’s overall score for a firm can be broken down into three separate categories: its commitment to research and development for new drugs; its manufacturing, production, and environmental standards; and its marketing and distribution practices, which should focus on ensuring access rather than excess.
Of the eight Big Pharma firms that are included, the British company GlaxoSmithKline currently scores the highest.
For those of us who conducted the Review, this is no surprise.
Frankly, we would not classify all eight firms as being truly committed to the cause, but at least with the benchmark, they can now see clearly how they can improve.
Moreover, one hopes the benchmark will prod into action all of the firms that have not even bothered to join the fight against AMR.
It is worth remembering that at the World Economic Forum’s annual meeting in January 2016, more than 80 companies signed a declaration promising to work toward solutions.
And yet more than 70 of those firms do not appear on the AMF’s new index.
Talk is cheap; these companies need to put their money where their mouth is.
As for generic producers, the AMF’s scoring of pollution could prove most important, given that many of these companies operate in developing countries where environmental degradation is a major concern.
Policymakers and business leaders in these countries will want to pay attention to how their generic drug producers score, so that they can make improvements.
The benchmark’s third category concerns biotech firms, which conduct research into drugs that can combat the “priority pathogens” identified by the WHO.
This category will be particularly helpful for financial analysts, or even for venture capitalists, given that specific advances could earn a future market-entry reward or have vast commercial potential.
And, of course, the new scoring will also be important to the companies themselves, and for policymakers who are trying to strike a balance between “pull” incentives and current priority-drug needs.
It would be great to see similar benchmarks for the major food producers and makers of diagnostics.
Indeed, I have long believed that diagnostics could be the single biggest game changer in the fight against AMR.
But for now, let us hope the pharmaceutical benchmark gets the attention it deserves.
How to Fight Antimicrobial Resistance
ZURICH – Two weeks ago, G20 leaders committed to working together to address one of the world’s most pressing and perplexing security threats: antimicrobial resistance (AMR) – a fierce and evolving adversary against which conventional therapeutic weapons are of no use.
The threat is straightforward: bacteria and other microbes are becoming resistant to available medicines faster than new medicines are being developed.
Every year, drug-resistant microbes kill about 700,000 people worldwide – more than three times the annual death toll from armed conflicts.
In 2016, a special panel commissioned by the British government predicted that, by 2050, as many as ten million more people will die from drug-resistant microbes every year.
AMR now poses a clear and present danger to every person on the planet.
Unless we confront it head-on, we could return to a world in which it is common for people to die from basic infections.
Beyond the cost in human lives, AMR could devastate the world’s economies.
In Europe alone, the annual health-care costs and productivity losses associated with AMR already total an estimated €1.5 billion ($1.7 billion).
The G20, for its part, has taken an important step forward.
Each G20 country has promised to start implementing national plans to fight AMR in earnest, and to do more to promote new treatments against resistant microbes.
To that end, G20 leaders are calling for an international “R&D Collaboration Hub” to “maximize the impact of existing and new anti-microbial basic and clinical research initiatives.”
And they have promised to explore how market incentives can be used to encourage new research.
Beyond the G20, innovative public-private partnerships are emerging to deliver new treatments against drug-resistant killers such as tuberculosis.
And some governments have already started filling critical roles in the global response to AMR, by collecting data on the spread of resistant strains of E. coli, salmonella, and other common pathogens.
Now it is up to political leaders to follow through on their commitments.
Because new treatments for multidrug-resistant microbes aren’t expected to generate much return on investment, it is incumbent upon governments to make research and development in this field more attractive to private companies, and, in order to stem the development of resistance, to ensure that new drugs are not overused.
When traditional market mechanisms fail, instruments such as “transferable market exclusivities” can help, by allowing drug makers to transfer an antimicrobial medicine’s intellectual-property benefits to another drug.
In addition to policy innovations, more well-funded collaborations between governments and private institutions are needed.
When private institutions enter into such collaborative efforts, they must be prepared to work outside of traditional boundaries, accept the challenges associated with complex public projects, and be willing to bring their skills, ideas, and experience to the table.
In responding to AMR, we can learn some valuable lessons from other global public-health efforts.
Malaria, which is caused by a parasite transmitted by more than 100 species of Anopheles mosquito, is a leading cause of death in many parts of the world.
But now that many governments and private institutions have made fighting the disease a high priority, its death toll has been halved over the last 15 years.
Still, the parasite that causes malaria is developing resistance to artemisinin, which forms the basis for the most effective treatment: artemisinin-based combination therapies.
Artemisinin resistance first emerged in Cambodia just over a decade ago, and has since spread through Thailand, Laos, Vietnam, Myanmar, and China.
It is now approaching India, and experts are sure that it will eventually reach Africa.
According to one recent study, if artemisinin resistance is allowed to spread, malaria will kill at least 116,000 more people every year.
Unless new treatments become available, the tremendous progress that the world has made against malaria will have been tragically short-lived.
Fortunately, those engaged in the global response to malaria recognize that just as parasites are adapting, so must we.
New efforts are underway to identify and minimize the spread of resistant malaria, while simultaneously developing new artemisinin-free treatments.
For example, the Regional Artemisinin-Resistance Initiative is working to halt the spread of resistant malaria in the Mekong Delta region, by monitoring and sharing drug-resistance data and promoting proper use of antimalarial treatments.
So far, the initiative has secured €110 million through the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria, which is financed primarily by governments.
Moreover, Novartis and the Medicines for Malaria Venture (with support from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation) are starting a new clinical trial next month to test KAF156, a molecule that could form the basis of a new treatment against artemisinin-resistant malaria strains.
At the 2016 World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, 100 companies (including Novartis) and industry associations signed the Davos Declaration on AMR.
Under that commitment, we promised to work together with governments to slow the development of resistance, by increasing our investments in R&D and making high-quality antibiotics available to patients who need them.
The G20’s national action plans will, we hope, help us to meet these commitments.
But political leaders, too, must marshal the will to turn words into action.
We urgently need more resources to monitor resistance, stronger incentives for R&D, and innovative financing mechanisms to ensure widespread access to accurate diagnoses and quality medicines.
The world cannot afford to lose the fight against AMR.
Winning it will require large-scale public-private cooperation, underpinned by political leadership that makes global public health a top priority.
The Shareholder Spring Continues
LONDON – It is annual general meeting season – the time of year when some of the world’s biggest companies gather to report to shareholders and have some semblance of a conversation with them.
For the next couple of months, a succession of companies will talk about what influenced their performance over the previous year, what they are planning for the future, and the decisions that their boards have made.
There was a time when these meetings took place without much fanfare, mostly unnoticed by the public.
That has not been true for a couple of years.
A worsening economy and widening inequality have spurred more people to become more engaged and take an interest in the activities of companies and those who run them.
And, with that change, attention has broadened from CEOs and executive teams to those who previously existed in a black box: the companies’ board members.
In 2012, shareholders and others started shining a bright light on boards, questioning their decisions and activities, and those of individual members, and thus was born the Shareholder Spring.
People grew tired of tone-deaf board directors operating in soundproof rooms, seemingly ignoring economic realities and the public’s mood.
They wanted to confront those who decide on executives’ often eye-popping compensation or approve companies’ decisions to undertake sophisticated tax engineering.
People wanted to know whether board members were actually doing their jobs or just filling seats and collecting a nice fee.
Many companies and company boards hoped that this heightened interest would pass quickly; instead, it has matured.
Discontent has continued to mount, and investors, employees, politicians, and members of the public now want to know not only about executive compensation, but also about the frequently staggering discrepancy between what companies’ highest- and lowest-paid personnel earn.
They want to know about living wages and zero-hours contracts.
They want to know what companies are doing to address climate change, whether they are responsible community members, how they behave in conflict zones, and much more.
Those asking the questions are no longer content to protest outside.
They are becoming increasingly sophisticated about how to be heard, buying shares, stepping up to the microphone, and looking board members in the eye, so that their questions become part of the official minutes.
And they are putting pressure on companies’ major investors to hold board members to account as well.
The questions posed and statements made can sometimes be longwinded.
But many of them are legitimate, and they are an important reminder to boards that they must serve the company’s entire ecosystem – investors, employees, customers, and community alike.
Indeed, these open meetings are a reminder that board members must ask the hard questions all year round, rather than simply rubber-stamping management proposals or going along to get along.
Interestingly, just as the movement to hold boards to account has gained greater traction, some companies have adopted new ways of convening annual shareholder meetings.
These were once fairly staid gatherings.
The companies’ senior management would walk investors and board members through the reporting formalities step by step, present results, take questions, vote, and move on.
There was tea, coffee, and biscuits, but nothing fancy.
In recent years, however, there has been a trend toward a more carnival-like atmosphere, with companies bringing in big-name entertainers and turning the event into a feel-good pep rally.
Last year, Wal-Mart’s annual meeting featured Harry Connick, Jr., Robin Thicke, and Pharrell Williams.
In 2013, Elton John performed.
In contrast, other companies have swung to the opposite extreme and embraced fully virtual meetings.
The board gathers in front of a camera for a live webcast to shareholders, takes questions submitted in advance, and avoids the protesters altogether.
This year, HP joined Sprint and Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia down this road.
There is a virtue to having a meeting with a virtual component: businesses are global, and so are their investors, who can participate without having to get on a plane.
But a webcast of a meeting with a live audience would be the ideal combination.
And while companies might argue that entirely virtual meetings save money – which of course is true – investors do not need Robin Thicke.
They will settle for good numbers, serious discussion, and a dry biscuit.
Boards and managers must take these meetings seriously.
Part of the job is facing those with something at stake.
Hosting circuses or hiding behind cameras will not keep tough questions from coming.
A seat at the boardroom table comes with the responsibility to stand up and do this vital part of the job – in person and without musical accompaniment.
The Abdication of the Left
RONDA, SPAIN – As the world reels from the Brexit shock, it is dawning on economists and policymakers that they severely underestimated the political fragility of the current form of globalization.
The popular revolt that appears to be underway is taking diverse, overlapping forms: reassertion of local and national identities, demand for greater democratic control and accountability, rejection of centrist political parties, and distrust of elites and experts.
This backlash was predictable.
Some economists, including me, did warn about the consequences of pushing economic globalization beyond the boundaries of institutions that regulate, stabilize, and legitimize markets.
Hyper-globalization in trade and finance, intended to create seamlessly integrated world markets, tore domestic societies apart.
The bigger surprise is the decidedly right-wing tilt the political reaction has taken.
In Europe, it is predominantly nationalists and nativist populists that have risen to prominence, with the left advancing only in a few places such as Greece and Spain.
In the United States, the right-wing demagogue Donald Trump has managed to displace the Republican establishment, while the leftist Bernie Sanders was unable to overtake the centrist Hillary Clinton.
As an emerging new establishment consensus grudgingly concedes, globalization accentuates class divisions between those who have the skills and resources to take advantage of global markets and those who don’t.
Income and class cleavages, in contrast to identity cleavages based on race, ethnicity, or religion, have traditionally strengthened the political left.
So why has the left been unable to mount a significant political challenge to globalization?
One answer is that immigration has overshadowed other globalization “shocks.”
The perceived threat of mass inflows of migrants and refugees from poor countries with very different cultural traditions aggravates identity cleavages that far-right politicians are exceptionally well placed to exploit.
So it is not a surprise that rightist politicians from Trump to Marine Le Pen lace their message of national reassertion with a rich dose of anti-Muslim symbolism.
Latin American democracies provide a telling contrast.
These countries experienced globalization mostly as a trade and foreign-investment shock, rather than as an immigration shock.
Globalization became synonymous with so-called Washington Consensus policies and financial opening.
Immigration from the Middle East or Africa remained limited and had little political salience.
So the populist backlash in Latin America – in Brazil, Bolivia, Ecuador, and, most disastrously, Venezuela – took a left-wing form.
The story is similar in the main two exceptions to right-wing resurgence in Europe – Greece and Spain.
In Greece, the main political fault line has been austerity policies imposed by European institutions and the International Monetary Fund.
In Spain, most immigrants until recently came from culturally similar Latin American countries.
In both countries, the far right lacked the breeding ground it had elsewhere.
But the experience in Latin America and southern Europe reveals perhaps a greater weakness of the left: the absence of a clear program to refashion capitalism and globalization for the twenty-first century.
From Greece’s Syriza to Brazil’s Workers’ Party, the left has failed to come up with ideas that are economically sound and politically popular, beyond ameliorative policies such as income transfers.
Economists and technocrats on the left bear a large part of the blame.
Instead of contributing to such a program, they abdicated too easily to market fundamentalism and bought in to its central tenets.
Worse still, they led the hyper-globalization movement at crucial junctures.
The enthroning of free capital mobility – especially of the short-term kind – as a policy norm by the European Union, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, and the IMF was arguably the most fateful decision for the global economy in recent decades.
As Harvard Business School professor Rawi Abdelal has shown, this effort was spearheaded in the late 1980s and early 1990s not by free-market ideologues, but by French technocrats such as Jacques Delors (at the European Commission) and Henri Chavranski (at the OECD), who were closely associated with the Socialist Party in France.
Similarly, in the US, it was technocrats associated with the more Keynesian Democratic Party, such as Lawrence Summers, who led the charge for financial deregulation.
France’s Socialist technocrats appear to have concluded from the failed Mitterrand experiment with Keynesianism in the early 1980s that domestic economic management was no longer possible, and that there was no real alternative to financial globalization.
The best that could be done was to enact Europe-wide and global rules, instead of allowing powerful countries like Germany or the US to impose their own.
The good news is that the intellectual vacuum on the left is being filled, and there is no longer any reason to believe in the tyranny of “no alternatives.”
Politicians on the left have less and less reason not to draw on “respectable” academic firepower in economics.
Consider just a few examples: Anat Admati and Simon Johnson have advocated radical banking reforms; Thomas Piketty and Tony Atkinson have proposed a rich menu of policies to deal with inequality at the national level; Mariana Mazzucato and Ha-Joon Chang have written insightfully on how to deploy the public sector to foster inclusive innovation; Joseph Stiglitz and José Antonio Ocampo have proposed global reforms; Brad DeLong, Jeffrey Sachs, and Lawrence Summers (the very same!) have argued for long-term public investment in infrastructure and the green economy.
There are enough elements here for building a programmatic economic response from the left.
A crucial difference between the right and the left is that the right thrives on deepening divisions in society – “us” versus “them” – while the left, when successful, overcomes these cleavages through reforms that bridge them.
Hence the paradox that earlier waves of reforms from the left – Keynesianism, social democracy, the welfare state – both saved capitalism from itself and effectively rendered themselves superfluous.
Absent such a response again, the field will be left wide open for populists and far-right groups, who will lead the world – as they always have – to deeper division and more frequent conflict.
Global Cooperation as a Life-and-Death Issue
LONDON – The uncertainty generated by the United Kingdom’s recent vote to leave the European Union – which has sent shockwaves through global markets – has been dominating headlines.
But, as we prepare to face new political trials, we must not lose sight of the challenges we already face, especially global health challenges like the rise of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), which has no regard for economic performance or political stability.
As it stands, an estimated 700,000 people are losing their lives to drug-resistant infections each year.
By 2050, this figure could skyrocket to ten million per year, at a cumulative cost to world GDP of $100 trillion..
To avoid that outcome, in May the Review on AMR that I lead published its strategy for tackling such infections, laying out proposals to ensure the development of the necessary new antibiotics, and to use existing antibiotics more efficiently in humans and agriculture.
Of the ten major interventions we proposed, four are particularly important:
· Launch a global campaign, tailored for different regions, to improve public awareness of AMR.
· Address the market failure in the development of new antibiotics by introducing lump-sum market-entry rewards to developers of successful new drugs, while ensuring global access.
· Advance innovation and improve use of diagnostic technology to support more efficient use of antibiotics.
· Implement country-level targets focused on reducing unnecessary use of antibiotics in agriculture and humans.
With our final report complete, the Review will now continue to make the international case for action directly to political leaders.
For example, in my capacity as the Review’s Chairman, I recently discussed our recommendations at the World Health Assembly in Geneva, and with United Nations and United States policymakers in New York and Washington, DC.
In these discussions, policymakers’ growing awareness of the danger posed by AMR stood out.
Just two years ago, the topic of drug-resistant infections would usually be met with questions like “What is AMR?” or, “Why would a finance minister take charge of a health crisis?”
Few understood the scale and multifaceted nature of the challenge, and thus the need for a comprehensive approach.
I asked myself similar questions when British Prime Minister David Cameron first asked me to lead the Review on AMR.
The situation has changed considerably since then.
Policymakers from countries with a wide variety of economic and political systems are engaging on the AMR problem, with some countries already taking steps to tackle it.
All of this provides grounds for hope that 2016 may be the year when real change gets underway.
But hope is one thing; action is another.
While high-level meetings and speeches about AMR send the right message, they will mean nothing if we do not manage to translate the current momentum into concrete action, beginning at the G20 and UN meetings this September.
And while my most recent discussions suggest that agreements are likely to be reached at both of these meetings, it is far from certain that they will match the scale of the problem.
At the G20, the needed agreement should focus on developing a global mechanism to re-invigorate the market for new antibiotics that are globally affordable, accessible, and used as efficiently as possible.
At the UN, the goal should be to turn the mantra of “access, not excess” into a reality, with an agreement to reduce the unnecessary use of antibiotics in agriculture, and to spearhead a global awareness campaign.
Increased funding for research and development of new antibiotics and diagnostics to fight AMR is also vital.
Crucially, the agreements must have teeth.
Countries should set their own objectives to fit their particular circumstances and needs, but there must be some provisions to ensure that all are pulling their weight.
For starters, efforts to fight AMR should be incorporated into broader economic-development strategies, including the implementation of the UN Sustainable Development Goals.
Moreover, progress should be measured, not only so that policymakers, companies, and health systems can be held accountable, but also so that others can emulate their successes.
To this end, we may need new metrics for calculating the impact of AMR.
While this sounds technical (and it is), the reality is that top AMR scientists think that agreeing on common measurements could change the way individual countries set their own targets and improve our capacity to measure progress in the coming years.
Finally, to account for changing political priorities and personalities, we need a constant champion in the fight against AMR.
For example, a UN envoy on AMR could be appointed, to continue making the international case for addressing the issue and to challenge countries to meet their targets.
Without such a consistent reminder of the need to tackle AMR, not to mention transparency about progress, the world could become sidetracked and miss the rapidly closing window of opportunity to deliver the changes needed to stop the rise of drug-resistant infections.
Over the last couple of years, governments, industry, and international organizations have made important strides in meeting the AMR threat.
But the really hard decisions must be taken now.
If we are to prevent the slow-motion car crash of rising AMR, our leaders must take evasive action now.
We know what we have to do; now we must get on with doing it.
Tackling AMR With the IMF
LONDON – This month is the first anniversary of the United Nations High-Level Meeting on Antimicrobial Resistance, which the United Kingdom’s independent Review on AMR helped to bring about.
That moment last year was very gratifying for me, as the chairman of the Review, as well as for my team and the UK’s Chief Medical Officer, Sally Davies.
Last year’s High-Level Meeting resolved that member-state delegates are to reconvene for a progress assessment after two years – so, in September 2018.
The meeting also called for the establishment of an Interagency Coordination Group to guide efforts in the fight against AMR during that two-year period.
From what I have gathered, the group is being led by deeply committed individuals.
And, more broadly, policymakers at the national and international levels have begun to pay more attention to the threat of AMR.
In fact, since the UN High-Level Meeting, the G20 has also made notable commitments in the battle against AMR.
At the G20 summit in Hamburg, Germany, in July, governments agreed to establish an “R&D Collaboration Hub,” and to begin to phase out antibiotics in agriculture, where producers use them to promote animal growth.
The UK Review recommended that an additional $2 billion be earmarked for early-stage research into AMR, so the creation of an R&D hub is very welcome.
But the agreement to limit the use of antibiotics in agriculture was even more significant.
In the past, key G20 member states have resisted such commitments.
And in the texts that served as a foundation for the UN High-Level Meeting, agriculture wasn’t even mentioned, owing to fear that it would render any eventual agreement dead on arrival.
The steps that the UN and the G20 have taken are encouraging.
But the fight against AMR is hardly over, and has probably only just begun.
Looking forward, one of the biggest challenges will be holding to account individual countries and multilateral organizations, such as the UN itself.
How will we confirm that governments and institutions have followed through on their lofty declarations?
For starters, we can look at the intersection of economics and public health.
There are many ways that international institutions can use economic-policy levers to reduce significantly the probability of infectious-disease outbreaks, and to increase vulnerable countries’ resilience to such risks.
To my mind, the International Monetary Fund should take the lead.
As Peter Sands and his colleagues show in a May 2016 study in The Lancet, infectious-disease outbreaks have far-reaching economic costs, and yet they are rarely, if ever, factored into assessments of macroeconomic risk.
The IMF already conducts regular reviews of countries’ economic health, and financial markets give significant weight to its analyses.
For the sake of economic as well as public health, the Fund would do well to start tracking countries’ progress in the fight against AMR as well.
The European Union declared more than ten years ago that it would fully phase out the use of antibiotics for animal growth promotion.
But who, other than the occasional investigative journalist, has ever actually delved into EU member states’ progress toward that goal?
In the UK, my Review colleagues and I were quite impressed by the government’s formal policy response to our recommendations, especially with respect to reducing antibiotic prescriptions, preventing hospital-acquired infections, and limiting the use of antibiotics in farming to 50 milligrams per kilogram of livestock.
Over the past year, I have given public talks at some of the British universities that are actively working on the AMR threat.
I have been encouraged to see more academic researchers pursuing this topic than in the past.
But when I have quizzed my audiences, I have come to realize that hardly anyone knows about the government’s policy response.
This could mean that my audiences are simply uninformed; but I doubt that.
What is more likely is that the government has not yet followed through on its commitments.
The IMF is ideally suited to get to the bottom of this question as a part of its routine economic assessments.
And its analyses would be even more valuable to less wealthy countries, where preventing outbreaks of infectious diseases could directly boost long-term economic growth.
One last concern that I have on this first anniversary of the UN High-Level Meeting is that policymakers still need to agree on a source of funding for the market-entry rewards intended to encourage the development of new drugs and diagnostics.
Such innovations will be crucial for preventing and detecting AMR, and an incentive mechanism to stimulate them is increasingly regarded as the right way to go.
That, too, is a topic on which the IMF could provide invaluable advice.
The Arab Autocracy Trap
TEL AVIV – It has been more than six years since the start of the Arab Spring, and life for most Arabs is worse than it was in 2011.
Unemployment is rife in the Middle East and North Africa, where two thirds of the population is between the ages of 15 and 29.
And throughout the region, regimes have closed off channels for political expression, and responded to popular protests with increasing brutality.
The governments of Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and, to some extent, Morocco, epitomize Arab regimes’ seeming inability to escape the autocracy trap – even as current circumstances suggest that another popular awakening is imminent.
Egypt offers a classic example of how revolution often ends in betrayal.
President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi’s dictatorship is even more violent than that of Hosni Mubarak, the strongman whose 30-year rule was ended by the 2011 uprising.
With the help of a police force that he himself describes as a “million-man mafia,” Sisi has made repression the paramount organizing principle of his regime.
It would be a Herculean feat for anyone to reform Egypt’s economy so that it benefits the country’s 95 million people (plus the two million added every year).
And it is a task that Egypt’s leaders cannot avoid, because the social contract of the Mubarak years, whereby Egyptians traded freedom for an expansive welfare state and generous subsidies, is no longer sustainable.
With youth unemployment at 40%, only a bold reformist president could pull Egypt back from the brink of economic disaster.
Sadly, rather than providing hope to the younger generation of Egyptians who protested in Tahrir Square six years ago, Sisi has stifled individual initiative and made the army the primary actor in the economy.
Perhaps fearing even greater social unrest, Sisi has yet to meet the conditions set last November by the International Monetary Fund as part of a $12 billion bailout.
These include drastically reducing the wage bill for Egypt’s bloated public sector, which still employs six million people (not counting the army and police); and reducing subsidies, which still constitute 30% of the national budget.
Moreover, Sisi has offered even fewer institutional channels for political expression than existed under the Mubarak-era one-party system.
According to the Egyptian Centre for Economic and Social Rights, there were five times more street protests in Egypt in 2016 than there were, on average, in the years preceding the Arab Spring.
A social volcano is forming; sooner or later, it will have to erupt.
In Saudi Arabia, the monarchical-theocratic regime weathered the Arab Spring with relative ease, because it could lavish its citizens with largesse.
But the kingdom’s social contract, like Egypt’s, has become unsustainable, owing to falling oil prices and a population that has grown by more than 25% in the last decade alone.
Earlier this year, the Saudi government was forced to cut public-sector salaries and subsidies on basic goods.
This represents a major risk for the regime (indeed, the salary cuts were quickly restored, after protests were called in four cities), not least because the state is the largest employer of Saudi citizens.
Many of the region’s autocrats have put their faith in the “China model” of non-democratic development.
But that model has clearly failed them.
It requires far too much socioeconomic and political regimentation to be workable under prevailing conditions in the Arab world.
This implies that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s ambitious plan to transform his country’s oil-based economy into a modern industrial economy will require a long and uncertain process.
Economic reforms will succeed only if they are coupled with far-reaching political reforms, which would inevitably shake the regime’s foundation.
Like Saudi Arabia, Morocco, another monarchy, came through the Arab Spring largely unscathed.
At the time, King Mohammed VI wisely responded to protesters by offering constitutional reforms and elections.
But Morocco is now facing its own “Tunisia moment,” reminiscent of the street vendor Mohamed Bouazizi’s self-immolation in 2010, in protest against state harassment.
Bouazizi’s desperate act sparked the Arab Spring.
And last year, Morocco experienced a gruesome echo of it when the merchant Mouhcine Fikri was crushed to death in a trash compactor while trying to retrieve fish confiscated by the authorities.
Fikri’s death triggered a wave of protests across the northern Rif, a region with a long history of rebelliousness.
Revolutionary conditions often give rise to previously unknown leaders.
In the Rif, a 39-year-old unemployed man named Nasser Zefzafi led protests that quickly spread to other parts of the country.
Through online videos, he delivered fiery speeches in the local vernacular against government corruption and Morocco’s “dictatorship.”
And on June 11, the capital, Rabat, was the site of the largest popular protest since the outbreak of the Arab Spring.
Unlike his father, King Hassan II, Mohammed has supported the region’s indigenous Berber culture, and made investments to turn the Rif coastal region into a manufacturing hub.
But progress has been erratic, because the monarchy has maintained a tight grip on all government-led economic initiatives.
Investments that were promised in 2015 have yet to materialize.
Still, Morocco’s monarchy has always been a step ahead of other Arab regimes when it comes to devising calculated responses to the popular mood.
This political savvy, combined with the country’s improving economy, could help the regime weather today’s turbulence and the next violent upheaval.
But the government will also have to follow through on the political reforms it promised in 2011; loosen its grip on the economy; and promote inclusive growth and prosperity, including by addressing deep regional disparities.
When complacent kings and “elected” autocrats do not respond to public protests with a controlled revolution from above, they inevitably face a much fiercer revolution from below.
For the Arab regimes, neither the promise of subsidies nor the threat of repression can squeeze the political genie back into its bottle.
How Can the Arab World Avoid the Abyss?
CAIRO – A series of startling events in November revealed the abysmal state of affairs in the Arab world.
The Lebanese prime minister announced his resignation abroad, but reversed the statement later.
A missile was launched from Yemen toward Saudi Arabia’s capital, Riyadh. Saudi Arabia’s leadership carried out a major anti-corruption campaign that affected dozens of high-profile personalities.
Egypt, meanwhile, experienced its worst terrorist attack in living memory, with more than 300 civilians killed and injured.
Video footage of alleged slave auctions in Libya underscored the continuing chaos there amid the complete breakdown of the Libyan state.
Military victories against the Islamic State and a rapprochement between Palestinian factions in Gaza and the West Bank have done little to ease a collective sense of anxiety in the region.
Nor have these positive developments inspired much confidence that the Arab world will somehow pull itself back from the edge of the abyss.
Foreign interference has become routine in Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, and Yemen.
And ongoing debates over identity politics and borders in the Levant are a prelude to the grave, fundamental challenges ahead.
In fact, the situation in the Middle East is not surprising, given that in recent years no Arab country has led attempts to resolve the ongoing conflicts in Libya, Syria, and Yemen, let alone address the Palestine-Israel issue.
In many of these conflicts, foreigners have had far more influence than Arabs.
Historically, the Middle East has been the target of numerous foreign invasions, from the Crusades to European colonialism.
Its natural resources have been greedily usurped, and it was a theater for proxy wars during the Cold War.
Even today, Arab territories remain under occupation.
But while there are many reasons to blame foreign powers for the region’s parlous state of affairs, blaming others – or even one another – will solve nothing.
After all, the Arab world has many homegrown problems, too, including inefficient and ineffective governance, unholy alliances, and undeveloped national capacities.
Disaster awaits any region that is helpless to shape its own future, in which a majority of citizens feel disenfranchised.
Though the Arab world is traditionally conservative, almost 70% of its citizens are below the age of 35, and young people suffer from the highest rates of unemployment in most countries.
This constitutes not only a tremendous waste of resources, but also a serious long-term sociopolitical problem.
And yet it is just one of the many domestic challenges facing the region.
Arabs must take charge of their own agenda, and become the primary force defining their future and that of their countries.
They should, of course, continue to engage with the outside world and strengthen their strategic relationships and alliances.
But they also must become less dependent on others.
For starters, the region’s governments need to develop their own national-security capacities, to defend against non-existential threats and hegemonic expansionism.
This, in turn, will enhance their political influence, and give them more diplomatic tools for addressing regional problems and preventing military conflicts.
Moreover, Arabs must defend their national identities.
The Middle East’s nation-state system is not perfect, but it is far better than religious or ethnic sectarianism, which threaten to destabilize the region even further.
To avoid that outcome, the region’s existing nation-states will need strong institutions to provide for efficient governance and social inclusion.
Unfortunately, most Arab countries’ institutions are nowhere near being able to meet this imperative.
Looking ahead, Arabs should recognize that domestic reform is the best way to prevent foreign interference and defend national interests.
The Arab awakenings over the last few years revealed a centrist middle-class yearning for change.
Opportunistic parties tried to benefit from the turbulent environment created by sudden change.
But this does not negate the fact that these movements were a response to perpetually bad governance and a failure on the part of Arab leaders to pursue gradual reforms.
Arabs also need to give themselves a larger variety of economic, political, and security options, so that they can adapt to changing circumstances.
The world is no longer bipolar or Eurocentric.
In fact, it is the Westphalian state system itself, not just the postwar geopolitical paradigm, which is being tested by rapid technological, economic, and social changes.
Lastly, the Arab world needs to confront regional hegemonic attitudes and the illegitimate occupation of Arab lands.
Solutions to current problems must respect people’s aspirations for statehood and sovereignty, while going beyond tactical or transactional approaches that provide only short-term relief.
Ultimately, any policy that fails to protect basic rights will not succeed.
Arab countries, individually and collectively, will need a fully formed strategy to confront existential foreign and domestic threats to their sovereignty and security in the coming years.
It is high time for Arab leaders to outline a vision for the future of inter-Arab relations, and a plan for engaging with their non-Arab neighbors on regional opportunities and challenges.
Last but not least, Arab leaders must also explain how they will provide better domestic governance for their people.
If the Arab world wants to have a say in shaping its own future, it cannot remain complacent in the present.
Its leaders and people must start planning now.
Springtime for Fascism?
NEW YORK – Are we seeing a new dawn of fascism?
Many people are beginning to think so.
Donald Trump has been compared to a fascist, as has Vladimir Putin and a variety of demagogues and right-wing loudmouths in Europe.
The recent tide of authoritarian bluster has reached as far as the Philippines, whose president-elect, Rodrigo (“The Punisher”) Duterte, has vowed to toss suspected criminals into Manila Bay.
The problem with terms like “fascism” or “Nazi” is that so many ignorant people have used them so often, in so many situations, that they have long ago lost any real significance.
Few still know firsthand what fascism actually meant.
It has become a catch-all phrase for people or ideas we don't like.
Loose rhetoric has coarsened not only political debate, but historical memory, too.
When a Republican politician compares US property taxes with the Holocaust, as one Senate candidate did in 2014, the mass murder of Jews is trivialized to the extent of becoming meaningless.
The same is roughly true when Trump is compared to Hitler or Mussolini.
As a result, we are too easily distracted from the real dangers of modern demagoguery.
After all, it is not hard for Trump – or the Netherlands’ Geert Wilders, or Putin, or Duterte – to refute accusations of being fascists or Nazis.
They may be repulsive, but they are not organizing uniformed storm troopers, building concentration camps, or calling for the corporate state.
Putin comes closest, but even he is not Hitler.
Of course, forgetfulness or ignorance about the past goes both ways.
When a young Dutch writer, sympathetic to the new populist wave, expressed antipathy to his country’s “cultural elite,” for promoting “atonal music” and other arrogant forms of ugliness, instead of the wholesome beauty embraced by the common man, I wondered whether he knew about the Nazis’ attack on “degenerate art”?
Atonal music, hardly the cutting edge today, was precisely the kind of thing that Hitler’s minions loathed – and ultimately banned.
There are other echoes of our darkest history in contemporary political bombast, which a few decades ago would still have cast any politician who used it to the margins.
Stoking hatred of minorities, fulminating against the press, stirring up the mob against intellectuals, financiers, or anyone who speaks more than one language, were not part of mainstream politics, because enough people still understood the dangers of such talk.
It is clear that today's demagogues don’t much care about what they derisively call “political correctness.”
It is less clear whether they have enough historical sense to know that they are poking a monster that post-World War II generations hoped was dead but that we now know only lay dormant, until obliviousness to the past could enable it to be reawakened.
This is not to say that everything the populists say is untrue.
Hitler, too, was right to grasp that mass unemployment was a problem in Germany.
Many of the agitators’ bugbears are indeed worthy of criticism: the European Union’s opacity, the duplicitousness and greed of Wall Street bankers, the reluctance to tackle problems caused by mass immigration, the lack of concern for those hurt by economic globalization.
These are all problems that mainstream political parties have been unwilling or unable to solve.
But when today’s populists start blaming “the elites,” whoever they may be, and unpopular ethnic or religious minorities, for these difficulties, they sound uncomfortably close to the enemies of liberal democracy in the 1930s.
The true mark of the illiberal demagogue is talk of “betrayal.”
The cosmopolitan elites have stabbed “us” in the back; we are facing an abyss; our culture is being undermined by aliens; our nation can become great again once we eliminate the traitors, shut down their voices in the media, and unite the “silent majority” to revive the healthy national organism.
Politicians and their boosters who express themselves in this manner may not be fascists; but they certainly talk like them.
The fascists and Nazis of the 1930s did not come from nowhere.
Their ideas were hardly original.
For many years, intellectuals, activists, journalists, and clerics had articulated hateful ideas that laid the groundwork for Mussolini, Hitler, and their imitators in other countries.
Some were Catholic reactionaries who detested secularism and individual rights.
Some were obsessed with the supposed global domination of Jews.
Some were romantics in search of an essential racial or national spirit.
Most modern demagogues may be only vaguely aware of these precedents, if they know of them at all.
In Central European countries like Hungary, or indeed in France, they may actually understand the links quite well, and some of today’s far-right politicians are not shy about being openly anti-Semitic.
In most West European countries, however, such agitators use their professed admiration for Israel as a kind of alibi, and direct their racism at Muslims.
Words and ideas have consequences.
Today’s populist leaders should not yet be compared to murderous dictators of the fairly recent past.
But, by exploiting the same popular sentiments, they are contributing to a poisonous climate, which could bring political violence into the mainstream once again.
Are Democrats Really Better for America’s Economy?
CAMBRIDGE – Hillary Clinton has repeatedly claimed in recent months that the US economy does much better when a Democrat is in the White House.
Coming from the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, that probably sounds like political spin.
But the truth is that she is absolutely right.
The president, no doubt, is but one of many factors shaping the economy, and some presidents have certainly been luckier than others.
But that doesn’t mean that Clinton’s claim is only “half true,” as asserted by some media fact-checkers (including the Pulitzer Prize-winning PolitiFact).
The difference in economic performance under Democratic and Republican presidents is consistent and substantial, with the disparities clearly above the threshold for statistical significance.
Princeton University economists Alan Blinder and Mark Watson confirm this Democratic dividend in a recent study.
Their starting point is the observation that in the post-World War II period (from Harry Truman to Barack Obama), annual GDP growth has averaged 4.3% during Democratic administrations, compared to 2.5% under Republicans.
If one goes back further, to include Herbert Hoover and Franklin D. Roosevelt, the disparity is even larger.
The results are similar even if one assigns responsibility for the first three months – or the first few quarters – of a president’s term to his predecessor.
But there is more.
Over the 256 quarters in the 16 post-war presidential terms, the US economy was in recession for an average of 1.1 quarters during Democratic presidencies and 4.6 quarters during the Republican terms.
The odds that such a large difference is the result of mere chance are no more than one in 100.
And the trend is not restricted to GDP.
Since 1945, the unemployment rate fell by 0.8 percentage points under Democrats, on average, and rose by 1.1 percentage points under Republicans – a remarkable difference of 1.9 percentage points.
The structural budget deficit has also been smaller under Democratic presidents (1.5% of potential GDP) than when Republicans have been in office (2.2%), though this has not stopped Republicans from criticizing Democrats for excessive spending.
Even returns on the S&P 500 have been substantially higher under Democrats – 8.4% versus 2.7%.
(This differential is not as significant statistically, however, because equity prices are so volatile.)
The likelihood that luck alone could have produced such large and consistent differences in economic performance is extremely low – a point that can be illustrated even without fancy econometrics.
Take the recession record.
If the chances of a recession starting during a Democratic or a Republican president’s term were equal, the odds of four successive recessions beginning under Republicans would be 16 to one – the same as getting “heads” on four out of four coin-flips.
That is not particularly likely, yet it is exactly what happened in the last 35 years.
If one were to go back ten business cycles assuming an equal chance of a recession starting under a Democratic or a Republican president, the odds become even longer.
There is only a 100-to-one chance that nine out of the last ten recessions would have begun under Republican presidents.
Yet they did, as confirmed by the NBER Business Cycle Dating Committee.
An even more startling fact emerges from a review of the last eight times an incumbent from one party was succeeded by a president from the other party.
In the four transitions when a Republican took office, GDP growth slowed; in the other four transitions, when a Democrat moved in, the growth rate went up.
That is as unlikely as getting heads on eight coin tosses in a row – a one-in-256 shot.
Democrats thus have not succeeded by luck alone.
(In fact, Blinder and Watson also observe that the US economy performs better when Democrats control Congress or have appointed the Federal Reserve chair, though the main determinant remains the party of the president.)
So what accounts for the partisan performance gap?
Blinder and Watson suggest that five factors – oil shocks, productivity growth, defense spending, foreign economic growth, and consumer confidence – may together explain 56% of the growth gap.
But it is impossible to know the extent to which these factors were influenced by the US president’s policies.
We know even less about the factors responsible for the other 44% of the performance gap.
In assessing Clinton’s statements on this topic, the fact-checkers make much of the finding by Blinder and Watson that, contrary to widespread assumptions, fiscal and monetary policies are not more “pro-growth” or expansionary under Democrats than under Republican presidents, and therefore cannot explain the performance differential.
But presidents make many policy decisions – concerning energy, anti-trust, regulation, trade, labor, and foreign policy, to name a few – beyond how much fiscal and monetary stimulus to pursue.
There is no way to test econometrically this myriad of policies.
It is this uncertainty that has driven the fact-checkers to rate Clinton’s statements as half-true.
But she never attempted to pinpoint particular policies to explain the performance gap.
All she said was that the US economy does better under Democratic presidents.
That is 100% true.
Mapping the Future of AI
BRIGHTON – Artificial intelligence already plays a major role in human economies and societies, and it will play an even bigger role in the coming years.
To ponder the future of AI is thus to acknowledge that the future is AI.
This will be partly owing to advances in “deep learning,” which uses multilayer neural networks that were first theorized in the 1980s.
With today’s greater computing power and storage, deep learning is now a practical possibility, and a deep-learning application gained worldwide attention in 2016 by beating the world champion in Go.
Commercial enterprises and governments alike hope to adapt the technology to find useful patterns in “Big Data” of all kinds.
In 2011, IBM’s Watson marked another AI watershed, by beating two previous champions in Jeopardy!, a game that combines general knowledge with lateral thinking.
And yet another significant development is the emerging “Internet of Things,” which will continue to grow as more gadgets, home appliances, wearable devices, and publicly-sited sensors become connected and begin to broadcast messages around the clock.
Big Brother won’t be watching you; but a trillion little brothers might be.
Beyond these innovations, we can expect to see countless more examples of what were once called “expert systems”: AI applications that aid, or even replace, human professionals in various specialties.
Similarly, robots will be able to perform tasks that could not be automated before.
Already, robots can carry out virtually every role that humans once filled on a warehouse floor.
Given this trend, it is not surprising that some people foresee a point known as the “Singularity,” when AI systems will exceed human intelligence, by intelligently improving themselves.
At that point, whether it is in 2030 or at the end of this century, the robots will truly have taken over, and AI will consign war, poverty, disease, and even death to the past.
To all of this, I say: Dream on.
Artificial general intelligence (AGI) is still a pipe dream.
It’s simply too difficult to master.
And while it may be achieved one of these days, it is certainly not in our foreseeable future.
But there are still major developments on the horizon, many of which will give us hope for the future.
For example, AI can make reliable legal advice available to more people, and at a very low cost.
And it can help us tackle currently incurable diseases and expand access to credible medical advice, without requiring additional medical specialists.
In other areas, we should be prudently pessimistic – not to say dystopian – about the future.
AI has worrying implications for the military, individual privacy, and employment.
Automated weapons already exist, and they could eventually be capable of autonomous target selection.
As Big Data becomes more accessible to governments and multinational corporations, our personal information is being increasingly compromised.
And as AI takes over more routine activities, many professionals will be deskilled and displaced.
The nature of work itself will change, and we may need to consider providing a “universal income,” assuming there is still a sufficient tax base through which to fund it.
A different but equally troubling implication of AI is that it could become a substitute for one-on-one human contact.
To take a trivial example, think about the annoyance of trying to reach a real person on the phone, only to be passed along from one automated menu to another.
Sometimes, this is vexing simply because you cannot get the answer you need without the intervention of human intelligence.
Or, it may be emotionally frustrating, because you are barred from expressing your feelings to a fellow human being, who would understand, and might even share your sentiments.
Other examples are less trivial, and I am particularly worried about computers being used as “carers” or “companions” for elderly people.
To be sure, AI systems that are linked to the Internet and furnished with personalized apps could inform and entertain a lonely person, as well as monitor their vital signs and alert physicians or family members when necessary.
Domestic robots could prove to be very useful for fetching food from the fridge and completing other household tasks.
But whether an AI system can provide genuine care or companionship is another matter altogether.
Those who believe that this is possible assume that natural-language processing will be up to the task.
But “the task” would include having emotionally-laden conversations about people’s personal memories.
While an AI system might be able to recognize a limited range of emotions in someone’s vocabulary, intonation, pauses, or facial expressions, it will never be able to match an appropriate human response.
It might say, “I’m sorry you’re sad about that,” or, “What a lovely thing to have happened!”
But either phrase would be literally meaningless.
A demented person could be “comforted” by such words, but at what cost to their human dignity?
The alternative, of course, is to keep humans in these roles.
Rather than replacing humans, robots can be human aids.
Today, many human-to-human jobs that involve physical and emotional caretaking are undervalued.
Ideally, these jobs will gain more respect and remuneration in the future.
But perhaps that is wishful thinking.
Ultimately, the future of AI – our AI future – is bright.
But the brighter it becomes, the more shadows it will cast.
ASEAN at 50
SINGAPORE – We live in troubled times, with pessimism clouding even the most prosperous parts of the planet.
Many are convinced that the international order is falling apart.
Some fear that a clash of civilizations is imminent, if it has not already begun.
Yet, amid the gloom, Southeast Asia offers an unexpected glimmer of hope.
The region has made extraordinary progress in recent decades, achieving a level of peace and prosperity that was previously unimaginable.
And it owes much of this success to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), which marks its 50th anniversary this month.
Southeast Asia is one of the world’s most diverse regions.
Its 640 million people include 240 million Muslims, 120 million Christians, 150 million Buddhists, and millions of Hindus, Taoists, Confucianists, and Communists.
Its most populous country, Indonesia, is home to 261 million people, while Brunei has just 450,000.
Singapore’s per capita income of $52,960 per annum is 22.5 times that of Laos ($2,353).
This diversity puts Southeast Asia at a distinct disadvantage in terms of fostering regional cooperation.
When ASEAN was founded in 1967, most experts expected it to die within a few years.
At the time, Southeast Asia was a poor and deeply troubled region, which the British historian C.A. Fisher had described as the Balkans of Asia.
The Vietnam War was underway, and the Sino-Vietnamese War was yet to be fought.
Many viewed the five non-Communist states that founded ASEAN – Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand – as dominoes, set to be tipped over by a neighbor’s fall to communism or descent into civil strife.
But ASEAN defied expectations, becoming the world’s second most successful regional organization, after the European Union.
Some 1,000 ASEAN meetings are held each year to deepen cooperation in areas such as education, health, and diplomacy.
ASEAN has signed free-trade agreements (FTAs) with China, Japan, India, South Korea, Australia, and New Zealand, and established an ASEAN economic community.
Today, ASEAN comprises the world’s seventh-largest economy, on track to become the fourth largest by 2050.
As I explain in my book The ASEAN Miracle, several factors have underpinned the bloc’s success.
At first, anti-communism provided a powerful incentive to collaborate.
Strong leaders, like Indonesia’s Suharto, former Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohammed, and Singapore’s founding father Lee Kuan Yew, held the group together.
It helped that as ASEAN was getting off the ground in the late 1960s and early 1970s, the strategic interests of America, China, and the bloc’s members converged.
But even when the Cold War ended, the region did not erupt into conflict, as the real Balkans did.
ASEAN countries maintained the cooperative habits that had become established in Southeast Asia in the 1970s and 1980s.
In fact, ASEAN’s erstwhile communist enemies – Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam – decided to join the bloc.
So, too, did Myanmar, ending decades of isolation.
ASEAN’s policy of engaging Myanmar attracted criticism from the West, but it helped lay the groundwork for a peaceful transition from military rule.
(Compare this to the West’s policy of isolation toward, say, Syria, which certainly won’t lead to a similar outcome.)
To be sure, ASEAN is far from perfect.
Over the short term, it seems to move like a crab – two steps forward, one step back, and one step sideways.
Yet ASEAN’s long-term progress is undeniable.
Its combined GDP has grown from $95 billion in 1970 to $2.5 trillion in 2014.
And it is the only reliable platform for geopolitical engagement in the Asia-Pacific region, unique in its ability to convene meetings attended by all of the world’s great powers, from the United States and the European Union to China and Russia.
ASEAN continues to face serious challenges.
Territorial disputes in the South China Sea have created deep divisions, and the intensifying geopolitical rivalry between the US and China poses a further threat to cohesion.
And domestic politics in several member states, including Malaysia and Thailand, is becoming increasingly chaotic.
But ASEAN’s history suggests that the bloc can weather these storms.
Its impressive resilience is rooted in the culture of musyawarah and mufakat (consultation and consensus) championed by Indonesia.
Imagine how other regional organizations, such as the Gulf Cooperation Council or the South Asian Association of Regional Cooperation, could benefit from adherence to such norms.
The EU once amounted to the gold standard for regional cooperation.
But it continues to struggle with a seemingly never-ending series of crises and weak economic growth.
Add to that the impending departure of the United Kingdom, and it seems only prudent to seek other models of cooperation.
ASEAN, however imperfect, provides an attractive one.
The EU was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2012.
But ASEAN’s approach may turn out to be the way of the future, enabling other fractious regions to develop sturdy bonds of cooperation, too.
To Resist the Robots, Invest in People
MANILA – A knitting factory in Bangladesh brings together the past, present, and future.
On one floor, workers knit by hand.
On another, people and machines do the work together.
And on a third floor, there are only robots.
This building might seem like an anachronism, given the accepted wisdom that robots will replace humans in textiles and many other industries.
But it is actually a savvy response to how the Fourth Industrial Revolution will likely play out in Asia.
As is the case elsewhere, technological advances are rapidly transforming industries and economies, by blurring the boundaries between the physical, digital, and biological worlds.
And yet much of Asia isn’t ready for robots, for reasons that go beyond fears of mass unemployment.
In 2014, China had just 11 robots per 10,000 employees in non-automotive industries, and just 213 per 10,000 employees on automotive assembly lines.
That is hundreds fewer than in Japan, the United States, or Germany.
Although China is closing the gap by increasing its spending on robots, poorer countries face significant barriers to adopting new technologies.
Moreover, the region’s lower wages give firms an incentive to retain human workers.
At the factory in Bangladesh, human workers can step in if power outages or equipment failures knock the machines offline.
At the same time, having a fully automated section allows production to continue if workers go on strike.
Conventional wisdom decrees that this dual-track approach isn’t sustainable, and that low- to middle-skilled workers will eventually make way for robots.
A landmark 2013 study by Carl Frey and Michael Osborne of Oxford University suggests that, in the coming decades, 47% of total US employment will be at risk of automation.
Similarly, the International Labour Organization (ILO) has warned that 56% of total employment in Cambodia, Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam is “at high risk of displacement due to technology over the next decade or two.”
But these grim predictions ignore the fact that most jobs comprise a bundle of tasks, some of which cannot be automated.
According to a 2016 OECD study that breaks down occupations by task, only 9% of jobs on average across 21 OECD countries are really at risk.
The same logic applies to Asia.
In Vietnam, for example, the share of jobs at risk falls from the ILO’s predicted 70% to just 15% when the country’s large informal economy is taken into account.
Street sweepers in developing countries are arguably less threatened by automation than their counterparts in developed countries, because their jobs are less mechanized and lower paid.
Still, robots are gaining a foothold in the region, particularly in economies such as China and South Korea.
In 2015, robot sales in Asia increased by 19% – the fourth record-breaking year in a row.
When less-developed Asian countries eventually join the technology bandwagon, layoffs will inevitably ensue.
To soften the blow, governments urgently need to pursue labor-market reforms and overhaul their education systems, starting with technical and vocational education and training (TVET).
Although TVET is becoming increasingly popular in Asia’s developing economies, its quality is often poor.
Governments should ensure that TVET courses focus on more relevant skills, while remaining flexible so that students can study without sacrificing income.
One option is to expand the availability of modular short courses, which take less time, train for specific tasks rather than entire jobs, and are more manageable for entrants who need, first and foremost, to earn money.
In Myanmar, for example, the government has launched a pilot program to target the country’s “missing million” students who drop out of school each year.
The program offers short courses on welding and other skills needed to repair rural machinery.
Competency-based assessment systems could also be particularly useful, given Asia’s large informal workforce.
Programs offering skilled workers a chance to earn certifications based on their work experience would allow for, say, uncertified electricians to find formal employment in robotics.
The private sector can also help produce more graduates with job-ready skills.
Asian countries should take a cue from India’s National Skill Development Corporation, which works with private training firms to match skills curricula with industry needs.
So far, India’s program has helped train more than 63,000 people.
Furthermore, governments should offer subsidies or tax incentives to companies that invest in the skills that humans master better than machines, such as communication and negotiation.
They will also have to adopt more flexible labor regulations, because firms won’t hire skilled workers who cost too much.
At the end of the day, Asia’s developing countries need policies that support workers, rather than jobs.
All parties can benefit from flexible contracts and lifelong learning and retraining opportunities.
Retraining is particularly important, because automation will create entirely new industries and occupations.
The McKinsey Global Institute estimates that automation could boost global productivity growth by 0.8-1.4% annually, generating large savings and performance gains for businesses.
Improving access to training and certification would help countries capitalize on these advances and ensure more equitable growth, by giving workers the skills needed to handle the new jobs.
That outcome would be good for workers and for Asian economies.
It would mean that businesses like the factory in Bangladesh could operate solely with robots, while its former workers would be gainfully employed elsewhere, most likely in jobs that don’t even exist yet.
Asian Cities’ Endless Summer
POTSDAM/MANILA – It’s monsoon season in Asia – marking an end to months of scorching temperatures.
But the extreme heat will return, with cities facing particularly brutal conditions.
Already, Asia’s urban areas experience twice as many hot days as its rural areas do – and could experience ten times as many by 2100.
At that point, there will be no reversing the trend.
The first detailed assessment of climate risk for Asia, carried out by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK), makes clear that Asia’s cities stand at the frontline of the fight against climate change.
Indeed, many consequences of a hotter planet – such as more extreme weather events, sea-level rise, environmental migration, and mounting social tensions – intersect in urban areas.
This is particularly true in Asia, where cities house more than half of the population and produce almost 80% of economic output.
By 2050, Asia’s urban population could nearly double, to three billion people.
Without new climate initiatives, the region’s cities could contribute more than half of the increase in global greenhouse-gas emissions over the next 20 years.
Such a scenario is often called “business as usual.”
Yet, in reality, it is business as usual that would be disrupted by the consequences of climate change, with unfettered warming impeding or even reversing Asia’s recent economic progress.
The longer we wait to address the climate challenge, the more devastating the disruption will be.
And we may not get much warning, because climate effects generally do not evolve in a linear fashion, but rather emerge suddenly and powerfully, once certain tipping points have been reached.
So far, not nearly enough has been done to assess Asia’s exposure to climate impacts, much less to strengthen protections for vulnerable areas or reduce greenhouse-gas emissions.
The region needs low-carbon green growth strategies that use less land, water, and energy.
These strategies will help to slow rapid urbanization, which entails dense construction, sealed roads, and private cars – all of which contribute to the “urban heat island” effect.
If we continue on our current path, the mean temperature over the Asian landmass could soar by more than 6°C (10.8°F), relative to pre-industrial levels, by 2100.
People may fall ill and even die from respiratory and other ailments caused by heat stress or pollution.
Beyond the human costs, higher temperatures would undermine agricultural and industrial productivity.
Climate-driven migration flows will exacerbate the challenges Asian cities face.
Unless a sufficient number of decent jobs are created, climate migrants could become a permanent underclass.
Even if jobs are available, the environmental pressure created by ever-more populated cities will pose a grave threat.
Yet projections of the impact of climate change on migration in Asia remain indefensibly limited in number, scope, and predictive power.
In order to improve city planning and health-care services, we need a simple and accurate way to assess current and future heat-tolerance levels among urban populations.
We also need strategies to decrease urban heat stress, including a shift toward polycentric urban configurations, with economies and societies built around multiple regional hubs, rather than concentrated around a single city, and natural assets maintained through eco-corridors and connected green spaces.
But rising temperatures are far from the only threat posed by climate change.
Extreme weather events, from droughts to floods, will intensify and become more frequent.
In Asia, increased rainfall and worsening tropical cyclones will wreak havoc on food production, driving down rural incomes.
In Sri Lanka, for example, rice yields could drop by up to 20% by 2050; in Fiji, cassava output could plummet by 36%.
All of this would be exacerbated by rising sea levels, which could be 1.4 meters (4.6 feet) higher by the end of the century, potentially causing many countries to lose more than 10% of their land area.
If countries meet their commitments under the Paris climate agreement, the total sea-level rise could be halved, with more ambitious schemes promising even greater reductions.
If, however, we continue on our current path for just a couple more decades, we could trigger centuries of rising sea levels, even if we subsequently ended all greenhouse-gas emissions. The effects would be gradual but merciless.
The risks are arguably highest on Asia’s crowded coastlines, where millions of people are exposed to flooding.
And those risks continue to mount: in countries such as Bangladesh, India, the Philippines, and Vietnam, coastal populations are expected to double by 2060.
Asia is home to 13 of the 20 global cities expected to experience the sharpest increases in annual economic loss due to floods between now and 2050.
As it stands, the risks of sea-level rise for Asia’s coastal urban centers are still not sufficiently understood, nor have they been adequately integrated into planning processes.
This must change.
In flood-prone countries, city-planning schemes should blend gray infrastructure, such as drainage systems, dikes, and sea walls, with green measures, like conservation of wetlands and forests.
Improved meteorological observations and early-warning systems would also help substantially.
But here, again, there is a lack of adequate knowledge and preparation.
There is no systematic analysis of the economic costs and benefits of coastal fortification relative to other approaches.
“Softer” interventions, like better land-use planning and ecosystem-based approaches, are widely supported, but their effectiveness has been assessed in only a few small-scale studies.
Flood risks could complicate energy-infrastructure development in coastal cities in countries like Bangladesh and India.
Here, at least, the way forward is clearer: closer regional cooperation would help to offset power shortages, while off-grid energy from renewables and climate-resilient supply networks would help countries to enhance their energy security.
Given Asia’s massive size, population, and economic importance, it must be at the center of global efforts to mitigate climate change.
In many ways, Asia’s cities hold Earth’s future in their hands.
They must do their utmost to protect it.
Asia’s Hierarchies of Humiliation
PHILADELPHIA – Indian and Chinese troops have been locked in a standoff in Doka La – where the borders of Bhutan, China and India meet – for almost a month now, the longest such impasse between the two armies since 1962.
In a not-so-subtle reference to that last conflict, in which India suffered a disastrous defeat, the Ministry of National Defense spokesperson Colonel Wu Qian has warned India to “learn from historical lessons.”
But the lessons of history have a peculiar tendency to adapt to the perspective of those citing them.
The current Chinese leadership sees in the 1962 conflict the price an uppity neighbor had to pay for not acceding to its territorial demands.
But, for India, that conflict was a humiliation that has rankled the country for more than a half-century.
The reminder of it is therefore likely to have the opposite effect than Wu anticipated.
In international relations, to be humiliated means more than to be embarrassed.
It amounts to the public degradation of another actor, a denial of its bid for status, and the establishment of a clear hierarchy.
Wars provide the opportunity for humiliation in very stark ways, because defeat on the battlefield tends to bring not just ridicule and derision, but also clear losses, particularly of territory.
If any country should understand the impact that such humiliations can have, it is China.
In fact, as Wu was relaying his message to India, Chinese President Xi Jinping was asserting, at the commemoration of the 20th anniversary of Hong Kong’s handover to China, that the move had ended the “humiliation and sorrow” inflicted by Britain when it took over the city in 1842.
This reflects the Chinese Communist Party’s broader use of China’s “century of humiliation,” which allegedly ended only when the CCP established the People’s Republic in 1949, to fuel a resurgent nationalism.
During that period, China’s self-image as East Asia’s preeminent power was shattered by a series of defeats, which were particularly painful when inflicted by the upstart Japan.
Despite this acute awareness of the enduring impact of its own humiliations, China often fails to recognize how its own past actions might have spurred similar feelings in others.
Its 1962 defeat of India was the culmination of a decade-long competition for leadership of the newly independent countries that had emerged from decolonization.
It therefore amounted to a devastating blow to India’s aspirations to be the undisputed leader of the Non-Aligned Movement.
India is far from the only country that has been humiliated at the hands of China.
In Vietnam, the phrase “1,000 Years of Chinese Domination” has as much resonance as “100 Years of Foreign Humiliation” has in China.
But China is not the only country to have been humiliated and humiliated others in turn.
While India was humiliated by China in 1962, it also inflicted what its neighbor Pakistan remembers as a humiliating defeat nine years later.
Since independence in 1947, Pakistan had vied to establish itself as India’s equal in South Asia, joining alliances led by the United States or cozying up to China to demonstrate its strategic relevance.
The 1971 Indo-Pakistani War, which led to the independence of East Pakistan (now Bangladesh), crushed those hopes.
Yet Pakistan, too, remains oblivious to the humiliating impact of its own actions: its nearly four-decade-long history of interference in Afghanistan to secure “strategic depth” will leave Afghanistan traumatized for years to come, in a way that Russia-inflicted losses did not.
The same is true of all the aforementioned humiliations: they are particularly painful because an Asian neighbor, not a distant power, inflicted them.
Such humiliations, as we have seen with China, have a long-lasting impact.
Indeed, they can create an all-consuming desire for vengeance that overwhelms more sober foreign-policy motivations.
That is why, for example, Pakistan’s army is prepared to undermine all other institutions in the country it is sworn to defend, in the name of wounding India.
With nationalism on the rise across Asia, leaders have strong incentives to craft a version of history that advances their cause, and few historical memories are as effective for this purpose as those of traumatic humiliation.
China has mastered this art, but it can be seen elsewhere, too, including in India.
The key is to create a hierarchy of humiliations, according to which those inflicted on one’s own country are regarded as vitally important, and those inflicted on others are diminished, remembered only to reaffirm the status hierarchy.
Yet, as the ongoing dispute in Doka La makes clear, such an approach can create serious risks.
After World War I, when Europe failed to address adequately its legacy of humiliation, the results were catastrophic.
After World War II, however, Europe rose to the challenge, setting the stage for unprecedented regional cooperation.
One hopes that Asia takes a similar tack – before simmering anger over historical humiliations boils over.
Asia’s New Entente
PERTH – US President Donald Trump is arriving in Asia at a moment when the region’s security situation is practically white-hot.
US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, recognizing that the world’s “center of gravity is shifting to the heart of the Indo-Pacific,” called on the region’s democratic powers to pursue “greater engagement and cooperation.”
They – including Trump’s US – should heed that call.
In fact, only an alliance of democracies can ensure the emergence of a strong rules-based order and a stable balance of power in the world’s most economically dynamic region.
In recent years, as Tillerson acknowledged, China has taken “provocative actions,” such as in the South China Sea, that challenge international law and norms.
And this behavior is set to continue, if not escalate.
Last month’s 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China effectively crowned President Xi Jinping – who has spearheaded a more muscular foreign policy, in service of his goal of establishing China as a global superpower – as the country’s emperor.
Just as Germany’s rapid ascent prior to World War I spurred a “triple entente” among France, Russia, and the United Kingdom, China’s increasingly assertive behavior is creating strong impetus for the Asia-Pacific democracies to build a more powerful coalition.
After all, as recent experience in the South China Sea has made clear, no single power can impose sufficient costs on China for its maritime and territorial revisionism, much less compel Chinese leaders to change course.
This is not to say that no country has been able to challenge China.
Just this summer, India stood up to its muscle-flexing neighbor in a ten-week border standoff.
China has been using construction projects to change the status quo on the remote Himalayan plateau of Doklam, just as it has so often done in the South China Sea.
India intervened, stalling China’s building activity.
Had US President Barack Obama’s administration shown similar resolve in the South China Sea, perhaps China would not now be in possession of seven militarized artificial islands there.
In any case, securing a broader shift in China’s foreign policy and stabilizing the Asia-Pacific region’s power dynamics will require more than one country holding the line on any one issue.
A US that is willing to employ new tools, a more confident Japan and India, and an Australia vexed by China’s meddling in its domestic affairs must work together to constrain Chinese behavior.
The good news is that an entente has already begun to emerge among the region’s key democracies.
America’s relationship with India, in particular, has been undergoing what Tillerson called a “profound transformation,” as the two countries become “increasingly global partners with growing strategic convergence.”
The US now holds more joint defense exercises with India than with any other country.
Such cooperation puts the two countries in a strong position to fulfill Tillerson’s vision of serving “as the eastern and western beacons of the Indo-Pacific.”
Engagement with Japan, too, has deepened.
This year’s Malabar exercise – an annual naval exercise in the Indian Ocean involving the US, India, and Japan – was the largest and most complex since it began a quarter-century ago.
Focused on destroying enemy submarines, it involved more than 7,000 personnel from the US alone, and featured for the first time aircraft carriers from all three navies: America’s nuclear-powered USS Nimitz, Japan’s Izumo helicopter carrier, and India’s aircraft carrier INS Vikramaditya.
As Tillerson pointed out, this trilateral engagement among the US, India, and Japan is already bringing important benefits.
But “there is room to invite others, including Australia, to build on the shared objectives and initiatives.”
So far, Australia has sought to avoid having to choose between its security ally, the US, and its main economic partner, China.
Despite Defense Minister Marise Payne’s recent declaration that “Australia is very interested in a quadrilateral engagement with India, Japan, and the United States,” the government seems to be hedging its bets.
For example, while it sought this year to rejoin the Malabar exercise – from which it withdrew a decade ago to appease China – it sought to do so only as an “observer.”
This approach is untenable.
If Australia is to free itself of Chinese meddling, it will need to go beyond implementing new domestic safeguards to take a more active role in defending rules and norms beyond its borders, both on land and at sea.
In the coming years, the Indo-Pacific power balance will be determined, first and foremost, by events in the Indian Ocean and East Asia.
Containing China will therefore require, first, efforts to restrict the country’s maritime activities – such as measures to safeguard vital sea lines and build maritime domain awareness – and, second, geo-economic initiatives to counter China’s coercive leverage over smaller countries.
All of Asia’s democratic powers must be on board.
Calls by the US for closer cooperation bode well for this process, though the US still needs to focus more on the globally ascendant and aggressive China than on a declining Russia.
The overwhelming victory of Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe – who has touted the idea of establishing a “democratic security diamond” in the Asia-Pacific – in his country’s recent general election is also likely to help to drive cooperation forward.
To be sure, any entente among Asian democracies is unlikely to take the shape of a formal alliance.
Rather, the objective should be for democratic powers to reach a broad strategic understanding, based on shared values.
It is those values, after all, that set them apart: as Tillerson recognized, while Trump’s upcoming visit to Beijing will undoubtedly draw much global attention, the US cannot have the kind of relationship with non-democratic China that it can have with a major democracy.
By pursuing cooperation, the Indo-Pacific’s democratic powers can shore up an inclusive, rules-based order that underpins peace, prosperity, stability, and freedom of navigation in the region.
That is the only way to thwart China’s effort to establish itself as the hegemon of an illiberal regional order.
Maintaining Growth in a Fast-Aging Asia
SINGAPORE – Asia has been the world champion of economic growth for decades, and this year will be no exception.
According to the latest International Monetary Fund Regional Economic Outlook (REO), the Asia-Pacific region’s GDP is projected to increase by 5.5% in 2017 and 5.4% in 2018.
Despite escalating geopolitical tensions, most countries in the region have maintained their economic momentum.
They have benefited from policies supporting strong domestic demand in China and Japan, and from favorable global conditions.
Growth is picking up across many advanced and emerging market economies, and financial markets have, for the most part, proven to be resilient.
Nonetheless, Asia will still have to confront fundamental medium- and long-term challenges, not least the aging of its population – a problem that is well known to most policymakers.
In past decades, the region reaped a demographic dividend from its young, expanding workforce and strong growth policies.
But this dividend has already run out for “old” countries such as Japan and China.
With fertility rates declining and people living longer, the workforce is shrinking and getting older at the same time.
To be sure, not all Asian countries are aging at the same rate.
In China, Japan, Korea, and Thailand, these demographic trends could subtract anywhere from 0.5 to a full percentage point from annual growth over the next three decades.
But in “young” countries such as India, Indonesia, and the Philippines, the working-age population will actually increase, adding from 1-1.5 percentage points to average annual growth over the same period.
And yet, even these young countries will not be spared from the effects of an aging population.
In this year’s Asia-Pacific REO, we point out a little known fact: almost all of Asia is at risk of growing old before ever becoming rich.
Why is this occurring?
For starters, although Asia is not the most aged region in the world today, it is aging remarkably fast.
One indicator of this is the old-age dependency ratio: the share of the population that is 65 and older.
In Europe, it took 26 years, on average, for this ratio to increase from 15% to 20%; in the United States, it took more than 50 years.
Among Asian countries, only Australia and New Zealand aged at similar speeds.
In most other countries in the region, this transition took – or will take – less than 15 years.
So, being the world growth champion simply isn’t enough.
To see why, consider each country’s per capita income (in terms of purchasing power parity) when its old-age dependency ratio, benchmarked against the US experience, peaked or will peak.
As the chart above shows, with the exception of already-rich Asian economies such as Australia, Hong Kong, Japan, and Singapore, per capita income in Asian economies falls, or will fall, far short of other advanced economies at similar stages of the aging cycle.
For example, when China reached its old-age-population peak in 2011, its per capita income was still only at 20% of the US level; and when Vietnam reached it in 2014, that figure was just 10%.
And despite its young population and strong growth, India’s per capita income will only have reached 45% of the US level when its old-age population peaks in or around 2040; and that assumes, optimistically, that India will maintain very strong growth over the next few decades.
This demographic trend has far-reaching implications for the region.
Asian countries will have significantly less time than advanced economies have had to prepare for the transition to an aged society.
Worse, they will have to manage the high fiscal costs of aging while they are still relatively poor, which will create new social pressures, which are already apparent in the “old” Asian countries.
Moreover, slowing productivity growth could compound Asia’s demographic problem.
Since the 2008 financial crisis, productivity growth has decelerated in Asia’s advanced economies and, to a lesser extent, in its emerging economies, too.
Thus, the region’s push to catch up with countries at the global technology frontier has stalled over the past decade.
To boost productivity in the future, Asian governments will have to implement well-targeted structural reforms today.
Considering Asia’s rapidly aging population, it is crucial that such reforms include policies to protect the elderly, enhance social safety nets, and drive long-term growth.
Governments will also need to make it easier for women and older workers to participate in the labor force, by expanding child-care facilities and creating incentives for firms to relax their retirement-age requirements.
As Australia, Hong Kong, New Zealand, and Singapore have shown, immigration can soften the blow from rapid aging.
And by strengthening pension systems, including through minimum guaranteed benefits, governments can provide a safety net for the vulnerable elderly and reduce incentives for precautionary savings.
These policies should be supplemented by productivity-enhancing reforms.
Different countries will have different priorities, but all will need to make larger investments in education and life-long training, while pressing ahead with labor- and product-market reforms.
Finally, advanced Asian economies should focus on improving innovation, by allocating research and development spending more effectively, and by raising productivity in the services sector.
Emerging and developing countries, for their part, will need to attract more foreign direct investment, boost domestic investment, and expand their capacity to adopt new technologies.
Playing by the Rules in Asia
CANBERRA – China’s adventurism in the South China Sea has prompted a change in Australian policymaking that merits wide international attention.
In making maintenance of a “rules-based global order” a core strategic priority, Australia’s new Defense White Paper adopts language not often found at the heart of national defense charters.
It is all the more surprising coming from a conservative government that is usually keen to follow the United States down any path it takes.
Australia wanted a readily defensible basis for contesting China’s claims that could not be portrayed as just another reflexive embrace of the American position.
For a country trying – as are others in the region – to avoid zero-sum choices between our strategic partner, the US, and our economic partner, China, the White Paper’s words were astutely chosen and deserve emulation.
Part of the attraction of a “rules-based global order” is that it would constrain all relevant players.
US policymakers, unlike those in most of the rest of the world, don’t find the concept inherently attractive.
Although they – like everyone else – do pay lip service to it, willingness to be bound by international rules is not part of US officials’ DNA.
The invasion of Iraq in 2003 remains Exhibit A. But there are others, including the overreach (alongside the United Kingdom and France) of the UN Security Council’s mandate in Libya in 2011, and what Jessica Mathews has described as the “wasteland for multilateral commitments” in the US approach to binding treaties, including the Convention on Biodiversity, the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, the Protocol on Torture, and, most relevant to the South China Sea, the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).
The more immediate sting in the Australian White Paper is for China.
Whatever else is going on in the South China Sea, it is not respect for a rules-based global order.
Playing by the rules would imply a number of changes to Chinese behavior.
First, it would mean clearly articulating specific sovereignty claims, based on long use or occupancy of particular habitable islands, in the Paracel or Spratly groups or elsewhere.
When those claims overlap with claims by other states, as most of them do, China must be prepared to resolve them, preferably by international adjudication or arbitration, which it has so far strongly resisted, or at the very least by genuine give-and-take negotiation.
Second, China would have to abandon its “nine-dash line” as a basis not only for sovereignty claims relating to land features bounded by it, but also for claims to ill-defined “historical waters” or “traditional Chinese fishing grounds.”
With Chinese fishing vessels constantly intruding into what have hitherto been others’ undisputed 200-nautical-mile exclusive economic zones (EEZs) under UNCLOS, these claims are now causing real friction with countries like Indonesia.
UNCLOS – now generally accepted as customary international law even by countries that have not joined it, like the US – is the only acceptable framework for resolving these issues.
Even if every one of China’s current sovereignty claims to particular habitable islands were to be accepted, the 12 nautical miles of territorial waters, and the 200 nautical miles of EEZ associated with each of them, would not begin to add up to the 80% of the South China Sea now encompassed by China’s nine-dash line.
Third, China would need to limit severely its actions relating to reefs and shoals, never previously habitable, where it has been reclaiming land and building airstrips and other installations capable of military use, and seeking to deny others’ the use of adjacent waters and airspace.
International law tolerates some such building – as the Philippines, Vietnam, and Malaysia have been doing for years, though on a much smaller scale.
But it does not tolerate any military use, or support more than a 500-meter “safety zone” around such installations – not a territorial sea, EEZ, “air defense identification zone,” or anything else.
Fourth, China should moderate its position that no foreign ship or aircraft may engage in surveillance or intelligence collection not only within its territorial waters, about which international law is clear, but within its entire EEZ, about which China’s argument is not at all strong.
Adherence to this position sustains a constant risk of inflammatory incidents.
So long as China refuses to play by accepted international rules, others are entitled to push back, including with the fly-by or “freedom of navigation” sail-by exercises in which the US has been engaging, and which Australia and others should separately emulate.
China’s insistence that it has no intention to disrupt commercial shipping or flight lanes should be believed; to do otherwise would be to cut off its nose to spite its face.
But its behavior is testing the limits of regional and global understanding and patience.
The remaining attraction of making a “rules-based global order” central to Australia’s policy is the discipline this imposes on Australia itself – as it would on any state that adopts this language.
To be taken seriously, we have to put our money where our mouths are, by accepting international duties and responsibilities – like helping to stop atrocity crimes in faraway places – that are consistent with our claims to good international citizenship but serve no immediate traditional national security or economic interest.
In Australia’s case, this means thinking again about some of our efforts to limit our exposure to the International Court of Justice and certain dispute-resolution mechanisms under UNCLOS.
In this imperfect world, there is considerable tolerance for all sorts of imperfect behavior.
But hypocrisy always catches up with you.
Preaching the virtues of a rule-based order to others, but being coy about some of those rules oneself, is not a good look.
Rage Against the Machine?
BERKELEY – Intelligent machines are transforming the way we produce, work, learn, and live throughout the world.
Almost every aspect of our economies will be radically altered.
Major logistics companies and individual drivers are using new technologies to optimize their route planning.
Companies like BMW and Tesla have already released self-driving features in their automobiles, which are produced with the help of sophisticated robots.
The Associated Press is using artificial intelligence to help write news stories.
3D printers are being used to produce replacement parts – for both machines and humans.
AT&T, in collaboration with Udacity, is offering online “nanodegrees” in data analytics.
Drones are delivering health supplies to remote locations in poor countries.
These marvelous new technologies promise higher productivity, greater efficiency, and more safety, flexibility, and convenience.
But they are also stoking fears about their effects on jobs, skills, and wages.
Feeding these fears is a recent study by the University of Oxford’s Carl Frey and Michael Osborne, and another by the McKinsey Global Institute (MGI), which find that large shares of employment in both developing and developed countries could technically be automated.
History and economic theory, however, suggest that anxieties about technological unemployment, a term coined by John Maynard Keynes nearly a century ago, are misplaced.
In the future, as in the past, technological change is likely to fuel productivity gains and income growth, boosting demand for labor.
Add to that lower prices and rising quality, and demand for goods and services will also increase.
Many of the jobs created cannot even be imagined today, just as few people a century ago could have anticipated that automobiles would give rise to drive-through restaurants and roadside motels.
A new MGI report finds that under a moderate scenario for the speed and breadth of automation, about 15% of the global workforce, or 400 million workers, could be displaced between now and 2030.
A faster pace of automation would trigger greater displacement.
The good news is that as a result of projected increases in demand for goods and services – driven primarily by rising incomes, the growing health-care needs of aging populations, and investment in infrastructure, energy efficiency, and renewables – enough new jobs are likely to be created to offset job losses.
But the new jobs will differ mightily from the jobs displaced by automation, imposing painful transition costs on workers, businesses, and communities.
Depending on the pace of automation, 75-375 million workers, or 3-14% of the global workforce, will need to change occupational categories by 2030.
In the United States and other developed economies where automation is likely to occur more rapidly, 9-32% of the workforce may need to change occupational categories and the skills associated with them.
In these countries, jobs in major occupational categories like production and office support, and jobs requiring a high school education or less, are likely to decline, while jobs in occupational categories like health and care provision, education, construction, and management, and jobs requiring a college or advanced degree, will increase.
According to one recent survey, the majority of Americans are concerned that automation will increase income inequality.
Their concern appears warranted.
As many middle-wage occupations succumb to automation, income polarization in the US and other developed countries is likely to continue.
If workers displaced by automation are unable to find new jobs quickly, frictional unemployment will rise, putting downward pressure on wages.
So, what can be done to speed and ease the occupational transitions that automation will compel?
For starters, fiscal and monetary policies to sustain full-employment levels of aggregate demand are critical.
Policies to promote investment in infrastructure, housing, alternative energy, and care for the young and the aging can boost economic competitiveness and inclusive growth, while creating millions of jobs in occupations likely to be augmented, rather than displaced, by automation.
A second response must be a dramatic expansion and redesign of workforce training programs.
Over the past two decades, government outlays for skills training and labor-market adjustment have fallen in most OECD countries.
That has been compounded in the US by a sizeable decline in business spending on training as well.
These trends must be reversed.
Lifelong learning needs to become a reality.
Jobs will change as machines take over some tasks, and human activities will require different skills.
MGI’s analysis shows that higher-level cognitive abilities – such as logical reasoning, stronger communication skills, and enhanced social and emotional skills – will become more important, while machines take over routine capabilities common in the workplace today, including in cognitive tasks like data collection and processing.
For mid-career workers with children, mortgages, and other financial responsibilities, training that is measured in weeks and months, not in years, will be necessary, as will financial support to undertake such training.
Sending people for two-year degrees at their own expense is not the answer.
Instead, nanodegrees and stackable credentials are likely to gain in importance.
German-style apprenticeships combining classroom work and practical work, and enabling participants to earn a salary while learning, could be important solutions even for middle-aged displaced workers.
Collaboration between companies and educational institutions, as AT&T (on whose board one of the authors serves), Starbucks, and other firms are showing, can provide workers with the new or enhanced skills that are increasingly needed.
Tax and other incentives to encourage more business investment in workforce training, especially by small and medium-size companies, may be necessary.
Governments will also need to offer universal and portable social benefits like health care, child care, and retirement security, as well as transition support, to workers who are forced to change jobs, occupations, and employers frequently.
Sweden’s job-security councils, run by the private sector and funded by a payroll tax on companies, provide displaced workers with a comprehensive suite of income support, training, coaching, and assessment with caseworkers.
Like previous technologies, automation today promises major productivity gains, benefiting individuals, communities, and societies.
But, for millions of workers, the path to an increasingly automated future could be long and difficult.
It is up to us to make the policy and investment choices that can ease the transition, reduce its costs, and ensure that the income gains are equitably shared.
Racing the Machine
LONDON – Dispelling anxiety about robots has become a major preoccupation of business apologetics.
The commonsense – and far from foolish – view is that the more jobs are automated, the fewer there will be for humans to perform.
The headline example is the driverless car.
If cars can drive themselves, what will happen to chauffeurs, taxi drivers, and so on?
Economic theory tells us that our worries are groundless.
Attaching machines to workers increases their output for each hour they work.
They then have an enviable choice: work less for the same wage as before, or work the same number of hours for more pay.
And as the cost of existing goods falls, consumers will have more money to spend on more of the same goods or different ones.
Either way, there is no reason to expect a net loss of human jobs – or anything but continual improvements in living standards.
History suggests as much.
For the last 200 years or so, productivity has been steadily rising, especially in the West.
The people who live in the West have chosen both more leisure and higher income.
Hours of work in rich countries have halved since 1870, while real per capita income has risen by a factor of five.
How many existing human jobs are actually “at risk” to robots?
According to an invaluable report by the McKinsey Global Institute, about 50% of time spent on human work activities in the global economy could theoretically be automated today, though current trends suggest a maximum of 30% by 2030, depending mainly on the speed of adoption of new technology.
The report’s midpoint predictions are: Germany, 24%; Japan, 26%; the United States, 23%; China, 16%; India, 9%; and Mexico, 13%.
By 2030, MGI estimates, 400-800 million individuals will need to find new occupations, some of which don’t yet exist.
This rate of job displacement is not far out of line with previous periods.
One reason why automation is so frightening today is that the future was more unknowable in the past: we lacked the data for alarmist forecasts.
The more profound reason is that current automation prospects herald a future in which machines can plausibly replace humans in many spheres of work where it was thought that only we could do the job.
Economists have always believed that previous waves of job destruction led to an equilibrium between supply and demand in the labor market at a higher level of both employment and earnings.
But if robots can actually replace, not just displace, humans, it is hard to see an equilibrium point until the human race itself becomes redundant.
The MGI report rejects such a gloomy conclusion.
In the long run, the economy can adjust to provide satisfying work for everyone who wants it.
“For society as a whole, machines can take on work that is routine, dangerous, or dirty, and may allow us to use our intrinsically human talents more fully and enjoy more leisure.”
This is about as good as it gets in business economics.
Yet there are some serious gaps in the argument.
The first concerns the length and scope of the transition from the human to the automated economy.
Here, the past may be a less reliable guide than we think, because the slower pace of technological change meant that job replacement kept up with job displacement.
Today, displacement – and thus disruption – will be much faster, because technology is being invented and diffused much faster.
“In advanced economies, all scenarios,” McKinsey writes, “result in full employment by 2030, but transition may include periods of higher unemployment and [downward] wage adjustments,” depending on the speed of adaptation.
This poses a dilemma for policymakers.
The faster the new technology is introduced, the more jobs it eats up, but the quicker its promised benefits are realized.
The MGI report rejects attempts to limit the scope and pace of automation, which would “curtail the contributions that these technologies make to business dynamism and economic growth.”
Given this priority, the main policy response follows automatically: massive investment, on a “Marshall Plan scale,” in education and workforce training to ensure that humans are taught the critical skills to enable them to cope with the transition.
The report also recognizes the need to ensure that “wages are linked to rising productivity, so that prosperity is shared with all.”
But it ignores the fact that recent productivity gains have overwhelmingly benefited a small minority.
Consequently, it pays scant attention to how the choice between work and leisure promised by economists can be made effective for all.
Finally, there is the assumption running through the report that automation is not just desirable, but irreversible.
Once we have learned to do something more efficiently (at lower cost), there is no possibility of going back to doing it less efficiently.
The only question left is how humans can best adapt to the demands of a higher standard of efficiency.
Philosophically, this is confused, because it conflates doing something more efficiently with doing it better.
It mixes up a technical argument with a moral one.
Of the world promised us by the apostles of technology, it is both possible and necessary to ask: Is it good?
Is a world in which we are condemned to race with machines to produce ever-larger quantities of consumption goods a world worth having?
And if we cannot hope to control this world, what is the value of being human?
These questions may be outside McKinsey remit, but they should not be off limits to public discussion.
Awakening from the Trump Nightmare
PARIS – The American people can escape from the ordeal of Donald Trump’s presidency in one of three ways.
But if and when they do is an irreducibly political question, not one that hinges on legal possibilities.
First, there’s the Nixonian method, in which the president, worn down by the fight, simply resigns, scared and unwilling to submit to the proceedings that he sees mounting around him.
But could that really be the exit taken by Trump?
Does he share with his distant Republican predecessor a strong enough predisposition to melancholy?
Can one picture a childish man, compulsive and narcissistic, surrendering without a fight the larger-than-life toy that is the top job in the most powerful country on the planet?
I doubt it.
Second, there is Article 4 of the 25th Amendment to the Constitution, ratified in 1967, which spells out a process by which the vice president and cabinet can act to replace a president who has died or is prevented by reasons of health from governing.
Such might have been the case, four years earlier, following the assassination of John F. Kennedy, had Kennedy not died from his wounds.
The possibility briefly resurfaced when President Ronald Reagan began to show the first signs of Alzheimer’s disease.
But the current situation does not resemble those cases.
Trump may be unstable and unfit to govern, as his detractors claim.
But is he any more so now than he was when the American people elected him?
Probably not.
Finally, there remains the remedy of impeachment, which is being discussed more and more openly in Washington these days, accompanied (in a sign of the times) by a book, The Case for Impeachment, by Allan J. Lichtman.
(A political historian, Lichtman is famous for having devised a model that has enabled him to predict the election of every American president from Ronald Reagan to Donald Trump.)
Impeachment, set out in Article 2 of the Constitution, is a procedure for the removal from office of a president, vice president, or other top executive official (or judge) suspected of “treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.”
It is a complex process that unfolds in two phases: first, the House of Representatives must decide, by a simple majority, that the charges are serious enough to be tried; second, a full-fledged trial is conducted in the Senate, which must reach a two-thirds majority to convict the official and trigger immediate removal from office.
There are two main reasons to doubt that impeachment would rid the world of Trump.
First, there is the balance of power in the Senate.
At least 19 Republican senators would have to join the Democrats to convict Trump.
At the moment, at most five can be counted on to do so.
The only two presidential precedents (Andrew Johnson, impeached in 1868 for abuse of power, and Bill Clinton, impeached in 1998 for perjury and obstruction of justice) are hardly encouraging: both ended in acquittal by the Senate.
Second, there is the reluctance of Democratic Party bosses to see ultraconservative Vice President Mike Pence assume the place vacated by a fallen Trump.
Wouldn’t he enjoy the same state of grace enjoyed by recent vice presidents who entered the Oval Office under exceptional circumstances (Lyndon Johnson after Kennedy; Gerald Ford after Nixon)?
And what if he remained in office, not only for the remainder of Trump’s term, but for two four-year terms of his own?
All of this is logical enough.
But times have changed since Johnson, Ford, and even Clinton.
In post-modern democracies, there is one and only one boss: public opinion.
And public opinion operates according to its own logic.
How long will the American public tolerate the almost-daily doses of new evidence of conflicts of interest, starting with the licensing to Chinese investors, at the height of the presidential primary, of the Trump brand for use on spas, luxury hotels, and other real-estate projects?
What about Trump’s financial ties with Russia, and those of his associates, including his former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, and his former campaign manager, Paul Manafort?
What leverage can be wielded by the Russian oligarchs who, in 2004, when Trump was mired in one of his bankruptcies, stepped in for the American banks that had blacklisted him to recapitalize his companies and bought – sight unseen and at premium prices – luxury apartments in Trump World Tower?
Won’t all of this eventually take its toll?
And, finally, there is the gross obstruction of justice represented by the firing of FBI director James Comey, whose main offense seems to have been his refusal to exclude Trump from his investigation of the Kremlin’s criminal interference in the 2016 campaign.
What will voters make of the damning revelations that are sure to come to light, now that Comey’s predecessor, Robert Mueller, has been appointed as special counsel to investigate the ties between Russia and Trump’s election campaign?
The signs of public disgust are mounting.
A petition drive to impeach Trump, organized by Massachusetts lawyer John Bonifaz, has gathered more than a million signatures.
Polls indicate that a majority of the electorate would favor Trump’s resignation if it were proved that his campaign colluded with Russia to sway the election.
And growing numbers of voters are now saying as much to their representatives, who, sooner or later, will have to start listening if they want to avoid imperiling their own electoral chances.
For Trump, the real danger will come as the crowd he captivated and captured during the campaign begins to turn on him.
That crowd, as astute political observers from Plato to de Tocqueville amply demonstrated, becomes harder to evade the more you make it master.
The worst case is never inevitable.
May the mob of the populist tide become once again the great American people, a people of citizens.
When that happens, Trump will be history.
Mending Bangladesh’s Garment Industry
KUALA LUMPUR – Four years ago, the deadly collapse of the Rana Plaza garment factory in Bangladesh pulled back the curtain on the employment practices of the global apparel industry.
We had hoped that the tragedy, which killed more than 1,100 workers – the deadliest accident in the industry’s history – would have brought meaningful change to a business long left to its own devices.
Unfortunately, our research suggests the opposite has happened.
Media reports highlight the industry’s ongoing transgressions in Bangladesh, in particular the persistent reliance on child labor.
In 2014, the British current-affairs program Exposure found evidence of children as young as 13 working in factories (often under harsh conditions) producing clothes for retailers in the United Kingdom.
Another undercover report by CBS News interviewed a 12-year-old girl who obtained a factory job using a certificate that falsified her age.
And journalists from The Australian Women’s Weekly found girls as young as ten stitching clothes for top Australian brands.
While the media reports are troubling, they do not provide the entire picture.
How many minors and adolescent girls are employed overall in factory jobs?
More important, should they be barred from such jobs entirely?
Access to factories is restricted, and most employees will not disclose their actual age in the workplace.
Indeed, journalists often mask their identity to document abuses.
We took a different approach to assess the prevalence of underage workers in the garment industry, and to determine the sector’s value to Bangladeshi society.
As part of a recent nationwide census, we collected data from thousands of mothers and girls in Bangladesh’s three industrial districts with the highest concentration of ready-made garment factories (particularly those operating outside the Export Processing Zones): Ashulia, Gazipur, and Narayanganj.
The majority of the country’s female garment workers are concentrated in these areas.
For comparison, we also carried out interviews in 58 urban areas where garment factories are not located.
During our research, we identified 3,367 women and girls in the survey areas who reported being employed in the apparel industry.
Of them, 3% were between the ages of ten and 13, and 11% were 14-17 years old.
Of the 861 girls below the age of 18 who were engaged in any kind of work, 28% said they worked in the garment industry.
Based on this evidence, it would appear that Bangladesh’s garment factories are using child labor (particularly that of young girls) more pervasively than even the most sensational media reports suggest.
But for us, the real question is whether this practice should be eradicated or reformed.
Global brands relying on cheap labor have promised eradication.
In 1992, about 10% of the garment sector’s workforce was below the age of 14.
The following year, after the introduction of the Child Labor Deterrence Act in the United States – the so-called Harkin Bill, which barred US imports of products made with child labor – some 50,000 underage workers were removed from the factory floor.
Meanwhile, the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association has pledged to phase out child labor and put children back in school – female school enrollment is typically lower in areas of high garment-industry employment than in other areas – upholding a 2010 law prohibiting employment of children under 14.
Clearly, our data suggest that the industry’s promises have yet to be fulfilled (though the government of Bangladesh claims that there currently is “no child labor” in garment processing units).
But that may not be entirely bad for underage female workers in Bangladesh.
Thanks to pressure on garment manufacturers in the wake of the Rana Plaza disaster, the industry’s minimum wage was increased 77%, to $68 a month.
This has made it more attractive for young girls to take up paid employment in the sector, which, paradoxically, does have some social benefit.
The majority of young girls who are working in Bangladesh are from poor families.
Even in garment manufacturing areas, relatively better-off families rarely send their daughters to work in factories.
Although recent initiatives have lowered the cost of schooling for girls (through cash stipends and the elimination of school fees), many young women still drop out of secondary school, even without the opportunity to engage in paid work.
That often leaves girls with one option: marriage.
And in a country where minimum marriage-age laws are rarely implemented, earning a paycheck is the best way to avoid a premature wedding day.
In such a situation, when many young girls must choose between factory work and marrying young, banning factory employment for girls under 18 would do more harm than good.
To help young girls avoid this choice, and to reduce the presence of minors and young girls in factories, requires greater emphasis on poverty reduction in rural areas.
Bangladesh’s garment industry is expected to quadruple in size over the next two decades, attracting millions more female workers, young and old, to the production floor.
According to our estimates, one of every ten of these new employees will be between 10-17 years of age.
Consumers around the world reject clothing stitched by child labor, which is commendable.
Children under 18 should be in school and learning important life skills, not working long hours under difficult conditions.
But the lessons from the 2013 tragedy at Rana Plaza are more complicated than much of the international media make them out to be.
The garment industry does need to reform; but, for the time being, if women and girls are not to suffer needlessly again, promising to eradicate child labor may not be the right answer.
Don’t Bank on Bankruptcy for Banks
CAMBRIDGE – In the next month, the US Treasury Department is expected to decide whether to seek to replace the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act’s regulator-led process for resolving failed mega-banks with a solely court-based mechanism.
Such a change would be a mistake of potentially crisis-size proportions.
Yes, creating a more streamlined bankruptcy process can reduce the decibel level of a bank’s failure, and bankruptcy judges are experts at important restructuring tasks.
But there are critical factors that cannot be ignored.
Restructuring a mega-bank requires pre-planning, familiarity with the bank’s strengths and weaknesses, knowledge of how to time the bankruptcy properly in a volatile economy, and the capacity to coordinate with foreign regulators.
The courts cannot fulfill these tasks alone, especially in the time the proposal under consideration has allotted – a 48-hour weekend.
Unable to plan ahead, the courts would enter into the restructuring process unfamiliar with the bank.
Moreover, the courts cannot manage the kind of economy-wide crisis that would arise if multiple mega-banks sank simultaneously.
And they cannot coordinate with foreign regulators.
In short, completing a proper restructuring would require contributions from regulators, including pre-planning, advice, and coordination.
Yet, far from accepting these contributions, the plan would largely cut regulators out of the process.
For example, the plan would bar regulators from initiating a mega-bank’s bankruptcy, leaving it to the discretion of the bank’s own managers.
In the nonfinancial sector, failing companies often wait too long before declaring bankruptcy, so creditors may step in to do some pushing, potentially even forcing a bankruptcy of a failed firm.
While bank regulators have tools to push banks similarly, their most effective one is the power to initiate a bankruptcy when it is best for the economy.
Taking this tool away could have severe adverse consequences.
Bank executives, like sinking industrial firm executives, have reason to “pray and delay,” hoping that some new development will save them.
But if a failing mega-bank runs out of cash during such a delay, the risk that its bankruptcy will be disorderly – as with Lehman Brothers in 2008 – rises, as does the potential that it will wreak havoc on the real economy.
The simple fact is that government regulators can do things that courts cannot.
Courts lack the staff and expertise to come up with a nation-wide recovery plan.
Moreover, they cannot lend to a cash-poor wobbly bank until it can stand on its own.
The government can do that – and it can make sure that either the bank will repay the loans (by getting good collateral) or that the financial sector overall will cover the repayment (as Dodd-Frank authorized and required).
When courts preside over nonfinancial bankruptcies, they depend on private lenders to provide emergency liquidity.
But in a financial crisis, weakened banks cannot lend, meaning that the government must serve as the lender of last resort.
And to play that role well, the government must be deeply involved in the bankruptcy process, so that it can jump in if needed.
The current proposal, which the US House of Representatives has already passed, has other major flaws.
For starters, American mega-banks operate worldwide, typically with a significant presence in London and other financial centers.
If creditors and depositors of a failed American mega-bank’s foreign affiliate run off with the cash they held there, or if a foreign regulator shuts down that affiliate, the US bank would be in an untenable position.
Yet courts cannot negotiate understandings with foreign regulators.
American regulators can, but only if they can control the timing of the bankruptcy, and otherwise engage in the process.
To be sure, the bankruptcy bill now in play is useful.
But it is not robust.
It would not allow broad-spectrum, full-scale bankruptcies, in which failing operations are closed under the court’s aegis, viable operations are sold, and debts are restructured up and down a company’s balance sheet.
Rather, the current proposal envisages a limited-scale weekend restructuring, requiring that a precise loan structure be put in place years ahead of time.
The bank would be closed on Friday evening, unburdened of pre-positioned evaporating debts over the weekend, and reopened on Monday morning, without (in the best-case scenario) needing a government bailout.
If successful, this kind of rapid-fire bankruptcy process would be valuable.
But it has never been tried.
To have any chance of re-opening on Monday morning, a bankrupt bank’s billions of dollars in long-term debt would already have to be structured in such a way that a bankruptcy court could eliminate it over a weekend.
But bankruptcy judges would have no knowledge in advance of a bank’s debt, and they would need more than a weekend to determine whether that debt could be properly stripped out.
Government regulators, on the other hand, could do this in advance.
And yet, under the current proposal, their official means of doing so would be sharply rolled back.
Bankruptcy, if it works, is a good way for a failing firm to restructure or shrink.
But if a failing mega-bank cannot open on Monday morning, the financial system will need backup.
Under the current proposal, the absence of a regulatory safety net could result, if the weekend restructuring fails, in a global chaotic free-for-all, just like the one that followed the 2008 Lehman Brothers bankruptcy.
Maintaining financial stability in a crisis is too important for us to pin our hopes on a narrow bankruptcy channel.
The courts can help, especially after they have developed a routinized process for restructuring banks, as they have done with airline restructurings.
But we should be wary about relying on courts to do things they have never been asked to do before.
The House already voted, precipitously, to replace the regulator-led restructuring system with a weaker court-led setup.
Let’s hope that wiser heads at the Treasury Department prevail.
A letter to Congress with a similar conclusion was signed by 120 academics with expertise in bankruptcy, banking regulation, finance, or all three.
The Last Basel Round?
LONDON – After long and sometimes painful negotiations, which stress-tested the personal relationships between many countries’ central bankers and regulators to the limit, the Basel Committee laid a long-expected egg in December.
Described as a package that finalizes the post-2008 reforms to the global regime for bank capital, it brings to an end the process known as Basel 3.
Bankers have dubbed the result “Basel 4,” arguing that the final package contains many new and more burdensome requirements.
But the Committee is adamant that the new rules should be regarded as part and parcel of the reform program begun in 2009, in the wake of the global financial crisis. Basel 4 may come one day, but this is not it, they insist.
What problem does the new package seek to resolve?
In the preamble, the regulators refer to “a worrying degree of variability in banks’ calculations of [risk-weighted assets].”
They have found that applying the major banks’ different internal models to the same portfolio of loans can produce very different numbers, meaning that some banks would be carrying significantly less capital than others for the same quantum of assumed risk.
The logical answer to that problem, one might think, is to interrogate the models closely, to see what is driving the differences, and demand calibration changes where the resultant asset reductions are deemed excessive.
But the regulators clearly doubt their capacity to penetrate the dark recesses of banks’ internal models; so, instead, they have imposed a so-called “output floor.”
In other words, however much your model reduces risk-weighted assets, you cannot take credit for more than a 27.5% cut.
The output floor is expressed as a net figure, of 72.5%, below which you cannot go.
Why the unusually precise figure of 72.5%?
The answer is obvious.
It is half way between 75%, which was the final US bid, and 70%, which was the French offer. They agreed to split the difference.
Although this may make no sense, even affected banks had come to the view that some kind of agreement was better than none.
Continuing uncertainty made capital planning very difficult. So bankers favored a deal, and will live with the outcome, if it is genuinely the end of the program.
Unfortunately, this new agreement is unlikely to draw a line under the capital debate.
Even though senior central bankers like Mark Carney, the Governor of the Bank of England and Chair of the Financial Stability Board, think there is now enough capital in the banking system, many do not share his view.
Anat Admati of Stanford would like capital ratios well above 20%.
Martin Wolf of the Financial Times makes a similar case. He thinks banks are still dangerously unstable.
Andy Haldane of the Bank of England points out that, given the low pricing of bank equity, on a market-adjusted basis banks are not as strong as they seem.
Bankers, by contrast, point to the high cost of equity and argue that forcing banks to raise even more will increase the cost and decrease the availability of credit.
In Europe, around half of the improvement in capital ratios has come from reducing lending rather than raising new equity.
There is little meeting of minds between the two camps.
So it was a relief to encounter William Cline’s book The Right Balance for Banks, which attempts to produce a rationale for the appropriate level of bank capital.
Drawing on a wide range of research and market analysis, Cline argues that requiring banks to hold more capital does indeed increase the cost of credit to some extent.
Although there is some evidence that bank debt is cheaper if equity backing is high, which one would expect, the reduction is not one for one.
And an increase in the cost of credit is likely to depress growth and generate welfare losses.
On the other hand, higher equity for banks will reduce the incidence of bank failures, which impose high costs on the economy and on individuals.
Reducing the number and severity of crises is evidently desirable.
So Cline attempts to calculate where the optimal balance might lie, recognizing that to reduce the risk of bank failure to zero might carry irrationally high costs.
Cline’s conclusion is that “the optimal capital ratio is 7% to 8% of total assets, corresponding to 12% to 14% of risk-weighted assets (using the ratio of risk-weighted assets to total assets in euro area and US banks).”
These figures are, in fact, quite close to the numbers underlying the new Basel requirements as implemented by national regulators.
Most British banks, for example, are now targeting a requirement of 13%, and typically carry a bit more “for luck.”
Cline’s approach is intuitively appealing.
He recognizes that the ratio might reasonably be shaded up for systemically important banks, those famously dubbed “too big to fail.”
In the regulatory school where I was trained – the Bank of England – we were told never to use that fatal phrase, for fear of generating precisely the moral hazard we wished to avoid.
But there is no getting away from it in the post-crisis world.
Will Cline’s hard work end the debate?
I doubt it.
Even now, I hear axes being ground, and statistical models being recalculated.
And there are still no votes in taking the pressure off big banks.
The central bankers will need to hold their nerve, and the bankers themselves to behave, or a genuine Basel 4 may hove into view on the banks of the Rhine.
The Pie-in-the-Sky UBI
BERKELEY – According to the conventional wisdom in Silicon Valley, robots will soon eat everyone’s job, and a universal basic income will become necessary.
Lately, tech titans are especially eager to extol the results of a UBI pilot project in Kenya that is being funded largely by Silicon Valley philanthropists.
While the idea of UBI often arises during periods of economic and social stress, this is the first true test of it.
The Kenya project provides a guaranteed poverty-ending income for those who receive it.
In 40 poor, remote villages, 6,000 adults are now receiving 75 cents (yes, cents) per day – or $22 per month for 12 years.
We hope that the experiment in Kenya works.
Cash assistance shows much promise for eliminating extreme poverty in developing countries.
But, to be effective, it must be delivered directly to those in need over a sustained period of time, and in adequate amounts.
In poor developing countries, a UBI can disintermediate expensive aid programs that fail to address the targeted population’s needs, and that are often undermined by corrupt regimes.
Still, Silicon Valley’s titans should curb their enthusiasm.
The Kenya UBI relies on M-Pesa, a for-profit mobile banking system that was built with the support of foreign aid, private companies, and a forward-looking government – not well-meaning philanthropists.
And even if a UBI succeeds in Kenya over the next 12 years, it is not a solution to pressing problems in the US economy today.
A UBI for the United States is as fanciful as President Donald Trump’s border wall: it would be prohibitively expensive; and it would not solve the problems that it is meant to address.
Worst of all, UBI proposals are disingenuous distractions from such immediate problems as persistent poverty, especially for children and racial and ethnic minorities; stagnant real (inflation-adjusted) wages and incomes for most households; expanding income inequality; declining social mobility; inequalities in educational opportunities; and the income volatility that comes with erratic employment.
Technology has not yet significantly reduced the overall number of jobs in the US, but it has certainly undermined job quality for millions of workers.
New technologies are wiping out routine manual and cognitive middle-skill jobs, and exacerbating labor-income inequalities, the most important source of overall income inequalities.
But does this litany of problems justify a basic income for every working American, including Silicon Valley “superstars,” whose skills and incomes have been complemented and enhanced by skill-biased, labor-saving technological change?
Even if a UBI for every American adult was a desirable goal, no serious proposal for funding it exists.
In Kenya, a $22 monthly payment might very well eradicate poverty; but it would be “chump change” in the US, where the official poverty line for an adult in 2016 was $12,700 per year.
Each year, a $10,000 basic income for every American adult would cost more than $3 trillion, consuming more than three-quarters of the annual federal budget.
This would require historically high taxes, and yet we rarely hear wealthy UBI advocates calling for their taxes to be raised.
They are more likely to advocate cutting existing social-welfare spending, such as Social Security and other programs that benefit the bottom two-fifths of the population, including children.
While we await the results of the Kenyan UBI pilot and anticipate the future destruction of jobs by intelligent robots, we need to modernize and strengthen existing programs that address the challenges workers face today.
Quality education at all levels, including job-relevant training and lifelong learning opportunities, are critical to provide the skills that labor markets demand, but require significant investment.
Transition-assistance programs, to help workers and their families cope with employment and income disruptions, also will be needed.
In Silicon Valley, “disruption” connotes positive change; in reality, disruption inflicts substantial pain on those whose livelihoods are upended by new technology.
In the US, current programs – such as Medicaid, unemployment compensation, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) – should be made more generous.
In addition, the US should develop a national, universal income-insurance program to assist those facing financial insecurity as a result of unemployment, disability, illness, or the death of a family member.
Meanwhile, as a larger share of the workforce engages in independent work, the current employment-based benefits system will need to be replaced with a portable benefits system that covers all workers, regardless of employer.
Americans also need a higher federal minimum wage.
Had the minimum wage kept pace with rising productivity, it would be nearly $19 per hour today, instead of $7.25.
Among workers earning the minimum wage, more than half are women, and many of them depend on tipping for the bulk of their income, as restaurants are permitted to pay a shockingly low minimum wage of $2.13 per hour.
A majority of Americans support raising the minimum wage, as do seven Nobel laureates in economics; one hopes that Silicon Valley’s UBI proselytizers do, too.
Finally, America should start to develop a means-tested income supplement for workers whose jobs are displaced, or whose wages are undercut, by automation.
To that end, the earned-income tax credit should be replaced by a generous negative income tax – an idea that the economist Milton Friedman proposed decades ago, when robots were still the stuff of science fiction.
A negative income tax – which, unlike a UBI, provides a powerful incentive to work – could raise the take-home pay of millions of workers employed in low-wage jobs.
Many of these are “care” and other “personal services” jobs, which are projected to be among the fastest-growing occupations in the next decade – and which robots are unlikely to “disrupt.”
As Teddy Roosevelt said, “Far and away the best prize that life offers is the chance to work hard at work worth doing.”
The focus of policy today should be on worthwhile work that pays a living wage, not starry-eyed proposals for a post-work future.
Data-Driven Gender Equality
NEW YORK – A key agenda item at this year’s annual meeting of the United Nations General Assembly, under way this week, will be to assess global progress on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the UN’s consensus roadmap for solving the world’s biggest challenges by 2030.
I was part of the UN team that helped create the Millennium Development Goals, which preceded the SDGs.
By the time the MDGs concluded in 2015, they had fueled some of the fastest and most extensive gains in global health and development the world has ever seen.
The MDGs paved the way for the SDGs, and I have been encouraged by the commitment the global community has shown to sustaining the post-2015 development agenda.
But it has also become clear to me and others that without a more deliberate, data-driven focus on the needs of women and girls in particular, progress toward a wide range of objectives will suffer.
If we fail to achieve universal gender equality, we will fall short of many other goals, from ending poverty to ensuring good health.
One of my personal frustrations with the MDGs was that gender equality was more a matter of rhetoric than of action.
Despite their promise of empowerment, the MDGs didn’t adequately target many of the biggest challenges that women and girls face, such as gender-based violence and economic discrimination.
These gaps have persisted, because in the 1990s, when the MDGs were being formulated, most people, including me, did not adequately understand the scale or complexity of the problem.
We must avoid a similar fate with the SDGs.
Achieving gender equality is more than a once-in-a-generation opportunity; it is also the best way to make progress on nearly all of the SDGs, and to build a world where everyone can thrive.
As Bill and Melinda Gates will discuss at a gathering of world leaders next week in New York, and show in a new report, collective action is needed to address the various dimensions of gender inequality and drive progress.
One of the biggest impediments is a dearth of good data on issues that disproportionately affect women and girls, such as land rights, access to education, family planning, or health care.
Data are essential to understanding what is working and how to track progress.
Yet up-to-date data exist for only a small fraction of the indicators that were developed to assess progress on the 17 SDGs – including the more than 40 that directly relate to gender equality.
Of the 14 indicators of progress associated with the primary gender equity goal, SDG 5, most countries are measuring just three.
To help fill these critical gaps, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation has created a three-year, $80 million initiative to generate more reliable data that can improve the design and targeting of programs and policy interventions.
As part of that effort, the foundation recently launched a $10 million partnership with UN Women to help countries improve the quality of the gender-specific data they collect.
The foundation is also supporting Equal Measures 2030, an initiative to empower advocates and civil-society groups with easy-to-use evidence to assess progress toward targets and keep the SDGs for women and girls on track.
These and other efforts will provide gender-equality advocates and decision-makers with better information about the nature and scale of the social and economic barriers holding women and girls back, and help identify who is falling through the cracks.
We know from existing evidence that empowering women and girls can accelerate progress.
For example, when girls attend secondary school (SDG 4), they are up to six times less likely to be married as a child.
And higher literacy rates among adolescent girls are associated with lower adolescent birth rates and improved health (SDG 3).
Likewise, women are much more likely than men to invest surplus income in ways that improve the lives of their children.
The benefits of gender equity are also apparent when women have access to basic financial services, like credit and savings accounts, which enable them to start businesses and save money for family essentials.
Closing the gender gap in agriculture, meanwhile, could have an even more profound impact on families and productivity in the developing world.
Today, for example, women make up nearly half of the agricultural workforce in Sub-Saharan Africa.
Yet, they typically work smaller, less productive plots of land than men, and often lack access to the best seeds, fertilizer, credit, and training opportunities.
Studies show that giving women more decision-making power over productive assets has the potential to increase farm yields by more than 20%, which is essential to “end poverty in all its forms everywhere” by 2030 (SDG 1).
When we remove the barriers confronting the most vulnerable in society, the effects are transformational.
But to do that, donors, development partners, governments, and the private sector must invest in more and better data that are sorted by age and sex.
Doing so will allow programs to be tailored to the needs of women and girls everywhere.
Our challenge – and opportunity – is to overcome the deeply entrenched barriers that impede progress for women and girls.
The SDGs are a huge step in that direction.
But goals without actionable strategies are just good intentions.
The SDGs provide the roadmap to ending poverty and creating a better, healthier, more secure world for everyone.
Ensuring that we have quality data is the best way to ensure that no one gets lost along the way.
Seeing Through Big Tobacco’s Smokescreen
GENEVA – We all know how bad tobacco is, that it kills millions of people every year, and that it harms many more.
We also know that tobacco companies have consistently lied about how much damage their products cause.
But now, even Big Tobacco has been forced to state the facts publicly.
After losing a string of appeals following a 2006 US federal court ruling, four companies have been forced to reveal the truth behind years of deceptive marketing, by publishing advertisements containing “corrective statements” in US newspapers and on television.
These public statements acknowledge that the companies – Philip Morris USA, RJ Reynolds Tobacco, Lorillard, and Altria – knew the damage their products cause but kept selling them anyway.
And it is not just courts that are taking action against the tobacco industry.
The recent decision by French bank BNP Paribas to stop financing and investing in tobacco companies – including producers, wholesalers, and traders – is just the latest sign that public health is finally being put ahead of commercial interests.
Still, we must not be lulled into believing that these overdue confessions reflect an industry undergoing altruistic catharsis.
They resulted from the combined pressure of the US justice system, tobacco-control advocates, and the sheer weight of evidence against the industry’s misleading marketing of “light” and “mild” tobacco products.
They should be regarded as a warning: The industry couldn’t be trusted in the past, and it shouldn’t be trusted to do the right thing in the future.
Even today, the same tobacco companies are marketing new products that they claim are less harmful – like “heat-not-burn” devices, which vaporize tobacco to produce a nicotine-containing aerosol – and funding front groups purporting to work for a smoke-free world.
The world has witnessed similar tactics elsewhere, from Uruguay to Australia, where tobacco companies launch costly legal challenges against legitimate regulation of its deadly products.
Despite such losses, it will no doubt continue looking for new ways to oppose tobacco restrictions.
To be sure, the court-ordered airing of “corrective statements” in American media does represent a victory for truth.
It brings closure to an important US Justice Department lawsuit, filed in 1999 under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, and then left partly unresolved, until October 2017, during a decade of appeals and legal wrangling following the 2006 decision.
The statements detail the deadly health effects of smoking and second-hand smoke, including the fact that low-tar and “light” cigarettes are no less harmful than regular ones; that smoking and nicotine are highly addictive; and that cigarettes are “intentionally” manipulated to “maximize the ingestion of nicotine.”
Even cigarette manufacturers admit that their products contribute to 1,200 US deaths each day.
Around the world, tobacco use kills more than seven million people annually.
Enough is enough; at this critical moment, we must not let the momentum slip.
Governments and health organizations like ours are at war with the tobacco industry, and we will continue fighting until we beat Big Tobacco.
If national leaders, health ministers, and finance chiefs ever wondered how far they should go to regulate tobacco products, Big Tobacco’s admissions, together with investors’ second thoughts, have provided an answer: as far as necessary.
Governments face a moral and legal imperative to use the strongest possible measures to protect their citizens from tobacco.
One way forward would be for more governments to implement commitments enshrined in the World Health Organization’s Framework Convention on Tobacco Control.
The WHO FCTC provides guidelines on topics such as tobacco taxation, public awareness and education, and package warnings.
These measures have helped save millions of lives in the last decade, not to mention hundreds of billions of dollars in health costs.
But more can be done, which is why we are calling on governments around the world to strengthen implementation of the WHO FCTC by accelerating action on the “MPOWER” tobacco control policies – measures intended to strengthen country-level implementation of the WHO FCTC.
Together, these frameworks represent the strongest defense countries have against the tobacco industry.
Moreover, governments should endorse the Protocol to Eliminate the Illicit Trade in Tobacco Products, which aims to prevent illicit trade, such as smuggling.
While 33 countries and the European Union have signed the protocol, it needs the support of seven more governments before it can enter into force.
And, finally, looking ahead to the UN’s High-level Meeting on Non-communicable Diseases in 2018, government leaders must be prepared to demonstrate their commitment to protecting people from heart and lung disease, cancer, and diabetes, by supporting stronger tobacco controls.
With its recent admissions, Big Tobacco has been forced to reveal its true nature.
However reluctantly, these companies have called on all of us to reject their products.
We think it is time to take them up on the offer.
Smoking Out Big Tobacco
BOSTON – Recently, the tobacco industry’s lack of respect for people’s lives, international law, and national sovereignty has been placed under a spotlight.
Investigations carried out by the likes of the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Guardian newspaper have provided damning evidence of what we in the public health community have known for decades: Big Tobacco, in its relentless pursuit of profit, is subverting, blocking, and weakening public health protections in any way it can.
As the investigations showed, corporations like Philip Morris International (PMI) and British American Tobacco have often used covert tactics, outright bullying, and illicit activities to block progress on the WHO’s Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC), established in 2003.
Now, the United Kingdom’s Serious Fraud Office (SFO) has confirmed that it is investigating British American Tobacco for a conspiracy of bribery in Central and East Africa.
That is a start.
But, given the fundamental conflict between the tobacco industry’s interests and public-health objectives, health practitioners and governments around the world must do more to prevent Big Tobacco from interfering in official policy.
Indeed, they must erect an unbreachable firewall between policymaking and the industry at the national and international levels.
This idea is embedded in Article 5.3 of the FCTC.
The need for that provision was made apparent by internal tobacco-industry documents released through the Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement, reached between the four largest US tobacco corporations and the attorneys general of 46 US states in 1998.
Those documents revealed, for example, that Philip Morris Companies (then the parent of PMI) viewed the WHO as a threat and sought “countermeasures” to “contain/neutralize/re-orient” it.
Recent investigations show that PMI targeted global tobacco treaty meetings, wooing delegates, and stacking delegations with industry-friendly trade ministers.
BAT, for its part, has taken aim at national lawmakers, reportedly bribing officials in parts of East Africa to block or subvert public policy and force its way into the market, in order to get a new generation in Africa addicted to its product.
All of this has resulted in delayed progress in implementing lifesaving public-health protections around the world – though it hasn’t stopped them.
Dozens of governments have already begun to implement measures in line with the global tobacco convention’s conflict-of-interest provisions.
For example, Norway has divested more than $2 billion from the tobacco industry.
The European Union has terminated its controversial agreement with PMI on tackling illicit trade.
And the Philippines has barred public officials from interacting with the tobacco industry unless absolutely necessary.
With such measures, governments are prioritizing people’s health over the industry’s profits.
After all, without Big Tobacco at the table, they are more likely to succeed in implementing measures for reducing smoking rates, whether tried-and-true policies like prohibiting cigarette marketing, or newer measures, such as eliminating branding from cigarette packages.
Taken together, these actions are saving millions of lives.
More countries must urgently implement similar policies.
And to do so, they must ensure that they employ processes and policies that are in line with Article 5.3, thereby preventing the industry from subverting their initiatives to reduce smoking rates and improve public health.
But Big Tobacco is not the only industry attempting to undermine the public good for the sake of its own interests.
That is why international legal frameworks like the FCTC must be developed for other industries that are using Big Tobacco’s playbook to weaken public-health legislation and environmental regulations that affect their own lines.
The good news is that there is increasing awareness of the use of such tactics not just by Big Tobacco, but also by other similarly powerful industries.
At the most recent meeting of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, for example, the fossil-fuel industry’s interference in the talks was a central issue.
Now, calls to prevent powerful industries such as Big Oil, Big Pharma, and Big Food from undermining, diluting, or delaying sound policies that advance the public interest are growing louder.
The recent SFO investigation and media exposés should reinforce this shift, serving as a powerful incentive for governments to implement stronger conflict-of-interest measures – on tobacco and other issues – at the international and national levels.
Today, there are powerful corporations – from the tobacco and pharmaceutical industries to those engaged in water privatization and climate change – bent on reaping profit at the expense of people’s lives and the environment.
They have little regard for democratic processes, and, as we now know, they will stop at nothing to undermine any process that could interfere with business as usual.
The only way to prevent them from doing so is to kick them out of the room.
We have the tools to do it.
We just need to use them.
A Tax on Robots?
ATHENS – Ken makes a decent living operating a large harvester on behalf of farmer Luke.
Ken’s salary generates income tax and social security payments that help finance government programs for less fortunate members of his community.
Alas, Luke is about to replace Ken with Nexus, a robot that can operate the harvester longer, more safely, in any weather, and without lunch breaks, holidays, or sick pay.
Bill Gates thinks that, to ease the inequality and offset the social costs implied by automation’s displacement effects, either Nexus should pay income tax, or Luke should pay a hefty tax for replacing Ken with a robot.
And this “robot tax” should be used to finance something like a universal basic income (UBI).
Gates’s proposal, one of many variants on the UBI theme, allows us to glimpse fascinating aspects of capitalism and human nature that rich societies have neglected for too long.
The whole point of automation is that, unlike Ken, Nexus will never negotiate a labor contract with Luke.
Indeed, it will receive no income.
The only way to simulate an income tax on behalf of Nexus is to use Ken’s last annual income as a reference salary and extract from Luke’s revenues income tax and social security charges equivalent to what Ken paid.
There are three problems with this approach.
For starters, whereas Ken’s income would have changed over time had he not been fired, the reference salary cannot change, except arbitrarily and in a manner setting the tax authorities against business.
The tax office and Luke would end up clashing over impossible estimates of the extent to which Ken’s salary would have risen, or fallen, had he still been employed.
Second, the advent of robot-operated machines that have never been operated by humans means there will be no prior human income to act as a reference salary for calculating the taxes these robots must pay.
Finally, it is hard philosophically to justify forcing Luke to pay “income” tax for Nexus but not for the harvester that Nexus operates.
After all, both are machines, and the harvester has displaced far more human labor than Nexus has.
The only defensible justification for treating them differently is that Nexus has greater autonomy.
But to what extent is Nexus genuinely autonomous in a manner that the harvester is not?
However advanced Nexus might be, it can be thought of as autonomous if and only if it develops consciousness, whether spontaneously or with the help of its makers.
Only if Nexus (like the Nexus-6 replicants in the 1982 film Blade Runner) achieves that leap will “he” have earned the “right” to be thought of as distinct from the harvester he operates.
But then humanity will have spawned a new species and a new civil rights movement (which I would gladly join) demanding freedom for Nexus and equal rights with Ken – including a living wage, minimum benefits, and enfranchisement.
Assuming that robots cannot be made to pay income tax without creating new potential for conflict between the tax authorities and business (accompanied by tax arbitrage and corruption), what about taxing Nexus at the point of sale to Luke?
That would of course be possible: the state would collect a lump-sum tax from Luke the moment he replaces Ken with Nexus.
Gates supports this second-best alternative to making robots “pay” income tax.
He thinks that slowing down automation and creating tax disincentives to counter technology’s displacement effect is, overall, a sensible policy.
But a lump-sum tax on robots would merely lead robot producers to bundle artificial intelligence within other machinery.
Nexus will increasingly be incorporated within the harvester, making it impossible to tax the robotic element separately from the dumb parts that do the harvesting.
Either the robot sales tax should be dropped or it should be generalized into a capital goods sales tax.
But imagine the uproar against a tax on all capital goods: Woe betide those who would diminish domestic productivity and competitiveness!
Ever since the emergence of industrial capitalism, we have been terrible at differentiating between property and capital, and thus between wealth, rent, and profits.
This is why a wealth tax is so difficult to design.
The conceptual problem of differentiating between Nexus and the harvester “he” operates would make it impossible to agree on how a robot tax should work.
But why make life under capitalism more complicated than it already is?
There is an alternative to a robot tax that is easy to implement and simple to justify: a universal basic dividend (UBD), financed from the returns on all capital.
Imagine that a fixed portion of new equity issues (IPOs) goes into a public trust that, in turn, generates an income stream from which a UBD is paid.
Effectively, society becomes a shareholder in every corporation, and the dividends are distributed evenly to all citizens.
To the extent that automation improves productivity and corporate profitability, the whole of society would begin to share the benefits.
No new tax, no complications in the tax code, and no effect on the existing funding of the welfare state.
Indeed, as higher profits and their automatic redistribution via the UBD boosted incomes, more funds would become available for the welfare state.
Coupled with stronger labor rights and a decent living wage, the ideal of shared prosperity would receive a new lease on life.
The first two industrial revolutions were built on machines produced by great inventors in glorified barns and bought by cunning entrepreneurs who demanded property rights over the income stream “their” machines generated.
Today’s technological revolution is marked by the increasing socialization of the production of capital.
A practical response would be to socialize the property rights over the large income streams capital is now generating.
In short, forget about taxing either Nexus or Luke.
Instead, place a portion of Luke’s equity in the farm in a public trust, which then provides a universal payment to everyone.
In addition, we must legislate to improve the wages and conditions of every human still in employment, while our taxes provide Ken unemployment benefits, a guaranteed paid job in his community, or retraining.
Engineering Better Refugee Health Care
BOSTON – A resurgence of nativism and xenophobia in countries around the world has created a toxic environment for those fleeing from geopolitical crises.
But among the many challenges that refugees must confront while they await resettlement, finding access to high-quality physical and mental health care tops the list.
It is a challenge that demands more attention not just from doctors, nurses, non-governmental organizations, and other relevant actors, but also from engineers, who can make indispensable contributions to global public health. Those contributions are highly relevant to refugees.
Beyond building bridges and creating gadgets, engineers can help improve the quality and affordability of health care around the world, by developing faster methods for diagnosing diseases and delivering medical services.
Scientists and engineers in my own research area have already invented devices to help vulnerable babies breathe easier, detect malaria and HIV in war zones, and keep counterfeit medicines out of rural areas.
Still, not enough engineering expertise has been brought to bear in refugee settlements, whose populations have swelled in recent years as more people have had to flee from conflicts and natural disasters.
The UN estimates that there are more than 65 million forcibly displaced people in the world today, and that more refugees live in formal and informal encampments than ever before.
Although governments and NGOs have made efforts to provide basic health care to refugees, they have struggled to do so reliably.
Engineers have both an opportunity and a responsibility to close crucial gaps in the current system.
Tackling this challenge will require greater attention in three key areas.
The first is the classroom, where we should continue to raise awareness – particularly in the field of biomedical engineering – of the health-care challenges that refugees face.
Moreover, faculty, students, researchers, and practitioners who have an interest in developing appropriate solutions to global health problems should be afforded the opportunity to do so.
At the moment, there are too few educational programs that focus specifically on crisis-related biomedical engineering issues.
Fortunately, however, there are existing models to follow.
At the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, for example, the free online course “Health in Humanitarian Crises” is bringing the issue to students in engineering departments globally.
At the American University of Beirut, summer school students recently introduced engineering strategies for helping displaced people.
And at my institution, Boston University, we research ways to improve the quality and practice of medicine in the developing world.
In 2012, my colleagues and I created PharmaChk, a portable device that doctors can use to detect fake or ineffective medications in hard-to-reach places.
Second, governments and NGOs that work with refugees can do more to include medical engineering professionals in their efforts.
Private and public entities such as the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, USAID, and Grand Challenges Canada have worked with engineers to produce rigorous, ethically sound, and scalable medical solutions in global health, and the same should be done with respect to displaced people.
Third, and perhaps most important, engineers themselves need to step up their engagement with people and groups working on the front lines of the refugee crisis.
That means working with local hospitals, clinics, ministries, and health-care providers, which can serve as key conduits for bioengineering expertise.
Cross-disciplinary learning is important not only for spreading awareness, but also for improving the financial sustainability and scalability of technological innovations.
A handful of bioengineering startups and aid groups, such as Engineers Without Borders, have begun to tackle health-related problems in refugee communities.
These efforts have generally focused on methods for improving water sanitation and energy delivery.
Other initiatives, such as telemedicine, in which clinical medical advice is delivered through mobile phones, have become a lifeline for many communities.
Beyond these examples, efforts to engineer health-care solutions in refugee communities have been limited.
To apply biomedical engineering to refugee health challenges, students, experts, and practitioners need to familiarize themselves with conditions in refugee settlements, and deepen their understanding of the complex traumas that afflict refugees.
Refugee camps need robust point-of-care solutions that are not just effective, but also culturally sensitive and socially responsible.
Throughout history, engineers have been society’s problem solvers.
Today, creative thinking is needed to mitigate the plight of those who have been forcibly displaced from their homes.
The international community has proved incapable of ending the crises that are currently sending refugees in search of safety. But biomedical engineers can at least ensure that they receive the care they need.
Barbarians at the Monetary Gate
HONG KONG – Financial markets today are thriving.
The Dow Jones industrial average, the S&P 500, and the Nasdaq composite index have all reached record highs lately, with emerging-economy financial markets also performing strongly, as investors search for stability amid widespread uncertainty.
But, because this performance is not based on market fundamentals, it is unsustainable – and very risky.
According to Mohamed El-Erian, the lost lesson of the 2007 financial crisis is that current economic-growth models are “overly reliant on liquidity and leverage – from private financial institutions, and then from central banks.”
And, indeed, a key driver of financial markets’ performance today is the expectation of continued central-bank liquidity.
After the US Federal Reserved revealed its decision last month to leave interest rates unchanged, the Dow Jones industrial average set intraday and closing records; the Nasdaq, too, reached all-time highs.
Now, financial markets are waiting for signals from this year’s meeting of the world’s major central bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.
But there is another factor that could further destabilize an already-tenuous leverage- and liquidity-based system: digital currencies.
And, on this front, policymakers and regulators have far less control.
The concept of private cryptocurrencies was born of mistrust of official money.
In 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto – the mysterious creator of bitcoin, the first decentralized digital currency – described it as a “purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash,” which “would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.”
A 2016 working paper by the International Monetary Fund distinguished digital currency (legal tender that could be digitized) from virtual currency (non-legal tender).
Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency, or a kind of virtual currency that uses cryptography and distributed ledgers (the blockchain) to keep transactions both public and fully anonymous.
However you slice it, the fact is that, nine years after Nakamoto introduced bitcoin, the concept of private electronic money is poised to transform the financial-market landscape.
This month, the value of bitcoin reached $4,483, with a market cap of $74.5 billion, more than five times larger than at the beginning of 2017.
Whether this is a bubble, destined to collapse, or a sign of a more radical shift in the concept of money, the implications for central banking and financial stability will be profound.
At first, central bankers and regulators were rather supportive of the innovation represented by bitcoin and the blockchain that underpins it.
It is difficult to argue that people should not be allowed to use a privately created asset to settle transactions without the involvement of the state.
But national authorities were wary of potential illegal uses of such assets, reflected in the bitcoin-enabled, dark-web marketplace called Silk Road, a clearinghouse for, among other things, illicit drugs.
Silk Road was shut down in 2013, but more such marketplaces have sprung up.
When the bitcoin exchange Mt.
Gox failed in 2014, some central banks, such as the People’s Bank of China, started discouraging the use of bitcoin.
By November 2015, the Bank for International Settlements’ Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures, made up of ten major central banks, launched an in-depth examination of digital currencies.
But the danger of cryptocurrencies extends beyond facilitation of illegal activities. Like conventional currencies, cryptocurrencies have no intrinsic value.
But, unlike official money, they also have no corresponding liability, meaning that there is no institution like a central bank with a vested interest in sustaining their value.
Instead, cryptocurrencies function based on the willingness of people engaged in transactions to treat them as valuable.
With the value of the proposition depending on attracting more and more users, cryptocurrencies take on the quality of a Ponzi scheme.
As the scale of cryptocurrency usage expands, so do the potential consequences of a collapse.
Already, the market capitalization of cryptocurrencies amounts to nearly one tenth the value of the physical stock of official gold, with the capability to handle significantly larger payment operations, owing to low transaction costs.
That means that cryptocurrencies are already systemic in scale.
There is no telling how far this trend will go.
Technically, the supply of cryptocurrencies is infinite: bitcoin is capped at 21 million units, but this can be increased if a majority of “miners” (who add transaction records to the public ledger) agree.
Demand is related to mistrust of conventional stores of value.
If people fear that excessive taxation, regulation, or social or financial instability places their assets at risk, they will increasingly turn to cryptocurrencies.
Last year’s IMF report indicated that cryptocurrencies have already been used to circumvent exchange and capital controls in China, Cyprus, Greece, and Venezuela.
For countries subject to political uncertainty or social unrest, cryptocurrencies offer an attractive mechanism of capital flight, exacerbating the difficulties of maintaining domestic financial stability.
Moreover, while the state has no role in managing cryptocurrencies, it will be responsible for cleaning up any mess left by a burst bubble.
And, depending on where and when a bubble bursts, the mess could be substantial.
In advanced economies with reserve currencies, central banks may be able to mitigate the damage.
The same may not be true for emerging economies.
An invasive new species does not pose an immediate threat to the largest trees in the forest.
But it doesn’t take long for less-developed systems – the saplings on the forest floor – to feel the effects.
Cryptocurrencies are not merely new species to watch with interest; central banks must act now to rein in the very real threats they pose.
Crypto-Fool’s Gold?
CAMBRIDGE – Is the cryptocurrency Bitcoin the biggest bubble in the world today, or a great investment bet on the cutting edge of new-age financial technology?
My best guess is that in the long run, the technology will thrive, but that the price of Bitcoin will collapse.
If you haven’t been following the Bitcoin story, its price is up 600% over the past 12 months, and 1,600% in the past 24 months.
At over $4,200 (as of October 5), a single unit of the virtual currency is now worth more than three times an ounce of gold.
Some Bitcoin evangelists see it going far higher in the next few years.
What happens from here will depend a lot on how governments react.
Will they tolerate anonymous payment systems that facilitate tax evasion and crime?
Will they create digital currencies of their own?
Another key question is how successfully Bitcoin’s numerous “alt-coin” competitors can penetrate the market.
In principle, it is supremely easy to clone or improve on Bitcoin’s technology.
What is not so easy is to duplicate Bitcoin’s established lead in credibility and the large ecosystem of applications that have built up around it.
For now, the regulatory environment remains a free-for-all.
China’s government, concerned about the use of Bitcoin in capital flight and tax evasion, has recently banned Bitcoin exchanges.
Japan, on the other hand, has enshrined Bitcoin as legal tender, in an apparent bid to become the global center of fintech.
The United States is taking tentative steps to follow Japan in regulating fintech, though the endgame is far from clear.
Importantly, Bitcoin does not need to win every battle to justify a sky-high price.
Japan, the world’s third largest economy, has an extraordinarily high currency-to-income ratio (roughly 20%), so Bitcoin’s success there is a major triumph.
In Silicon Valley, drooling executives are both investing in Bitcoin and pouring money into competitors.
After Bitcoin, the most important is Ethereum.
The sweeping, Amazon-like ambition of Ethereum is to allow its users to employ the same general technology to negotiate and write “smart contracts” for just about anything.
As of early October, Ethereum’s market capitalization stood at $28 billion, versus $72 billon for Bitcoin.
Ripple, a platform championed by the banking sector to slash transaction costs for interbank and overseas transfers, is a distant third at $9 billion.
Behind the top three are dozens of fledgling competitors.
Most experts agree that the ingenious technology behind virtual currencies may have broad applications for cyber security, which currently poses one of the biggest challenges to the stability of the global financial system.
For many developers, the goal of achieving a cheaper, more secure payments mechanism has supplanted Bitcoin’s ambition of replacing dollars.
But it is folly to think that Bitcoin will ever be allowed to supplant central-bank-issued money.
It is one thing for governments to allow small anonymous transactions with virtual currencies; indeed, this would be desirable.
But it is an entirely different matter for governments to allow large-scale anonymous payments, which would make it extremely difficult to collect taxes or counter criminal activity.
Of course, as I note in my recent book on past, present, and future currencies, governments that issue large-denomination bills also risk aiding tax evasion and crime.
But cash at least has bulk, unlike virtual currency.
It will be interesting to see how the Japanese experiment evolves.
The government has indicated that it will force Bitcoin exchanges to be on the lookout for criminal activity and to collect information on deposit holders.
Still, one can be sure that global tax evaders will seek ways to acquire Bitcoin anonymously abroad and then launder their money through Japanese accounts.
Carrying paper currency in and out of a country is a major cost for tax evaders and criminals; by embracing virtual currencies, Japan risks becoming a Switzerland-like tax haven – with the bank secrecy laws baked into the technology.
Were Bitcoin stripped of its near-anonymity, it would be hard to justify its current price.
Perhaps Bitcoin speculators are betting that there will always be a consortium of rogue states allowing anonymous Bitcoin usage, or even state actors such as North Korea that will exploit it.
Would the price of Bitcoin drop to zero if governments could perfectly observe transactions?
Perhaps not.
Even though Bitcoin transactions require an exorbitant amount of electricity, with some improvements, Bitcoin might still beat the 2% fees the big banks charge on credit and debit cards.
Finally, it is hard to see what would stop central banks from creating their own digital currencies and using regulation to tilt the playing field until they win.
The long history of currency tells us that what the private sector innovates, the state eventually regulates and appropriates.
I have no idea where Bitcoin’s price will go over the next couple years, but there is no reason to expect virtual currency to avoid a similar fate.
Capitalizing on Climate Unity
BONN – When Donald Trump was elected US president a year ago, some said the end of the Paris climate agreement was nigh.
Yet, as the latest round of global climate talks in Bonn, Germany, has shown, the world’s political leaders are more committed to the deal than ever.
This is good news, but the fact remains that countries’ commitments do not yet add up to enough to turn the tide – and our window of opportunity to act effectively on climate change is rapidly closing.
Trump’s decision to withdraw the United States – the world’s largest historical carbon dioxide emitter – from the Paris agreement dealt the accord a major blow.
Many of America’s closest allies – including both of our countries, the Marshall Islands and Australia – were deeply disappointed by the move, which was shortsighted, for both America and the world.
But it is hard not to take heart from the fresh wave of global resolve Trump’s decision has unleashed, both globally and within the US itself.
Almost every major US state, city, and company has now pledged to do more to ensure that their country can meet its commitments, despite the Trump administration’s opposition.
The fact that climate action is now the worlds’ biggest economic opportunity has certainly helped.
According to the Trump administration’s own analysis, more than twice as many Americans are now working in the solar industry than in coal, oil, and gas combined.
And earlier this year, the OECD indicated that we could boost global growth by 5% per year by 2050, simply by linking the climate and growth agendas.
There is no time to waste; climate change has already arrived.
This year’s record-breaking drought in the Marshall Islands, apocalyptic storms in the Caribbean, and devastating floods in Bangladesh and the US demonstrate this.
As the United Nations Environment Programme recently reminded us, even if every country hits its existing 2030 emissions-reduction targets, we will be unable to limit warming to below 1.5° Celsius above preindustrial levels – the threshold, recognized in the Paris agreement, beyond which the impact of climate change becomes far greater.
Our chances even of staying within the more conservative – and dangerous – 2° Celsius limit will be slim.
To ignore this reality is to gamble with the existential future of many island countries, not to mention the prosperity of the global economy.
Without a sharp rise in global ambition for emissions reductions by 2020, we will be unable to save the world’s most vulnerable countries.
And if runaway climate change takes hold, no country will be immune to its effects.
Unfortunately, things will get a lot worse before they get better.
That is why we must step up our efforts to boost our resilience to the climate effects we won’t be able to avoid, and address the associated security consequences.
In the meantime, we must urgently increase the ambition of our climate commitments.
Fortunately, several upcoming events offer an opportunity to do just that.
We need to seize that opportunity with both hands.
Next month, French President Emmanuel Macron will host a conference to mark the two-year anniversary of the Paris agreement.
And next September, California Governor Jerry Brown will host his own summit to galvanize greater action by cities, companies, and other non-state actors.
The biggest opportunity, however, will come in 2019, when UN Secretary-General António Guterres convenes world leaders in New York for the biggest climate gathering since the Paris talks.
We need to build an arc of ambition across these events that can, in the words of our friend Tony de Brum, the late Marshallese foreign minister and untiring climate warrior at the Paris conference, deliver a pathway to survival for the most vulnerable.
Some significant players are already going above and beyond their pledges.
A number of others, including the Marshall Islands, are set to bring forward new targets by 2020, to augment their current targets, which reach only as far as 2025.
Still others – including France, India, and New Zealand – have said informally that they are eager to do more.
The truth is that almost all countries have the capacity to do more, especially if the support is there and the opportunities are identified.
The imperative now is to create the right political conditions both to motivate and facilitate action.
As more countries signal their ability to increase the ambition of their commitments, still more will follow.
At the same time, we must ensure that every sector, as well as every country, does its fair share.
This includes, for example, international shipping, which, if it were a country, would be the world’s sixth-largest emitter.
Next year’s “Talanoa Dialogue” – to be convened by Fiji, which last week became the first island state to chair UN climate talks – will help countries identify exactly how they can achieve the goals set in the Paris agreement.
That dialogue, which countries should approach in good faith, must be a springboard for further action.
To that end, the recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report laying out pathways for keeping the temperature rise below the 1.5°C threshold will be crucial.
The science remains key.
The Paris talks proved that political success is possible, if leaders are given the right platform, if civil society mobilizes behind them, and if the world acts in unison.
To get the rest of the way to a sustainable future, we must apply this lesson again.
The catchphrase at the Bonn conference was “further, faster, and together.”
Our collective challenge is to translate a nice-sounding slogan into reality.
The Risks to America’s Booming Economy
CAMBRIDGE – After a long and slow recovery from the recession that began a decade ago, the United States economy is now booming.
The labor market is at full employment, the inflation rate is rising, and households are optimistic.
Manufacturing firms and homebuilders are benefiting from increasing activity.
The economy is poised for stronger growth in the year ahead.
We no longer hear worries about secular stagnation.
The overall unemployment rate is just 4.7%, while unemployment among college graduates is only 2.4%.
Average hourly earnings are 2.8% higher than they were a year ago.
The tight labor market and rising wages are inducing some individuals who had stopped looking for work to return to the labor force, boosting the participation rate.
A clear indication that the economy is at full employment is that the rate of inflation is increasing.
The “core” consumer price index (which omits volatile energy and food prices) has reached an annual rate of 2.2%, substantially higher than the 1.8% average during the previous three years.
During the most recent three months, core inflation rose at a 2.8% annual rate.
Household wealth is also increasing.
The price of homes, the most important asset for US households, rose by 5% during the most recent 12 months.
The rising stock market has caused the broader measure of net worth to increase even faster.
Surveys of consumer attitudes point to strong positive feelings.
The University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index recently reached a 17-year high.
Likewise, the Conference Board Consumer Confidence Index hit a 15-year high in February.
Manufacturing firms have increased output in each of the last six months.
Homebuilders are racing to keep up with demand, reflected in an increase of more than 6% in the number of new single-family houses in the past 12 months.
All of this suggests that real (inflation-adjusted) GDP will rise more quickly in 2017 than it did in the recent past.
While volatile trade and inventory numbers have depressed the recent GDP figures, the more fundamental measure of final sales to private purchasers has been rising in real terms at an annual rate of about 2.5%.
Overall GDP is likely to increase at a similar rate for 2017 as a whole.
But, although the economy currently is healthy, it is also fragile.
The US has experienced a decade of excessively low interest rates, which have caused investors and lenders to seek higher yields by bidding up the prices of all types of assets and making risky loans.
The danger is that overpriced assets and high-risk loans could lose value and cause an economic downturn.
The price-earnings ratio of the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index is now nearly 70% above its historic average.
A return of the price-earnings ratio to its historic average would cause share prices to decline by 40%, implying a loss of more than $9 trillion, an amount equal to nearly half of total GDP.
Ten-year Treasury bonds now yield just 2.5%.
With the current inflation rate of more than 2% and markets anticipating a similar inflation rate over the longer term (as measured by five-year five-year-forward inflation expectations), the yield on ten-year Treasury bonds should be above 4%.
A rise of the ten-year yield to 4% would reduce the value of those bonds substantially.
Other long-term bonds – both government bonds and corporate bonds – would suffer similar declines.
Reaching for yield has also narrowed credit spreads between high-grade bonds and riskier domestic and emerging-market bonds.
And commercial real-estate prices have been bid up to levels that are probably not sustainable.
At the same time, banks and other lenders have extended loans bearing interest rates that do not reflect the riskiness of the borrowers.
And, because these covenant-light loans impose fewer conditions on the borrowers, they are more susceptible to default if economic conditions deteriorate.
But a bad outcome is not inevitable.
None of the risks I have described may materialize.
Interest rates may return to normal levels, and asset prices may gradually correct.
But there is a clear risk that a decade of excessively low interest rates will cause a collapse of asset prices and an economic downturn.
This will be a major challenge to the US Federal Reserve and the Trump administration in the year ahead.
America’s Bad Border Tax
NEW YORK – The United States may be about to implement a border adjustment tax.
The Republican Party, now in control of the legislative and executive branches, views a BAT – which would effectively subsidize US exporters, by giving them tax breaks, while penalizing US companies that import goods – as an important element of corporate-tax reform.
They claim that it would improve the US trade balance, while boosting domestic production, investment, and employment.
They are wrong.
The truth is that the Republicans’ plan is highly problematic.
Along with other proposed reforms, the BAT would turn the US corporate income tax into a tax on corporate cash flow (with border adjustment), implying far-reaching consequences for US companies’ competitiveness and profitability.
Some sectors or firms – especially those that rely heavily on imports, such as US retailers – would face sharp increases in their tax liabilities; in some cases, these increases would be even greater than their pre-tax profits.
Meanwhile, sectors or firms that export, like those in manufacturing, would enjoy significant reductions in their tax burden.
This divergence seems both unwarranted and unfair.
The BAT would have other distributional implications, too.
Studies indicate that it may hit consumers among the bottom 10% of income earners hardest.
Yet it has been promoted as a way to offset the corporate-tax cuts that Republicans are also pushing – cuts that would ultimately benefit those at the top of the income distribution.
Making matters worse, the BAT would not actually protect US firms from foreign competition.
Economic theory suggests that, in principle, a BAT could push up the value of the dollar by as much as the tax, thereby nullifying its effects on the relative competitiveness of imports and exports.
Moreover, the balance-sheet effects of dollar appreciation would be large.
Because most foreign assets held by US investors are denominated in a foreign currency, the value of those assets could be reduced by several trillion dollars, in total.
Meanwhile, the highly indebted emerging economies would face ballooning dollar liabilities, which could cause financial distress and even crises.
Even if the US dollar appreciated less than the BAT, the pass-through from the tax on imports to domestic prices would imply a temporary but persistent rise in the inflation rate.
Some studies suggest that, in the BAT’s first year, the new tax could push up US inflation by 1%, or even more.
The US Federal Reserve may respond to such an increase by hiking its policy rate, a move that would ultimately lead to a rise in long-term interest rates and place further upward pressure on the dollar’s exchange rate.
Yet another problem with the BAT is that it would create massive disruptions in the global supply chains that the US corporate sector has built over the last few decades.
By undermining companies’ capacity to maximize the efficiency of labor and capital allocation – the driving motivation behind offshoring – the BAT would produce large welfare costs for the US and the global economy.
The final major problem with the BAT is that it violates World Trade Organization rules, which allow border adjustment only on indirect taxation, such as value-added tax, not on direct taxes, like those levied on corporate income.
Given this, the WTO would probably rule the BAT illegal.
In that case, the US could face retaliatory measures worth up to $400 billion per year if it didn’t repeal the tax.
That would deal a serious blow to US and global GDP growth.
So how likely is the US to enact the BAT?
The proposal has the support of the Republican majority in the House of Representatives, but a number of Senate Republicans are likely to vote against it.
Democrats in both houses of Congress are likely to vote against the entire proposed corporate-tax reform, including the BAT.
The executive branch is also split on the issue, with President Donald Trump’s more protectionist advisers supporting it and his more internationalist counselors opposing it.
Trump himself has sent mixed signals.
Disagreement over the BAT extends to business as well, with firms that export more than they import supporting it, and vice versa.
As for the general public, low- and middle-income households should oppose the BAT, which would drive up prices of the now-cheap imported goods that these groups currently consume, though Trump’s blue-collar constituents, particularly those who work in manufacturing, may support the measure.
Ultimately, the case for the BAT is relatively weak – far weaker than the case against it.
While this may be enough to ensure that it doesn’t pass, there are strong protectionist forces in the US government pushing hard for it and similar policies.
Even if the BAT is rejected, the risk of a damaging global trade war triggered by the Trump administration will continue to loom large.
Brazil’s Argentina Moment
CAMBRIDGE – Brazil’s economy has been in free fall, a casualty of years of economic mismanagement and the vast corruption scandal that has engulfed the country’s political and business establishment – and which now threatens to bring down the second president in as many years.
It may seem hard to focus on policy developments amid the political and economic turmoil, but the fact remains that Brazil must overcome fundamental challenges if it is to lay the groundwork for sustainable growth.
Few loom as large as the country’s fiscal woes.
There is a strong argument that Brazil’s overstretched government finances have long held back the economy.
At 36%, the ratio of government spending to GDP is one of the highest among countries at a similar income level.
Years of fiscal laxity, mounting social security obligations, and low commodity prices have greatly magnified concerns – now compounded by the political crisis – about the government’s debt burden, which now stands at about 70% of GDP.
The high interest rates required to finance the perilous fiscal position aggravates it further: higher interest payments account for much of the difference in spending between Brazil and peer countries.
Against this background, Brazil’s National Congress, seeking to regain market confidence, approved an unprecedented constitutional amendment last December that imposes a ceiling on non-interest government expenditures, indexed to the previous year’s inflation rate, for a period of at least ten years.
As long as it holds, the spending cap ensures that the size of the government (excluding interest payments) will shrink as a share of national income in every year that the economy experiences real growth.
The International Monetary Fund enthusiastically endorsed it at the time, calling it a potential fiscal “game changer.”
But is it?
Taken at face value, the economic justification for a spending cap is surprisingly weak.
Nothing in economic theory supports keeping real government spending constant over a period as long as a decade.
As large as the size of Brazil’s government is, there is no magic ratio of spending to GDP that would ensure sustained growth.
Furthermore, the ceiling does not distinguish between government consumption and investment.
And, in practice, it is likely to become more of a target than a ceiling, thereby removing room for countercyclical fiscal policy during a future downturn.
Even as a signal for market confidence, the idea of a cap on future spending has important weaknesses.
As long as the economy contracts, a spending cap in fact does not impart much discipline; it does not force the government to shrink in step with the economy.
Fiscal contraction is, in Augustinian fashion, deferred to the future – not exactly a confidence booster.
Indeed, the IMF, arguing that the spending cap is inadequate, has pushed for additional frontloaded fiscal adjustment.
Perhaps desperate times call for desperate measures.
Brazil’s move resembles Argentina’s convertibility plan of 1991, which abolished all currency controls and pegged the Argentine peso to the US dollar.
Facing hyperinflation and a complete loss of market confidence, the government sought to buy credibility by placing monetary policy on automatic pilot.
Argentina’s message to markets was, “look, we have no discretion over monetary policy.”
Similarly, Brazil is telling markets it will shrink the government (as long as the economy is growing).
In both cases, the promises are backed up by legal or even constitutional changes.
When credibility becomes the binding constraint on economic recovery, measures such as these may make sense – as long as they have the intended effect on market confidence.
In fact, long-term interest rates on Brazilian government bonds have come down significantly since the amendment was passed (though it is hard to pinpoint the causal impact of the rule itself), and remain well below pre-amendment levels, despite the short-lived spike that followed the release of a recording of President Michel Temer allegedly authorizing illegal payments to a jailed congressman.
But as Argentina found out several years down the line, binding fiscal legislation can itself become a powerful constraint on economic recovery.
By the late 1990s, Argentina’s overwhelming problem had become an overvalued currency.
Successive governments stuck with the convertibility law for fear of losing credibility, but aggravated the economy’s competitiveness crisis as a result.
Eventually, amid street riots and political mayhem, Argentina abandoned the currency peg in 2002.
Viewed with Argentina’s experience in mind, Brazil’s spending cap looks problematic – all the more so against a backdrop of political turmoil that is set to continue for the foreseeable future.
The cap will likely become even more politically controversial once Brazil recovers, as it will.
It is not hard to imagine the next administration – whenever it comes about – perceiving the cap as an obstacle to faster economic growth.
The cap’s defenders will sound unconvincing, because the economic case for it is weak in the absence of extreme credibility problems.
Indeed, the cap will undermine itself to the extent that it succeeds in addressing the credibility issue.
Brazil could become a prisoner of the policy’s totemic value as a commitment device, even as it outlives its usefulness as such.
The irony will not be lost on investors or Argentines: countries that can write a spending cap into the Constitution on short notice are also those where it could be just as easily removed.
There are good reasons why democracies sometimes tie their hands or delegate decision-making.
Independent central banks or fiscal commissions, for example, can help governments overcome the temptation of short-term manipulation of the economy at longer-term cost.
But Brazil’s spending cap does not look like a sustainable solution.
While born of a real sense of fiscal urgency, the biggest risk is that it will eventually fuel political conflict around the ceiling itself, rather than foster deliberation about the difficult fiscal choices that must be made.
The Rise of Demotic Democracy in Europe
LONDON – The shock of the British vote to leave the European Union has yet to sink in.
Yet European leaders must steel themselves for what is to come.
In fact, Brexit might be the initial tremor that triggers a tsunami of referenda in Europe in the coming years.
Across Europe, there are 47 insurgent parties turning politics on its head.
They are gaining control of the political agenda, shaping it according to their interests – and winning power in the process.
In one-third of EU member states, such parties are members of coalition governments, and their success has driven mainstream parties to adopt some of their positions.
Though these parties have very different roots, they all have one thing in common: all are trying to upend the foreign-policy consensus that has defined Europe for several decades.
They are Euroskeptic; they spurn NATO; they want to close their borders and stop free trade.
They are changing the face of politics, replacing traditional left-right battles with clashes pitting their own angry nativism against the cosmopolitanism of the elites they disdain.
These parties’ weapon of choice is the referendum, with which they can whip up popular support for their pet issues.
According to the European Council on Foreign Relations, 32 referenda are being demanded in 18 countries across the EU.
Some, such as the Danish People’s Party, want to follow the United Kingdom’s lead and hold a vote on EU membership.
Others want to escape from the eurozone, block the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) with the United States, or restrict labor mobility.
The EU’s refugee relocation scheme has proved to be particularly divisive.
Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán has declared that he will hold a referendum on the proposed quotas.
And the Polish opposition party Kukiz ’15 has been collecting signatures for its own referendum on the issue.
Handing power back to the masses through direct democracy may well be these parties’ most revolutionary proposition.
Indeed, it reflects an understanding of the frustrations that have driven a global wave of popular protests in recent years – protests that, in the Arab world, sparked actual revolutions.
The same spirit of protest that drove, say, Spaniards, Greeks, and New Yorkers to take to the streets – with different demands, to be sure – is fueling support for these new referenda and the insurgent parties that are bringing them about.
This is a nightmare not only for established parties, but also for democratic governance.
As California’s experience with referenda has shown, the public will often vote for contradictory things – for example, lower taxes and more welfare programs, or environmental protection and cheaper gas.
But for the EU, this dynamic is exponentially more challenging; indeed, it overturns the EU’s foundations.
The EU is, after all, the ultimate expression of representative democracy.
It is an enlightened body that places at its core liberal values such as individual rights, the protection of minorities, and a market-based economy.
But the layers of representation on which the EU relies have created the sense that a kind of “Über-elite” is running things, far removed from ordinary citizens.
This has given nationalist parties the perfect target for their anti-EU campaigns.
Add to that fear mongering about issues like immigration and trade, and their ability to attract frustrated or anxious voters is strong.
Two visions of Europe – the diplomatic and the demotic – are now facing off against each other.
The diplomatic Europe, incarnated by EU founding father Jean Monnet, took big, sensitive questions out of the sphere of popular politics and reduced them to manageable technical issues that diplomats could address through bureaucratic compromises behind closed doors.
The demotic Europe, exemplified by the UK Independence Party, which helped spearhead Brexit, is like Monnet in reverse, taking diplomatic compromises like the TTIP or the association agreement with Ukraine, and intentionally politicizing them.
Whereas diplomatic Europe is about finding reconciliation, demotic Europe is about polarization.
Diplomacy is win-win; direct democracy is zero-sum.
Diplomacy tries to lower the temperature; the demotic paradigm raises it.
Diplomats can work with one another; referenda are binary and fixed, leaving none of the political wiggle room and scope for creative compromise needed to resolve political problems.
In demotic Europe, solidarity is impossible.
Europe’s shift away from diplomacy began more than a decade ago, when the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe was rejected in popular referenda in France and the Netherlands.
That outcome may have put the EU out of the treaty-making business altogether, meaning that hopes of future integration may well be dashed.
But, in the wake of Brexit, future integration is not Europe’s biggest concern. Instead, it must contend with the increasingly powerful forces undermining the integration that has been achieved, attempting to push Europe backward.
Of course, one need only recall what was there before the EU to realize just how dangerous this path may be.
In this new era of “vetocracy” in Europe, the diplomacy that underpinned the creation of the enlightened and forward-looking European project cannot function, leaving the EU ungovernable.
Now that the Euroskeptics have gotten their way in the UK, vetocracy will become stronger than ever.
Direct votes on issues like trade rules or immigration policy will gut Europe’s representative democracy, just as direct votes on membership threaten to gut the EU itself.
In a popular novel by the Nobel laureate José Saramago, the Iberian Peninsula breaks off from the European mainland and drifts away.
With a tsunami of plebiscites bearing down on the continent, this may turn out to be a prescient metaphor.
The Economic Consequences of Brexit
LONDON – Those campaigning for Britain to exit the European Union claim that doing so would make their country both freer and richer.
They assert that after “Brexit”, the UK could quickly negotiate a bespoke agreement with the EU that offers all the benefits of free trade without the costs of EU membership; strike better trade deals with other countries; and reap huge benefits from scrapping burdensome EU regulations.
But this is a delusion.
In fact, Brexit would entail big economic costs for Britain.
The uncertainty and disruption of drawn-out and doubtless acrimonious divorce proceedings would depress investment and growth.
Permanent separation would reduce trade, foreign investment, and migration, hurting competition, productivity growth, and living standards.
And “independence” would deprive Britain of influence over future EU reforms – notably, the completion of the single market in services – from which it would benefit.
The London School of Economics’ Centre for Economic Performance calculates that the long-term costs to Britain of lower trade with the EU could be as high as 9.5% of GDP, while the fall in foreign investment could cost 3.4% of GDP or more.
Those costs alone dwarf the potential gains from Brexit.
Britain’s net contribution to the EU budget amounted to only 0.35% of GDP last year, and scrapping EU regulation would bring limited benefits, because the UK’s labor and product markets are already among the freest in the world.
The exit process would generate prolonged uncertainty. Officially, it is meant to take two years.
But it would probably take much longer.
In the 1980s, it took three years to negotiate the exit of Greenland (population: 50,000), and the only controversial issue was fish.
Extricating Britain (the EU’s second-largest economy, with a population of 64 million) would be far more complex.
Moreover, any agreement on a new economic relationship with the UK would require unanimity among the EU’s 27 remaining members.
And Britain would also have to renegotiate – from scratch – the 50-plus trade deals that the EU has with other countries.
All of this would take a long time.
In the meantime, Britain’s trading rules and domestic regulations would be up in the air. Investment and employment decisions would be postponed or canceled.
The pound would plummet. The foreign investors financing Britain’s current-account deficit – which hit 7% of GDP in the final quarter of last year – might drive up the risk premium on UK assets or, worse, pull out.
All of that would weaken economic growth, jeopardizing the government’s fiscal plans.
Once the agreements were made, Britain would have worse access to both EU and global markets.
Economically, the least painful option would be to seek membership of the European Economic Area, along with Norway, Iceland, and Liechtenstein.
That would provide almost full access to the single market (with opt-outs from EU agriculture and fisheries policies), albeit with customs controls and other trade barriers such as rules-of-origin requirements.
Politically, though, EEA membership would be a raw deal. Britain would have to comply with single-market rules and legislation in areas such as consumer protection, the environment, and social policy – rules that it would have no say in creating.
It would also have to contribute to the EU budget, without receiving any spending in return.
And it would have to allow EU citizens free entry, a political bugbear for most Brexit supporters.
Given that the key motivation for Brexit is to restore the country’s supposedly lost sovereignty, a deal that gives the UK no say, but requires that it pay and obey, would be deeply unpalatable.
Trading with the EU according to World Trade Organization rules, as the United States and China do, would involve the fewest political constraints.
Britain would be free to keep out hard-working, taxpaying EU migrants. But this would entail reciprocal EU controls on UK migrants, harming Britons twice over.
This approach would also entail import tariffs on British goods – including a 10% duty on its car exports to the EU – as well as non-tariff barriers.
UK-based financial institutions would lose their passport to export freely to the EU.
And without full access to the $16 trillion EU single market, with its 500 million consumers, foreign investment would drop.
Intermediate options, from the Swiss to the Canadian model, are scarcely more appealing.
Brexit supporters claim that Britain could strike its own special deal, cherry picking the provisions it likes.
The UK would have the whip hand, they argue, because it buys more from the EU than it sells in return.
But this, too, is a delusion.
The US also has a trade deficit with the EU, yet it doesn’t get to dictate terms in the negotiations over the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership.
Moreover, exports to the EU, at 13% of GDP, matter more to the UK than exports to Britain (just 3% of GDP) do to the EU.
In short, the EU would call the shots – and doubtless be tough with the UK.
Many economic actors – from German car manufacturers to French farmers to financial centers around the EU – would want to hamper their British competitors.
For their part, EU governments would want to punish Britain, not least because they know that a velvet divorce with Britain would bolster anti-EU parties, such as France’s far-right National Front, which has already called for a referendum on EU membership.
Britain’s new trade deals with non-EU countries would also probably involve worse terms.
While the UK wouldn’t be hamstrung by protectionist interests in the EU, its smaller economy, largely open markets, and desperation for deals would weaken its clout.
Indeed, the US has stated that it has no immediate interest in negotiating a trade deal with Britain.
And the protectionist tone of the current US presidential election campaign suggests that the next few years will not see much trade liberalization.
Thinking through all the economic implications of Brexit is complicated.
But the bottom line is simple: Leaving the EU would make Britain much worse off.
The Trade Costs of Leaving the EU
BRUSSELS – The “Brexiteers” – those who want Britain to leave the European Union – argue that their goal would be virtually cost-free and have no effect on the United Kingdom’s global trade.
They are wrong.
On June 23, when voters in Britain cast their ballots in the referendum on the question, they need to consider what is actually involved in leaving the EU – and how the free-trade benefits they now enjoy (and take for granted) could be maintained after Brexit.
Start with the basics. Leaving the EU means that the UK would exit the EU’s Customs Union, which is the basis for cross-border free trade among the EU’s 28 members (and establishes a common external tariff vis-à-vis third countries).
It also means exit from the Single Market – the basis for the free movement of goods and services among EU members.
By definition, non-members of the EU cannot belong to the Single Market.
So what would happen next?
During the two-year period before Britain’s withdrawal takes final effect, there would be UK-EU negotiations on many points – sovereignty, the legal order, immigration, finances, and economic matters.
The assumption is that a crucial goal for Britain would be to negotiate a trading relationship as close as possible to the free-trade relationships that exist today.
That is easier said than done. The best result would be if all players agreed to maintain the free trade already achieved, with the UK setting a new external tariff on a duty-free basis, applicable to all comers.
This is what happened in the 1970s after Britain and Denmark left the European Free Trade Association: Free-trade agreements were negotiated among EFTA members and between them and the EU (or the EEC as it was then known).
But Brexiteers should realize that there is no guarantee that this would happen again – and, in any case, there would be complications.
While this solution would be good for the 45% of British exports that are sold in EU markets, it would reduce protection for British industries to zero.
Under the rules of the World Trade Organization, the same import duties must be applied to all WTO participants – which means that if Britain’s imports from the EU are duty-free, its imports from the rest of the world must be, too.
The alternative would be for UK exporters to accept the EU’s common external tariff, and for the UK to create its own import tariff, applied to all imports, including from the EU.
Because the common tariff is at a relatively low level on industrial and fishery products, this might not be an insuperable barrier for UK exports, and it would allow some flexibility in protecting UK companies from imports.
The potential pitfall is that any British tariff increase above the EU level would expose the UK to claims for compensation from third countries in the WTO.
The bigger question that the Brexiteers need to answer is how to secure a high level of access to the EU’s internal market.
This is vitally important for Britain’s service industries, particularly for the City of London’s exports of financial services.
There is only one precedent for non-EU members being able to negotiate access to the internal market equivalent to that enjoyed by EU members. This is the European Economic Area agreement concluded with the EU by Norway, Iceland, and Liechtenstein in 1992.
In the view of many observers, including me, access to the Single Market through the EEA is no longer available. But what if we’re wrong?
The point is that such a deal would go against all the instincts (and rhetoric) of the Brexiteers, because it would mean accepting the EU’s “four freedoms”: not just the free movement of goods, services, and capital – but of people, too.
That would be hard to square with the Brexit objective of “controlling our borders.”
The Brexiteers would also blanch at Britain’s obligation under an EEA-type agreement to continue contributing to the EU budget.
Of course, there could be specific arrangements for particular sectors.
But it seems unlikely that such arrangements would be possible in financial services and the major professional services (including doctors, architects, and lawyers), which are important for Britain’s competitors in Europe.
Indeed, it is possible that the EU would adopt a tough mercantilist stance: If you want privileged access, you should stay in the club.
The final consequence of Brexit is that the UK would lose its free-trade arrangements with third countries under the many trade agreements that the EU has signed since 2000.
Replacing these agreements with bilateral deals would take time.
There is no guarantee that the EU would agree to an interim continuation of free trade, and it seems certain that UK exports would face higher tariffs than its former EU partners in those third countries (placing British exporters at a competitive disadvantage).
It’s a big stretch for the Brexiteers to ask us to believe that the world’s most prominent leaders, European or not, have all got the impact of Brexit wrong.
In the trade debate, we have had the International Monetary Fund, US President Barack Obama, and the OECD – quite apart from the UK Treasury – telling Britons that a vote to leave would be bad for the economy.
It is not much of a reply to argue that the OECD is “in the pay of the EU” or that Obama is anti-British because he had a Kenyan father in British colonial days.
Economic forecasting is an uncertain science.
But when almost all projections point in the same direction – that Brexit would be hugely damaging to the UK – it is time to decide what is credible and what is not.
Brexit In Reverse?
LONDON – Economic reality is beginning to catch up with the false hopes of many Britons.
One year ago, when a slim majority voted for the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union, they believed the promises of the popular press, and of the politicians who backed the Leave campaign, that Brexit would not reduce their living standards.
Indeed, in the year since, they have managed to maintain those standards by running up household debt.
This worked for a while, because the increase in household consumption stimulated the economy.
But the moment of truth for the UK economy is fast approaching.
As the latest figures published by the Bank of England show, wage growth in Britain is not keeping up with inflation, so real incomes have begun to fall.
As this trend continues in the coming months, households will soon realize that their living standards are falling, and they will have to adjust their spending habits.
To make matters worse, they will also realize that they have become over-indebted and will have to deleverage, thus further reducing the household consumption that has sustained the economy.
Moreover, the BoE has made the same mistake as the average household: it underestimated the impact of inflation and will now be catching up by raising interest rates in a pro-cyclical manner.
These higher rates will make household debt even harder to pay off.
The British are fast approaching the tipping point that characterizes all unsustainable economic trends.
I refer to such a tipping point as “reflexivity” – when both cause and effect shape each other.
Economic reality is reinforced by political reality.
The fact is that Brexit is a lose-lose proposition, harmful both to Britain and the EU.
The Brexit referendum cannot be undone, but people can change their minds.
Apparently, this is happening.
Prime Minister Theresa May’s attempt to strengthen her negotiating position by holding a snap election badly misfired: she lost her parliamentary majority and created a hung parliament (no single party has a majority).
The primary cause of May’s defeat was her fatal misstep in proposing that elderly people pay for a substantial portion of their social care out of their own resources, usually the value of the homes that they have lived in all of their lives.
This “dementia tax,” as it became widely known, deeply offended the core constituency, the elderly, of May’s Conservative Party.
Many either did not vote, or supported other parties.
The increased participation of young people was also an important contributing factor in May’s defeat.
Many of them voted for Labour in protest, not because they wanted to join a trade union or because they support Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn (although he gave an unexpectedly impressive performance throughout the campaign).
The attitude of Britain’s young people to the single market is diametrically opposed to that of May and supporters of a “hard” Brexit.
Young people are eager to find well-paying jobs, whether in Britain or elsewhere in Europe.
In that respect, their interests correspond with the interests of the City of London, where some of those jobs are to be found.
If May wants to remain in power, she must change her approach to the Brexit negotiations.
And there are signs that she is prepared to do so.
By approaching the negotiations that will start on June 19 in a conciliatory spirit, May could reach an understanding with the EU on the agenda and agree to continue as a member of the single market for a period long enough to carry out all the legal work that will be needed.
This would be a great relief to the EU, because it would postpone the evil day when Britain’s absence would create an enormous hole in the EU’s budget.
That would be a win-win arrangement.
Only by taking this path can May hope to persuade Parliament to pass all the laws that need to be in place once the Brexit talks are completed and Britain withdraws from the Union.
She may have to abandon her ill-considered alliance with the Democratic Unionist Party in Ulster and side more emphatically with the Tories of Scotland, who are keen on a softer version of Brexit.
May will also need to atone for the sins of the Tories in the London borough of Kensington with regard to last week’s Grenfell Tower fire, in which at least 30 people, and perhaps many more, lost their lives.
If May embraces such a platform, she could then carry on leading a minority government, because nobody else would want to take her place.
Brexit would still take at least five years to complete, during which time new elections would take place.
If all went well, the two parties might want to remarry even before they have divorced.
Britain’s Road to Perdition
LONDON – Full English Brexit is off the menu.
Before leaving the European Union altogether, the British government now wants an “interim period,” in which the United Kingdom would retain the commercial rights of EU membership, while still contributing to the EU budget, observing EU regulations and legal judgments, and allowing the free movement of people.
This period would last for at least two years after March 2019 – the official deadline for the Brexit process – meaning that until 2021, Britain would essentially be an EU member state without any voting rights.
In the meantime, British Prime Minister Theresa May’s government, having promised to maintain a “deep and special” relationship with Europe, would try to negotiate a new “treaty-based arrangement” with the EU.
But Britain will have a vanishingly small chance of concluding a new treaty in so short a time.
Indeed, come 2021, the UK will still be hurtling toward a “cliff edge”: a full break from Europe, with no alternative arrangement in place to cushion the blow.
Politically, that timing would pose even greater risks for May’s government than it faces today, since the next general election must be held by June 2022.
So the UK may try to extend the transition period beyond 2022.
And as past experience tells us, once an extension is granted, it may never end.
The UK seems to be approaching the scenario I outlined three months ago.
May’s fateful decision to hold an early election in June has allowed her opponents to demand that the UK negotiate a transitional arrangement similar to what Norway has as a member of the European Economic Area.
The EEA was originally created in 1994 as a temporary framework for various countries preparing to join the EU.
But because Norwegian voters rejected a referendum on EU membership 11 months later, the EEA has now lasted for 24 years.
Nobody can predict what will happen in 24 years.
But the good news for Britain is that the EU may already be moving slowly toward a two-track structure.
To prosper, the eurozone will need to establish a political union.
This will leave non-euro countries such as Denmark, Poland, and Sweden forming an outer ring of economic cooperation outside the eurozone.
These countries would have membership in the single market, but not in the monetary or political union.
A two-track Europe would be very different from the “two-speed” model that applies to Europe today.
In the latter, every country is theoretically heading toward “ever-closer union,” just at different rates.
In a two-track scenario, by contrast, Britain could comfortably re-join the outer track along with Norway and, perhaps, Switzerland.
Now for the bad news.
A transition arrangement for the UK may be unacceptable to both EU governments and British voters.
Committed federalists in the EU want Britain out as quickly as possible, because Britain has long given cover for others – such as Denmark, Poland, and Sweden – to resist deeper integration.
Federalist zealots hate the idea of a two-track Europe.
They want to force all EU member states to adopt the euro within the next decade, and to embed themselves permanently into a full-scale political and fiscal union.
And they rightly believe that achieving this goal will be easier with Britain out of the picture.
But a transition period is no panacea for the UK either.
Britons have already started to get a glimpse of the economic costs of Brexit, as international businesses that once used Britain as a hub for their European operations have started to relocate some of their activities.
As the UK government tries to maintain the fiction of a strictly time-limited transition, this process will accelerate further.
Moreover, the EU will use the transition period to change its own regulations, so that businesses generating employment and large tax revenues will have to move onto EU territory.
For example, the European Banking Authority and the European Medicines Agency are already relocating from London, meaning the many legal, managerial, and lobbying jobs connected to highly regulated activities such as finance and pharmaceutical research will have to relocate, too.
A transition period would thus hit international businesses based in Britain with a regulatory double-whammy: they would be subject to the whims of UK and EU bureaucracies at the same time.
Making matters worse, the promise of a long transition could delay the shift in public opinion needed to reverse Brexit before it is too late.
After March 28, 2019, the UK will be officially out of the EU, where economic growth has already started to overtake that of Britain.
If it ever wants to be readmitted, it will have to settle for far less attractive terms than what it enjoys today.
Not only would it no longer receive budget rebates or special treatment on social regulations; it might even be forced to join the euro.
Even the 48% of British voters who voted “Remain” might reject such humiliating terms.
Britain would thus be stuck in limbo – like Norway, but without the oil wealth or social cohesion.
As the Labour Party’s trade spokesman has aptly put it, a semi-permanent transition period based on the “Norway model” would turn Britain into a “vassal state.”
It would still pay large sums into the EU budget and adhere to EU laws, but it would have no say over how that money is spent or how those laws are made.
In the months ahead, the British public may start to foresee this humiliating endgame.
The Norway model will satisfy neither Britain’s elderly, provincial Europhobes, nor the young, urban voters who want to preserve the rights of EU citizenship that they have taken for granted all their lives.
With this depressing prospect setting in, British voters could change their minds about Brexit before their leaders go through with it.
But for such a Damascene conversion to happen, the country would have to experience a political or economic crisis large enough to shake public opinion out of its fatalistic complacency.
As things stand, Britons have been emulating that beloved national slogan, “Keep calm and carry on.”
Before things can get better for Britain, they will probably have to get much worse.
How Money Could Unblock the Brexit Talks
LONDON – Like many divorce proceedings, Britain’s negotiations with the European Union have reached an impasse that can be broken only by compromise.
The solution is for both sides to admit that a permanent new relationship cannot be agreed in the short time remaining until the Brexit deadline in March 2019.
So, instead of letting the United Kingdom crash out of the EU then, the talks should now shift to the temporary “transition” that Prime Minister Theresa May officially requested last month – and which a strong consensus among Britain’s business leaders and public now demands.
Above all, the negotiators should focus immediately on the British budget contributions that will be required to make an orderly transition possible.
An agreement on a mutually beneficial transition would require some compromises from both sides.
But neither Britain nor the EU would have to abandon any fundamental principles.
For Europe, shifting the focus of negotiations to a temporary agreement, probably modeled on the EU’s relationship with Norway, would involve only a small loss of face: EU leaders would have to concede that the sequencing they originally proposed for the Brexit talks had to be rejigged.
Instead of agreeing on a financial settlement first, and then moving on to trade relations, finance and trade would have to be acknowledged as interdependent – and thus be discussed simultaneously.
For Britain, a change of focus from permanent arrangements to the conditions for an orderly transition could transform the budgetary issues now preventing progress into a key that could unlock the talks.
In a speech delivered in Florence last month, May offered to make EU budget contributions of roughly €10 billion ($11.8 billion) annually for a transition period of at least two years after the Brexit deadline, as well as to maintain free movement of labor and enforce all EU rules.
May hoped that her promise would win over European leaders – especially the biggest contributor, Germany, and the big net recipients, such as Poland and Portugal.
But her offer failed to impress, probably because EU leaders are less worried about the financial hole created by Brexit in 2019 and 2020 than they are about the next budget cycle, from 2021 to 2026.
To suggest that Britain should pay budget contributions well into the next decade may seem completely unrealistic, given the vehement opposition to all EU payments from Euroskeptics in May’s Conservative Party.
But, on closer inspection, making a long-term budget offer could have two big advantages for May.
First, transitional budget contributions could be presented as commercial payments to support European programs from which Britain benefits, instead of the punitive-sounding “divorce settlement” of €50-60 billion currently demanded by the EU.
If Britain’s transitional payments continued near the current level of €10 billion for the five or six years realistically required to negotiate a permanent trading relationship, they would add up to the same amount.
Second, a British budget offer would be a powerful tool to create the “deep and special partnership” with Europe that May claims is her ultimate goal.
Until last month, May avoided defining this phrase, for fear of antagonizing her party’s hardline Europhobes.
But in her Florence speech, May promised British businesses something close to the current level of access to EU markets.
She also recognized that any privileged access to EU markets would require budget contributions, as in the case of Norway and Switzerland.
The implication was clear: something close to the current level of access to EU markets would demand something close to the current level of budget contributions.
And if May’s “deep and special partnership” is to be a permanent feature of British-EU relations, the budgetary contributions will have to be permanent, too.
But what if May is not really serious about that “deep and special partnership”?
What if her true objective is to satisfy Conservative hardliners by bringing about a “clean break”  with the EU?
Even then, Britain will need to continue paying budget contributions for many years, if it wants an orderly and non-disruptive Brexit.
Let’s assume that Britain’s ultimate aim is to create completely new global trading relationships, without any special EU trading privileges.
These new trade deals will take many years to negotiate, and until their completion, British businesses are desperate to avoid two costly disruptions: one when EU membership ends in March 2019, and another at whatever future date the new global trade agreements are finalized and come into effect.
Avoiding such a double disruption is the whole point of May’s proposal for a “standstill” transition period from 2019 to 2021.
But achieving that objective will require the standstill in Britain’s EU arrangements to continue until new global agreements are ready to implement.
This implies that Britain’s budget contributions must also continue until new global agreements are finalized.
The probability that complex negotiations with dozens of countries can be completed within just two years of Brexit is vanishingly small.
So, even if British politicians and voters really want a hard Brexit involving total rupture with Europe, UK businesses will need to preserve their special EU trading arrangements, along with the associated budget contributions, for at least several years beyond 2021.
The upshot is that, regardless of what type of Brexit the UK wants, any orderly withdrawal will require continued post-Brexit budget payments to the EU.
The only question is whether these payments turn out to be permanent, as they would if May really wants a “deep and special partnership,” or continue only for the 5-7 years required to negotiate new trade agreements after a hard Brexit.
Either way, May should recognize that EU budget payments will be inevitable for many years after Brexit.
More than that, she should turn this recognition into an impressive long-term financial offer to unblock the Brexit talks.
The Bloom Is off the BRICS
STANFORD – A few years ago, pundits and policymakers were predicting that the BRICS countries – Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa – would be the new engines of global growth.
Naive extrapolation of rapid growth led many people to imagine an ever-brighter future for these economies – and, thanks to them, for the rest of the world as well.
But now the bloom is off the rose.
The economies of Brazil and Russia are contracting, while those of China and South Africa have slowed substantially.
Only India’s growth rate has stayed up, now slightly exceeding China’s.
Will the BRICS fulfill their former promise?
Or are continued problems inevitable?
Given that low-income economies typically have little fixed capital (computers, factories, infrastructure) and human capital (education and training) per worker, they tend to have higher potential returns to capital investment.
That means they can grow more rapidly than wealthier economies, until their per capita income catches up.
While China, India, and Brazil still have very large rural populations, they have made great strides in reducing poverty, with several hundred million people (the largest proportion in China), escaping it in the last few decades.
And these countries’ middle classes are growing fast as well.
Rapid progress in the emerging economies has contributed to economic pessimism in Europe and North America.
After all, the developing economies’ combined GDP now exceeds that of the advanced economies – a situation that would have been unimaginable a generation ago.
Moreover, the hundreds of millions of low-cost workers who joined the global labor force when China, India, and Eastern Europe opened their economies are still putting pressure on the wages of all but the most skilled workers in the advanced economies.
As the Nobel laureate economist Paul Samuelson observed in 1948, international trade leads to factor-price equalization, with wages, adjusted for skill levels, equilibrating across countries.
But, for the BRICS, continued rapid progress may become more difficult.
Experience shows that there is a point – usually when per capita income levels reach about $15,000-20,000 (roughly one-third the level in the United States) – when growth tends to slow.
In recent decades, only a few economies – notably, South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore – have managed to escape the so-called “middle-income trap” and continue to increase their prosperity.
Beyond the problems that almost all developing economies confront – for example, weak institutions and poor governance – each of the BRICS countries faces a unique set of challenges.
For example, Brazil must contend with a recession, low oil prices, and an unprecedented corruption scandal at Petrobras, the state oil company.
Given this, freer trade, such as with the NAFTA countries (Canada, the US, and Mexico), and more hospitable terms for foreign investment, especially in energy, should top President Dilma Rouseff’s agenda.
Russia, too, is feeling the pressure of lower oil prices, both on its current budget and in terms of its ability to pursue further energy-sector development.
Compounding the challenge are the economic sanctions imposed by the US and Europe in response to President Vladimir Putin’s aggressive policies toward Russia’s immediate neighborhood.
Finally, Russia has a staggering demographic problem, characterized by a shrinking population, life expectancy far below the advanced-country average, and a growing brain drain.
India, at least for the moment, has the best short-run economic conditions.
Inflation, a major threat to the economy until recently, is down under the guidance of the Reserve Bank of India’s governor, Raghuram Rajan.
And growth is projected at 7.5% for this year.
But India’s fiscal position remains challenging, and the country’s population, which will soon overtake China’s, remains mostly rural and impoverished.
Despite the looming challenges, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been slow to implement the promised economic reforms.
Indeed, although he has made some small improvements in regulation, privatization, and cash transfers to the poor, bolder land and labor-market reforms remain elusive.
China, for its part, is attempting a difficult economic rebalancing, from an export-led to a consumption-based growth model.
In poker terms, Chinese President Xi Jinping is attempting to pull an inside straight, gambling that a growing middle class will demand enough manufactured goods to prevent the economy’s immense excess capacity in basic industries from leading to widespread unemployment.
At under 40% of GDP – compared to at least 60% in advanced economies – Chinese household consumption certainly has space to grow.
But China’s economy remains prone to considerable risks.
As occurred in Japan decades ago, China is starting to face lower-cost competition, such as from Vietnam; its stock market is frothy; and Xi’s anti-corruption program, though popular with ordinary citizens, has led to widespread uncertainty about the “rules of the game.”
Finally, South Africa’s problems reflect a loss of confidence in the government, endemic corruption, massive infrastructure needs, and restrictive labor-market and foreign-investment regulation.
And, in terms of reform, President Jacob Zuma is not headed in the right direction.
The BRICS are – and always have been – subject to the same forces as other economies.
But, although they have increased their dependence on market forces, their governments continue to dictate too many major economic decisions, increasing the risk of imbalances or even crises.
Their ability to develop institutions that support greater economic freedom, with more reliance on market competition and less on government, will likely be the main determinant of their long-term success.
How Britain Could Change Its Mind About Brexit
LONDON – Will 2018 be the year when the United Kingdom changes its mind about leaving the European Union?
Conventional wisdom says that stopping Brexit is impossible.
But what did conventional wisdom say about Donald Trump?
Or Emmanuel Macron?
Or, for that matter, the original Brexit referendum?
In revolutionary times, events can go from impossible to inevitable without ever passing through improbable.
Brexit was such an event, and its reversal could be another.
Just ask Nigel Farage, the former UK Independence Party leader, who has suddenly said that the June 2016 Brexit referendum could be overturned.
“The Remain side are making all the running,” Farage warned his fellow hardline Leavers this weekend.
“They have a majority in parliament, and unless we get ourselves organized we could lose the historic victory that was Brexit.”
The votes for Brexit and Trump are often described today as an ineluctable result of deep socioeconomic factors like inequality or globalization.
In some ways, this description is right.
Political upheavals of some kind were to be expected after the 2008 economic crisis, as I have argued for years.
But there was nothing inevitable about the specific upheavals that happened.
Brexit, like Trump, was a contingent outcome of small perturbations in voter behavior.
If just 1.8% of Britons voted differently, Brexit would now be a forgotten joke-word.
If Hillary Clinton’s popular majority of three million votes was distributed slightly differently among the states, the phrase “President Trump” would be as laughable today as it was in January 2016.
To stop Brexit in the year ahead, four similarly modest shifts in behavior need to happen.
Public opinion must shift slightly further against the Brexit decision, which is already viewed as “wrong in hindsight” by a 4% point margin.
Politicians who privately detest Brexit must speak out publicly.
Reasoned opposition to government policies must be recognized again as a hallmark of democracy, not an act of treason.
And the sense that Brexit is inevitable must be dispelled.
These requirements are interdependent.
Politicians will speak out only if they sense public opinion shifting; but public opinion will shift only with credible political leadership.
Politicians are cowed into silence if all opposition is branded as anti-democratic.
And if Brexit appears inevitable, why should voters bother to think again?
The sense of inevitability, opinion polls and focus groups show, is the most important obstacle to a reversal.
About 30% of British voters oppose the EU so passionately that they will always back leaving, regardless of the economic costs, just as Trump’s “base” will always support “their” president regardless of how he behaves.
But these diehard Euroskeptics would never have won a majority without some 20% of voters who cared little about Europe, but treated the referendum as a protest vote.
Many of these low-conviction voters are now dismayed that Brexit has distracted attention from their real grievances about health, inequality, low wages, housing, and other issues.
Yet, for this very reason, they want the inevitable departure from Europe to happen as quickly as possible so that the country can get back to business as usual.
Now suppose these voters began to believe that Brexit, far from being inevitable, might never happen.
They would demand that politicians “should stop banging on about Europe” and start dealing with the people’s real concerns.
The sense of inevitability could be dispelled by recent shifts in the internal politics of both the Conservative government and the Labour opposition.
Labour has begun to realize that its only possible route back to power is by opposing Brexit.
Detailed analysis of the 2017 election returns has shown that Labour’s unexpected gains were due almost entirely to affluent young voters whose motivation was the hope of derailing Brexit.
Had it not been for these anti-Brexit voters, Prime Minister Theresa May would have won the widely predicted landslide.
If Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, now becomes “the handmaiden of Brexit,” in Tony Blair’s memorable phrase, by shying away from effective opposition, these new voters will feel betrayed, the party will split between the Marxists and centrists, and its hopes of ever winning a general election will be dashed.
If, on the other hand, Labour decided to fight Brexit, public opinion would rapidly shift.
Opposition to Brexit would start to be treated as a natural feature of democratic politics.
Labour would start to benefit from the government’s negotiating blunders.
And the sense of Brexit’s inevitability would vanish.
That, in turn, would give courage to pro-European Conservatives.
Tory MPs are unlikely to vote against their party leadership if the absence of Labour opposition allows the government to win anyway.
If, however, concerted opposition from Labour created a genuine possibility of stopping Brexit, Tory MPs who put national interest ahead of party loyalty would find themselves praised for their mettle, not ridiculed for folly.
They might even calculate that their own careers would prosper if their party reconciled itself to Europe.
This chain of events now seems to be starting.
In December, May lost her first important Brexit battle, when Labour MPs united with 12 Tory rebels to pass an amendment requiring a specific Act of Parliament to approve whatever deal is negotiated with the EU.
This means that any Brexit plan that arouses serious opposition, either from hardline nationalists or from pro-European Tories, could be used to trigger a new referendum.
Following this breakthrough, the first serious cross-party campaign explicitly aiming to stop Brexit, and not merely to mitigate damage by seeking a “softer” divorce deal, will be launched later this month.
To succeed, this campaign will need to persuade disillusioned Remainers that Brexit is not inevitable.
It will need to show protest voters that whatever their problems, Brexit is not the answer.
It will need to convince Labour politicians that collaboration with Brexit is electoral suicide, and persuade pro-EU Tory rebels that a rebellion would not be futile.
Finally, it will need European leaders to state unequivocally that Britain is legally entitled to change its mind about leaving.
These requirements are challenging, but not impossible.
David Davis, the pro-Brexit Tory who is now leading the UK’s Brexit negotiations, once said that, “If a democracy cannot change its mind, it ceases to be a democracy.”
Britain is still a democracy, and it can still change its mind about Brexit.
The British Leadership Disease
LONDON – Ethical political leadership is in short supply worldwide, from the United States to Turkey to the Philippines.
But perhaps the most striking instance of dishonest leadership has been in the United Kingdom, where the Brexit referendum and its aftermath have caused more instability than Britain experiences in a typical decade.
In just the first couple of weeks after the referendum, David Cameron, the prime minister who brought about the vote, resigned, and his Conservative successor, Theresa May, appointed a new Cabinet.
Though some of the Brexiteers – most notably former London Mayor Boris Johnson – are now in the government, none of those who led the campaign to leave the European Union are ultimately responsible for carrying it out.
May herself supported the “Remain” campaign.
Meanwhile, the opposition Labour Party has fallen into disarray.
Almost the entire Shadow Cabinet has resigned, having lost confidence in party leader Jeremy Corbyn, and efforts to challenge him have been exceptionally acrimonious, with Corbyn supporters even throwing a brick through the window of one of his rivals' constituency office.
And the post-referendum turmoil runs deeper.
The number of reported hate crimes since the referendum has soared by 500%, amid a lowering mood of social, political, and economic uncertainty and discontent.
More than £100 billion ($131 billion) was wiped off the FTSE 100 in the first ten minutes of trading after the result was announced, while the pound has plumbed a 35-year low against the US dollar.
One of the most striking lessons of the British case – and many others – is that promising efforts to hold business leaders to account and ensure that companies behave ethically have not carried over to our political systems.
Our elected leaders, often among the first to demand sound strategy, succession planning, and accountability in the private sector, have spectacularly failed to practice what they preach.
We expect business leaders to plan for the certainty of uncertainty and to manage risks properly.
In the past year, companies big and small in the UK, elsewhere in the EU, and around the world have held countless meetings and high-level planning sessions to prepare for a Brexit vote.
When the results came in, it seemed that the only people who hadn’t planned for the “Leave” campaign’s victory were those who led it.
Indeed, according to a recent report by Parliament’s foreign affairs select committee, Cameron’s “considered view not to instruct key departments including the Foreign Office to plan for the possibility that the electorate would vote to leave the EU amounted to gross negligence.”
The only UK political leader who quickly stepped forward with a clear and decisive strategy was Scotland’s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon.
Her plan is to hold another referendum on Scottish independence and rejoin the EU.
And it was an unelected Canadian, Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, whose authoritative reassurance helped to calm the markets.
In 2015, Carney came under fire for forming a committee to carry out forward planning for the possibility of Brexit.
And in early July, he was called to testify before the House of Commons Treasury Committee, accused of leaning toward “Remain” in the run-up to the referendum, simply because he presented a bleak (and accurate) assessment of the economic consequences of a Leave victory.
When Nigel Farage, one of the Leave campaign’s most vociferous and extreme leaders, decided to step down as leader of the UK Independence Party on July 4, he said, “I want my life back.”
If that sounds familiar, it is because Tony Hayward, then-CEO of BP, used the same phrase when talking about the impact – on him – of the 2010 oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.
When Hayward said it, the condemnation was swift.
His words conveyed a complete lack of empathy for the people who were actually affected by the spill.
Likewise, Farage, having helped drive Britain to disaster, blithely walked away when the destination was reached.
As mortifying as it is to see Johnson appointed Foreign Secretary, given his history of lying, xenophobic statements, and insulting remarks about other world leaders, at least he will bear the stain of Britain’s catastrophe publicly.
The deeper problem in the UK is that there is no alternative.
The Labour Party is simply too divided to take power.
If Corbyn were a CEO who lost the confidence of his entire executive team and board, he would be forced to resign or be fired.
If a CEO can’t command the respect of his leadership team, he can’t lead the company to success, even if most of the employees think he’s great.
The same is true of political parties, though they often take longer to act, causing the enterprise – in this case, the UK – to flounder.
With very few exceptions, the Brexit vote has brought out the worst in Britain’s leaders.
If a CEO lied to investors and consumers as much as Farage, Johnson, and Michael Gove lied to UK voters, the consequences would be swift and painful, both from regulators and the market.
They could not simply resign and move on, much less receive a future role in the organization (and certainly not a senior post).
They would be fined (or worse), professionally ostracized, and sent packing to Florida.
When we can hold our business leaders to account more effectively than we can our elected political leaders, we should worry for the future – and not just in the UK.
If it can happen here – in the homeland of Edmund Burke and Tony Benn – it truly can happen anywhere.
When Welfare Sabotages Lives
OXFORD – As Christmas approaches, the United Kingdom is accelerating the rollout of a social security scheme only Ebenezer Scrooge could love.
The “universal credit” program replaces six different welfare benefits – such as the child tax credit and the housing benefit – with one.
The goal is to incentivize employment, and to create an online system that is easier to use.
That’s the idea, anyway.
Unfortunately, the new system’s rollout has been rocky.
A minimum 42-day wait for the first payment has meant that some families have been left penniless for as long as six weeks.
When money has arrived, many recipients have found that their benefits have been reduced.
And in areas where universal credit has been widely implemented, referrals to food banks are increasing, as are evictions.
But, for all the dramatic headlines, there is a deeper, unreported problem with the UK’s welfare reform: rather than reduce poverty, it could actually exacerbate it.
In their pioneering 2013 book Scarcity: Why Having Too Little Means So Much, Harvard’s Sendhil Mullainathan and Eldar Shafir of Princeton University examined the conditions under which people make decisions regarding how they manage their jobs, families, and lives.
Their study holds two lessons that should be considered in evaluating the latest overhaul of the UK’s welfare system.
The first lesson is that people – rich and poor – often make bad choices when they lack a key resource, like money or time.
For example, ruinously expensive “payday loans” can be appealing to cash-strapped borrowers, even if the terms of these loans tend to push people deeper into debt.
This is not because people lack education.
In controlled studies, Mullainathan and Shafir asked Princeton University students to play a timed computer game in which they were given the opportunity to “borrow” extra seconds, even though doing so would mean forfeiting double the number of seconds from their overall time.
Many took the opportunity, leading Mullainathan and Shafir to conclude that poor decisions can result from conditions of scarcity and stress.
Britain’s latest welfare reforms will push many recipients into a similar calculus, given that many of the poor have had their support reduced.
This was not the original goal of the “universal credit” system, but a government seeking to cut spending found slashing welfare to be irresistible.
The result is a system that is £3 billion ($4 billion) less generous than the system it replaces.
It is estimated that some 1.1 million two-parent families will lose an average of £2,770 per year, while working single parents will lose an average of £1,350 per year.
These reductions in benefits are likely to perpetuate a cycle of bad planning and decision-making.
It is a vicious cycle; the more the poor are deprived of resources, the more damaging their decisions can become.
A second lesson from Shafir and Mullainathan applies to the limits of human “bandwidth.”
We all know that drivers using mobile phones are far more likely to have accidents, or that students using laptops during lectures learn less.
If people’s brainpower is distracted by a pressing concern, they perform worse in problem-solving situations.
Britain’s benefit system operates in a similar fashion; it is a voracious consumer of bandwidth.
For example, the predecessor to the universal credit scheme, the Welfare Reform Act of 2012, created caps to local housing allowances and total benefits, and under-occupancy penalties.
Disability benefits and eligibility tests were also dramatically changed.
And all of these “improvements” followed dozens of other changes, creating a maelstrom of bureaucracy that strained bandwidth and tested resolve.
Now come the new changes, which, in effect, create debilitating distractions for beneficiaries, forcing the poor to spend even more mental energy navigating yet another system, with new rules and procedures.
This is akin to forcing people to use mobile phones every time they drive.
It is unclear how parents and workers navigating a system intended to “make work pay” are supposed to perform either role well.
Britain’s new program was championed as a way to reduce costs and incentivize better decisions, thereby moving more people into work and reducing benefit claims.
But, so far, there is little evidence to support this rosy scenario.
By reducing benefits received by the poor, the government is ensuring that scarcity surges and poor decisions multiply.
And by changing the system frequently and making it more complicated to access, Britain’s leaders are also forcing the poor to consume more mental bandwidth.
Taken together, these factors are leaving welfare recipients worse off.
Policymakers should read Mullainathan and Shafir, and consider how their research could be applied to future welfare reforms.
The goal should be benefits that are generous and stable enough to let people focus on finding work, while also helping their children with homework and looking after their own health.
That type of system is possible to create.
The alternative is a system that places additional burdens on those least able to bear them.
A Better Way from ‘R’ to ‘D’
BELLEVUE, WASHINGTON – When business leaders get together to talk about innovating their industries, they typically focus on initiatives like improving government funding for basic research, or building technology hubs and incubators.
But a crucial element of “innovation” is often absent from these discussions: the final products.
That’s no oversight.
On the contrary, the lack of product-focused discussion is symptomatic of a far more serious problem facing businesses of all sizes in nearly every industry.
Simply put, product development takes a back seat in innovation strategy because the financial link between ideation and commercialization is broken.
For economies to prosper, good ideas need a nudge getting to market.
Innovative products are, after all, what makes life healthier, more efficient, and more fun.
But there’s ample evidence to suggest that development – the “D” in R&D – has not kept pace with the blistering speed of “R” – modern-day research.
Even the most robust economies have a surplus of ideas that never reach consumers.
In the US, for example, just 5% of all active patents are ever licensed or commercialized.
Most companies use less than a quarter of the inventions they own.
Technology transfers from academia aren’t going so well, either.
Although more than 75,000 patents have been issued to American universities since 1969, the vast majority of technology transfer offices – administrative units that manage a school’s intellectual-property output – are failing to generate enough revenue even to cover their operating costs.
If we want to reverse these trends and maximize innovation output, we need more mechanisms for funding the commercialization of smart ideas.
At the moment, venture capital-backed startups are the standard mechanism for moving from “R” to “D.”
These companies are formed for the sole purpose of pushing good ideas through the development pipeline.
And, given the stellar valuations of some startups, it’s easy to assume that a healthy ecosystem of savvy companies and venture capital funding is all that is needed to ensure innovation.
But most companies are simply unable to take good ideas to market, because they lack access to pools of capital earmarked for innovation.
Small- and medium-size enterprises (SMEs) often struggle to secure financing to build R&D infrastructure.
Multinational corporations use retained earnings to finance R&D, but because this approach can adversely affect a company’s stock valuation, even they tend to be conservative in pushing new ideas forward.
Compare that scenario with the way that multinationals finance infrastructure investments.
Let’s say, for example, that DuPont wanted to build a new manufacturing facility.
It could borrow money from a bank and repay it from resulting profits.
But if DuPont needed capital to produce a new chemical in an existing plant, it couldn’t get a loan, because banks don’t know how to assess the risks of innovative products (in the chemical industry or any other).
Unless you’re a giant like Alphabet, Apple, or Tesla, you can’t justify the risk and expense of a blue-sky R&D program.
These days even the biggest companies are more likely to acquire a new, pre-packaged technology than to develop it in-house.
That’s one reason why mergers and acquisitions are increasingly common (and why some observers see M&As as the new R&D).
This situation isn’t ideal for investors, either.
Consider the case of Sony’s PlayStation gaming console.
Development of the PlayStation attracted considerable attention from investors in the 1990s.
But the only way to back the project was to buy shares in the parent company—which encompassed music, film, camera, and television businesses as well.
This sort of misalignment is just as inefficient for companies as it is for investors.
And it’s not even an option for smaller companies; selling equity is hard when you’re an SME.
Clearly, current funding models stifle product-specific innovation and investment, and all but freeze out SMEs.
The government officials with whom I speak are more concerned with maintaining the health of their countries’ SMEs than protecting multinational corporations, for good reason: SMEs everywhere account for an overwhelming share of employment and job creation.
Yet they aren’t getting the financing opportunities they deserve.
To turn things around, businesses need financing vehicles tied to product development.
One idea is debt-based funds offering bonds with more predictable returns based on revenue from new products.
These funds could be structured to distribute risk among a variety of projects or sectors, which might make them more attractive to investors who avoid high-stakes venture financing.
This kind of funding would also enable much closer alignment between investors and innovative projects.
Companies with proven track records, technical skills, experienced management teams, and established sales channels are sources of innovation that no country can afford to squander.
The limitations of the current financing regime mean that countries are letting opportunity pass them by.
Despite few ready avenues for product commercialization, the world’s companies, research institutes, and university and government laboratories together spend more than a trillion dollars on R&D annually.
Without a new approach to product financing, most of what they discover will remain on the shelf.
Bubble Trouble
The future of the housing boom, and the possible financial repercussions of a substantial price decline in coming years, is a matter of mounting concern among governments around the world.
I learned this first-hand while attending this year’s Jackson Hole Symposium in the remote wilderness of Wyoming, where, ironically, there are almost no homes to buy.
The howls of coyotes and bugling of elk rang out at night.
But, by day, everyone was talking about real estate.
This conference has grown to be a major international event for government monetary policymakers, with governors or deputy governors of 34 central banks attending this year.
Roughly two-thirds of these countries have had dramatic housing booms since 2000, most of which appear to be continuing, at least for the time being.
But there was no consensus on the longer-run outlook for home prices.
Of all these countries, the United States appears to be the most likely to have reached the end of the cycle.
According to the Standard & Poor’s/Case-Shiller US National Home Price Index, US home prices increased 86% in real, inflation-corrected, terms from 1996 to 2006, but have since fallen 6.5% – and the rate of decrease has been accelerating.
That looks like the beginning of the end of the boom, though, of course, one can never be sure.
I presented a bearish long-run view, which many challenged, but no one obviously won the argument.
Nevertheless, an outside observer might have been struck by the weight given to the possibility that the decade-long boom might well suffer a real reversal, followed by serious declines.
There seems to be a general recognition of substantial downside risk, as the current credit crisis seems to be related to the decline in US home prices that we have already seen.
The boom, and the widespread conviction that home prices could only go higher, led to a weakening of lending standards.
Mortgage lenders seem to have believed that home buyers would not default, because rising prices would make keeping up with their payments very attractive.
Moreover, the boom resulted in a number of financial innovations, which may have been good ideas intrinsically, but which were sometimes applied too aggressively, given the risk of falling prices.
Mortgage-backed securities were urged onto investors for whom they were too risky.
As with homebuyers, all would be well, the reasoning went, on the premise that home prices continue to rise at a healthy pace.
At the Jackson Hole conference, Paul McCulley of PIMCO, the world’s largest bond fund, argued that in the past month or two we have been witnessing a run on what he calls the “shadow banking system,” which consists of all the levered investment conduits, vehicles and structures that have sprung up along with the housing boom.
The shadow banking system, which is beyond the reach of bank regulators and deposit insurance, fed the boom in home prices by helping provide more credit to buyers.
Bank runs occur when people, worried that their deposits will not be honored, hastily withdraw their money, thereby creating the very bankruptcy that they feared.
It is no coincidence that this new kind of bank run originated in the US, which is the clearest example of falling home prices in the world today.
When home prices stop rising, recent homebuyers may lose the enthusiasm to continue paying their mortgages – and investors lose faith in mortgage-backed securities.
The US Federal Reserve is sometimes blamed for the current mortgage crisis, because excessively loose monetary policy allegedly fueled the price boom that preceded it.
Indeed, the real (inflation-corrected) federal funds rate was negative for 31 months, from October 2002 to April 2005.
The only precedent for this since 1950 was the 37-month period from September 1974 to September 1977, which launched the worst inflation the US has seen in the last century.
What then helped produce a boom in consumer prices now contributed to a boom in home prices.
But loose monetary policy is not the whole story.
The unusually low real funds rate came after the US housing boom was already well underway.
According to the Standard & Poor’s/Case-Shiller US National Home Price Index, home prices were already rising at almost 10% a year in 2000 – a time when the Fed was raising the federal funds rate, which peaked at 6.5%.
The rapid increase thus appears to be mostly the result of speculative momentum that occurred before the interest-rate cuts.
Alan Greenspan, the former Fed chairman, recently said that he now believes that speculative bubbles are important driving forces in our economy, but that, at the same time, the world’s monetary authorities cannot control bubbles.
He is mostly right: the best thing that monetary authorities could have done, given their other priorities and concerns, is to lean against the real estate bubble, not stop it from inflating.
The current decline in home prices is associated just as clearly with waning speculative enthusiasm among investors, which is likewise largely unrelated to monetary policy.
The world’s monetary authorities will have trouble stopping this decline, and much of the attendant problems, just as they would have had trouble stopping the ascent that preceded it.
Who Does Business Represent?
CAMBRIDGE – On whose behalf do business associations speak?
Well, business.
But who is “business”?
It’s an increasingly urgent question, because while firms have radically changed how they think about themselves, business associations have yet to catch up.
And the resulting lag is making capitalism less legitimate in many countries.
The traditional view of the firm – shared by both Karl Marx and Milton Friedman – is that it is an organization owned by capitalists (shareholders), on whose behalf it is run.
It hires workers and buys other inputs to maximize returns for those who put up the money.
According to Friedman, the social responsibility of the firm is to increase profits.
Any goal that does not directly benefit shareholders is just another distortionary tax.
But what makes all of a firm’s stakeholders behave in a way that maximizes value?
In fact, modern corporations struggle to create a sense of a collaborative community of employees, managers, suppliers, lenders, distributors, service providers, customers, and shareholders, all cooperating to create value by better satisfying customer needs and aspirations.
That’s why United Airlines would prefer that its employees treat passengers with grace.
Or why Goldman Sachs wishes its bankers would not aid and abet massive corruption.
Apple expects its suppliers to treat their workers humanely.
UnitedHealthcare hopes its employees manage reimbursements honestly.
Uber’s shareholders worry that misbehavior by senior executives may cause customers to switch service providers and valuable workers to quit.
To create functioning collaborative organizations, humans have evolved a sense of “us,” a feeling of belonging to what the historian and political scientist Benedict Anderson famously called an “imagined community.”
We owe such communities our loyalty, and we feel pride in their achievements, pain in their stumbles, and hope for their continued success.
We cooperate not just because it is in our cold pecuniary interest to do so, but because a cocktail of moral sentiments – loyalty, pride, guilt, shame, outrage, glee – make us work and root for our team.
Anderson’s focus was the rise of nationalism.
But corporations try to create an analogous sense of allegiance by specifying their mission, vision, and values in lofty terms.
When Chase Manhattan Bank bought J.P. Morgan in 2000, its managers assumed that they had also acquired the right to rename the organization.
They soon discovered that J.P. Morgan was a more prestigious imagined community than Chase in the eyes of its customers and employees.
It is easy to see why the vision of the firm as a collaborative community is winning out in business schools and the most successful companies.
One reason is that in most publicly traded corporations, shareholders are passive investors who just want to know enough about the firm to decide whether to buy or sell; they do not want to get involved in decisions.
At the same time, creating a sense of allegiance and trust by stakeholders facilitates running the show.
A narrow focus on shareholders’ interests would impel all other stakeholders to pursue their narrow interests as well, increasing strife and transaction costs.
The CEO may be appointed by a board of directors whose members are chosen by the shareholders, but he or she is supposed to represent and motivate the network of stakeholders that underpin the corporation’s success.
The Fellows of the Harvard Corporation appoint my employer’s president, but they try to choose someone who will make us stakeholders proud.
And yet the social and political representation of business more closely resembles Friedman’s archetype.
Business associations too frequently speak only on behalf of the narrow interest of the capitalist owners.
In country after country – whether in Argentina, Chile, Colombia, France, Mexico, or the United Kingdom – business organizations give political voice to employers, not to the network of stakeholders.
Political representation of business per se, if well conceived, is invaluable for society.
After all, economic progress requires that the invisible hand of the market be coordinated with the visible hand of the state.
The cellphone industry requires the creation of property rights on the spectrum.
The real estate industry needs to convince customers that their apartment building will not burn down.
The IT industry would benefit if kids learned to code in school.
As these and many other examples show, business can become more efficient if governments provide the right combination of a diverse, relatively specific, and evolving set of public goods.
Business associations need to interact with government in order to identify those public goods that would make economic ecosystems more productive, so that they can create more value for stakeholders.
But that task is burdened by the perception that those at the table are there to represent employers’ narrow interests, as their policy agenda – often focused on shifting the burden of taxation onto others – clearly suggests.
As a consequence, governments often require that they meet in the presence of labor associations, so that employees also get a voice.
Setting the table in this tripartite way dramatically changes the nature of the conversation, by focusing it on labor and other distributive issues that could be resolved within the business network, at the expense of addressing how to supply productivity-enhancing public goods that could benefit all stakeholders.
And it happens because the transformation in the conception of what a business is has yet to be reflected in the conception of what a business association should be.
Naturally, this lag leads to confrontation with other stakeholders, who must respond with their respective organizations.
But if business associations could transform themselves so that they represented and gave voice to the network of stakeholders on which businesses are actually built, they could contribute enormously to the creation of a much more collaborative and inclusive society.
The Trumping of Cambodian Democracy
WASHINGTON, DC – Over the last year, Cambodia’s ruling party, the Cambodian People’s Party (CPP), has dramatically increased its pressure on its political opponents and civil society.
Democracy in Cambodia has always been fraught, and elections are not completely free and fair.
But the current crackdown is much greater in scope, and far more concerning, in part because it is being enabled by American apathy.
Prime Minister Hun Sen, East Asia’s longest-serving non-royal ruler, has used his power to silence critics and close outspoken media outlets, including one independent newspaper, the Cambodia Daily.The CPP has also expelled the National Democratic Institute, a US-based nonprofit that focuses on rights and democracy, and detained political challengers.
Kem Sokha, who co-headed the main opposition group, the Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP), was arrested in September on dubious treason charges.
The other main opposition figure, Sam Rainsy, remains in exile in France.
But in recent weeks, Hun Sen has increased the pressure, essentially ending Cambodia’s shaky attempts at democracy.
Earlier this month, a court dominated by CPP allies dissolved the CNRP.
As a result, the party will most likely be unable to contest national elections next year, all but ensuring that Hun Sen will win another term as prime minister.
The ruling could also help enable Hun Sen eventually hand power to another family member.
Fearing for their lives, around half of CNRP lawmakers have left Cambodia.
Hun Sen has hardly been shy about his slide toward what the Cambodia Daily, on its last day of publishing, termed a “descent into outright dictatorship.”
In fact, Hun Sen, like other Southeast Asian autocrats, now seems to believe that he has political carte blanche, given the low priority that US President Donald Trump has placed on human rights.
In the past, Western pressure had managed to keep Hun Sen in check.
Foreign aid, including from the US, accounts for as much as 40% of Cambodia’s national budget.
And, while President Barack Obama’s administration did expand cooperation with Cambodia, it also repeatedly raised the issue of human-rights abuses with Hun Sen, including during a tense visit by Obama to Phnom Penh in 2012.
The Trump administration has rolled back this pressure, and then some, by downplaying human rights and democracy promotion.
In an address to the United Nations General Assembly in September, Trump made clear that his priority would be sovereignty rather than rights.
Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, meanwhile, has even reportedly considered removing democracy promotion from the State Department’s mission.
Hun Sen recognized this shift almost immediately.
In February, he compared his disdain for Cambodia’s media to Trump’s distrust of the mainstream media in the US.
And although lower-ranking US officials, including the Senior Director for Asia on the National Security Council, have met with their Cambodian counterparts to press them on rights issues, Trump has said nothing negative about Hun Sen’s actions.
In a speech in early November, Hun Sen essentially praised Trump for his indifference and non-interventionism.
Other Southeast Asian autocrats, or elected leaders with autocratic tendencies, have also celebrated the arrival of Trump’s “America First” foreign policy.
Thai Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, who led a coup against an elected government three years ago, was welcomed at the White House this year.
So was Malaysian leader Najib Razak, whose wealth may be questioned by the US Justice Department as part of a wide-ranging investigation into fraud at a Malaysian sovereign wealth fund.
Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, meanwhile, held a friendly phone call with Trump back in April.
Trump praised the Philippine leader for his brutal, lawless “war on drugs,” in which, according to Human Rights Watch, more than 12,000 people have died.
During Trump’s visit to Manila in November, Duterte serenaded him with a song, and then Trump laughed when, in a joint appearance, his counterpart blasted the media, calling them “spies.”
(The Philippines is one of the most dangerous countries in the world to be a journalist, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.)
Trump later claimed he briefly mentioned human rights to Duterte, but a Philippine government spokesperson said the two had not discussed rights issues.
As Hun Sen, Duterte, and others have shown, the new US approach fosters impunity for autocratic leaders.
Although other donor countries, such as Canada and France, have at times spoken out against Hun Sen’s abuses, the US government, as the actor wielding the most leverage, has historically led the charge.
But the Trump administration’s see-no-evil approach hinders other countries’ ability to promote rights and democracy.
For example, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, in his own bilateral meeting with Duterte this month, did raise concerns about the drug war in the Philippines.
But without US support, Trudeau’s pressure lacked credible measures.
Trump’s policies are placing America’s long-term interests at risk.
As in Cambodia, many of Asia’s strongest supporters of democratic change are young men and women.
Opposition parties in Malaysia, Cambodia, and other Southeast Asian countries attract a high share of young people, as do many of the media organizations and civil-society groups now under pressure.
And, most important from the standpoint of national interest, the US has built its strongest partnerships in Asia with other democracies.
Policies that ignore human rights and democracy will not benefit the US or the region.
An “America First” approach that disregards these issues – in Cambodia or elsewhere – will only leave the US weaker in the end.
Can Trump Turn His Presidency Around?
STANFORD – The United States’ economy is growing at a modest pace, with low unemployment and inflation.
Normally, these conditions would strengthen a US president’s standing with the public.
And yet Donald Trump’s approval rating is well below 40%, as one would expect to see during a recession.
Of course, Trump’s true popularity may be a little higher than the polls suggest, given that the same surveys failed to predict his victory last November.
But even if Trump has maintained the support of his base, his post-inauguration honeymoon proved to be fleeting.
Now, he is starting to lose the support of Republicans who had hoped that he would smooth his rough edges and grow once in office.
So far, Trump has failed to deliver any major legislative policy achievements.
Nonetheless, he has helped the economy by rolling back President Barack Obama’s damaging regulatory and administrative diktats in areas such as energy, education, finance, and labor law.
Moreover, even congressional Republicans who have distanced themselves from Trump’s more extreme statements – some even before his inadequate response to the violence at a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia – still support his main policy proposals, and are relying on him to sign conservative legislation that Obama vetoed.
Whether Trump is in the Oval Office, on Air Force One, or at his Mar-a-Lago resort, he, like all presidents, resides in a giant bubble, where those around him usually tell him what he wants to hear.
That is why it is so important that presidents have aides and advisers, both in and out of the White House, who are willing to tell them when they are veering off course.
By publicly rebuking his aides, Trump has made it even more difficult, but also more necessary, for those around him to tell him what he needs to hear.
At this point, his administration’s top priority should be to develop more disciplined processes to ensure that the president is being given accurate information and effective policy options.
To that end, Trump’s decision to appoint John Kelly, a retired Marine Corps general, as White House Chief of Staff was an important first step.
So, too, were the decisions to push out his hard-edged chief strategist, Steve Bannon, and to carry out a deliberative Afghanistan policy review, which changed Trump’s mind about US policy there.
Kelly now fully controls the flow of information and people reaching the president.
But it remains to be seen if Trump himself can be more disciplined.
One rarely gets a second chance to make a first impression.
But such opportunities do sometimes present themselves for US presidents.
Bill Clinton’s administration began with a lack of discipline, a failed attempt at health-care reform, and a loss for the Democrats in the 1994 midterm elections.
But Clinton turned things around, appointing new aides, moving toward the political center, winning reelection in 1996, and working with a Republican-controlled Congress to balance the budget and reform welfare.
Similarly, Ronald Reagan endured large Republican losses in the 1982 midterm election.
At that time, the US was in a deep recession, owing to the Federal Reserve’s tough disinflation policy, which Reagan had supported.
But the economy made a strong recovery, helped by Reagan’s tax cuts and increased military spending.
In 1984, Reagan won an overwhelming reelection victory.
Jimmy Carter’s administration, by contrast, never overcame its problems, and is now regarded as a dismal failure.
Upon taking office, all US presidents soon realize that their domestic and economic policymaking authority is constrained by Congress and the courts, but that they have much more sway over foreign and national-security affairs.
Trump, for his part, has made a point of being more forceful than Obama with allies and foes on security matters.
With North Korea making alarming strides in its nuclear and intercontinental ballistic missile programs, Trump’s approach is undergoing its first real test.
Here, President John F. Kennedy during the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis provides the best analogy.
The Kennedy administration stumbled badly when it tried to destabilize Fidel Castro’s communist regime in Cuba – an effort that culminated in the Bay of Pigs fiasco.
But by standing firm against the Kremlin, Kennedy brought the crisis to a peaceful end: the Soviet Union removed its nuclear missiles from Cuba, and the US quietly removed its missiles from Turkey.
North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un is undoubtedly operating according to a different political calculus than the Soviets, and the strategic situation on the Korean Peninsula is even more daunting than in Cuba.
North Korea has a large conventional arsenal that could rain down havoc on ten million South Koreans in nearby Seoul.
Still, if Trump’s firm response ends up being successful, it could widen his appeal.
Trump’s actual decisions matter far more than his confrontational behavior.
But his behavior can still affect the options that are available to him.
If his public approval sinks too low, fewer members of Congress will work with him, and more will work against him.
Moreover, his remarkable penchant for overshadowing good news with unrelated Twitter attacks allows an overwhelmingly leftist, unsympathetic media to overemphasize his personality, while ignoring his administration’s substantive successes.
For example, earlier this month, while many were fixated on Trump’s rhetoric, US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson secured United Nations Security Council approval for increased sanctions on North Korea, and China said that it would curtail its imports from the North.
Soon thereafter, North Korea called off planned test launches of missiles that it had threatened to aim at the waters around the US territory of Guam.
Politically, America is deeply polarized.
But on most issues, Americans want commonsense solutions to real problems, with government playing a limited role in their lives.
Trump has an opportunity to cut taxes, improve US infrastructure, and replace or amend the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare).
To succeed, he needs to demonstrate respect for reasonable opposing viewpoints and tone down his more extreme positions to broaden his popular support.
But, above all, he needs to cooperate with Congress, just as Reagan and Clinton did.
If he does that, he could turn his presidency around, confound his critics, and leave a positive legacy.
Can he?
A Spanish Disquisition
GOTHENBURG – Within a few days, the Catalan regional parliament may declare Catalonia’s independence, after 500 years of history with Spain.
A few hours afterwards, the Spanish government may respond by sending thousands of police to detain top Catalan officials, putting an end to 40 years of prosperous self-rule.
In turn, many Catalans may take to the streets, launching a revolt with scary consequences.
At first sight, the idea that Spain could descend into chaos is puzzling.
The country is ranked among the world’s top-performing democracies – ahead of France, Italy, and the US according to some indicators.
And it is one of the favorite destinations for investors and tourists worldwide.
Having strolled through the magnificent and charming streets of Barcelona, the possibility of violent clashes there seems as unlikely as a guerrilla in the forests of British Columbia.
Nonetheless, a physical confrontation between the Spanish authorities and Catalan insurrectional forces is a possible outcome, unless the major actors change their course of action.
And none of them has incentives to do so.
Like James Dean and Buzz in “Rebel Without a Cause,” the Spanish and Catalan governments are speeding their cars toward a cliff, with each expecting the other to be the first to jump out.
The Spanish government assumes that Catalan’s parliament will not dare to declare independence unilaterally, because the move would receive no international recognition.
And the Catalan government is confident that a repressive response by the Spanish authorities, reviving the images of police beating unarmed old women and teenagers that the world saw during the referendum on October 1, would pave the way for a peaceful rebellion within Catalonia and widespread international acquiescence.
In addition, both governments enjoy strong popular support.
The ruling conservative People’s Party (PP) in Madrid can comfortably win a national election without courting voters in Catalonia, where it obtained a meager 11% of the vote in 2015.
Likewise, the separatist parties can easily secure a majority in the Catalan parliament.
Besides, thanks to governmental control of public broadcasters and generous public subsidies to private media outlets, both sides can deploy a reliable army of fiercely motivated journalists and intellectuals whose incendiary comments are contributing to the conflict’s escalation.
The actors in the Spanish drama are facing what political scientists call a social dilemma: either side gains from selfish behavior unless the other side behaves selfishly, too, in which case both sides lose.
Both unionists and separatists would be better off with a second-best solution.
For example, the separatists could renounce a unilateral declaration of independence in exchange for talks on constitutional reforms that would move Spain in a federal direction.
A constitutional amendment that allowed symbolic changes, like an official declaration of Catalonia as a “nation,” or substantive initiatives, like a fiscal pact, would satisfy most Catalans while maintaining Spain’s territorial integrity.
The problem is that both sides believe that showing willingness to compromise would weaken their future bargaining situation.
Research in political science, however, indicates that the opposite may be true.
Following insights by the Nobel laureate Elinor Ostrom, we know that social dilemmas can be solved using the inverse strategy: giving instead of demanding.
If one party exhibits cooperative behavior, its rival may feel forced to reciprocate, leading to a spiral of cooperation instead of retaliation, and of trust instead of suspicion.
This is what is required now in Catalonia.
Both the Spanish government and the Catalan separatists must acknowledge that, if they act with sensible generosity, the other side may respond with further concessions.
It will not be easy, given the current mental disconnect between the Madrid and Barcelona elites.
Yet they need to consider how their behavior is endangering the hard-earned welfare of millions of Spaniards, after four decades of successful democracy.
In sunny Spain, there should always be light at the end of the tunnel.
Spain’s Crisis is Europe’s Opportunity
ATHENS – To revive the ailing European project, the ugly conflict between Catalonia’s regional government and the Spanish state may be just what the doctor ordered.
A constitutional crisis in a major European Union member state creates a golden opportunity to reconfigure the democratic governance of regional, national, and European institutions, thereby delivering a defensible, and thus sustainable, EU.
The EU’s official reaction to the police violence witnessed during Catalonia’s independence referendum amounts to dereliction of duty.
To declare, as the President of the European Commission did, that this is an internal Spanish problem in which the EU has no say is hypocrisy on stilts.
Of course, hypocrisy has long been at the center of the EU’s behavior.
Its officials had no compunction about meddling in a member state’s internal affairs – say, to demand the removal of elected politicians for refusing to implement cuts in the pensions of their poorest citizens or to sell off public assets at ridiculous prices (something I have personally experienced).
But when the Hungarian and Polish governments explicitly renounce fundamental EU principles, non-interference suddenly became sacrosanct.
The Catalan question has deep historical roots, as does nationalism more broadly.
But would it have erupted the way it recently did had Europe not mishandled the eurozone crisis since 2010, imposing quasi-permanent stagnation on Spain and the rest of the European periphery while setting the stage for xenophobia and moral panic when refugees began crossing Europe’s external borders?
An example illustrates the connection.
Barcelona, Catalonia’s exquisite capital, is a rich city running a budget surplus.
Yet many of its citizens recently faced eviction by Spanish banks that had been bailed out by their taxes.
The result was the formation of a civic movement that in June 2015 succeeded in electing Ada Colau as Barcelona’s mayor.
Among Colau’s commitments to the people of Barcelona was a local tax cut for small businesses and households, assistance to the poor, and the construction of housing for 15,000 refugees – a large share of the total number that Spain was meant to absorb from frontline states like Greece and Italy.
All of this could be achieved while keeping the city’s books in the black, simply by reducing the municipal budget surplus.
Alas, Colau soon realized that she faced insurmountable obstacles.
Spain’s central government, citing the state’s obligations to the EU’s austerity directives, had enacted legislation effectively banning any municipality from reducing its surplus.
At the same time, the central government barred entry to the 15,000 refugees for whom Colau had built excellent housing facilities.
To this day, the budget surplus prevails, the services and local tax cuts promised have not been delivered, and the social housing for refugees remains empty.
The path from this sorry state of affairs to the reinvigoration of Catalan separatism could not be clearer.
In any systemic crisis, the combination of austerity for the many, socialism for bankers, and strangulation of local democracy creates the hopelessness and discontent that are nationalism’s oxygen.
Progressive, anti-nationalist Catalans, like Colau, find themselves squeezed from both sides: the state’s authoritarian establishment, which uses the EU’s directives as a cover for its behavior, and a renaissance of radical parochialism, isolationism, and atavistic nativism.
Both reflect the failure to fulfill the promise of shared, pan-European prosperity.
Catalonia provides an excellent case study of Europe’s broader conundrum.
Choosing between an authoritarian Spanish state and a “make Catalonia great again” nationalism is equivalent to choosing between Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the President of the Eurogroup of eurozone finance ministers, and Marine Le Pen, the leader of France’s far-right National Front: austerity or disintegration.
The duty of progressive Europeans is to reject both: the deep establishment at the EU level and the competing nationalisms ravaging solidarity and common sense in member states like Spain.
The alternative is to Europeanize the solution to a problem caused largely by Europe’s systemic crisis.
Instead of impeding local and regional democratic governance, the EU should be fostering it.
The EU treaties could be amended to enshrine the right of regional governments and city councils, like Catalonia’s and Barcelona’s, to fiscal autonomy and even to their own fiscal money.
They could also be allowed to implement their own policies on refugees and migration.
If there was still demand for statehood and separation from the internationally recognized state to which they belong, the EU could invoke a code of conduct for secession.
For example, the EU could stipulate that it will sanction an independence referendum if the regional government requesting it has already won an election on such a platform with an absolute majority of the voters.
Moreover, the referendum should be held at least one year after the election, to allow for a proper, sober debate.
As for the new state, it should be obligated to maintain at least the same level of fiscal transfers as before.
Rich Veneto could secede from Italy, for example, as long as it maintained its fiscal transfers to the South.
Moreover, the new state should be prohibited from erecting new borders and be compelled to guarantee its residents the right to triple citizenship (new state, old state, and European).
The Catalonia crisis is a strong hint from history that Europe needs to develop a new type of sovereignty, one that strengthens cities and regions, dissolves national particularism, and upholds democratic norms.
The immediate beneficiaries would be Catalans, the people of Northern Ireland, and maybe the Scots (who would in this manner snatch an opportunity out of the jaws of Brexit).
But the longer-term beneficiary of this new type of sovereignty would be Europe as a whole.
Imagining a pan-European democracy is the prerequisite for imagining a Europe worth saving.
Why Catalonia’s Independence Bid Is Failing
BARCELONA – In the confusing aftermath of Catalonia’s messy independence referendum, the Catalan regional government’s president, Carles Puigdemont, has wanted to have his cake and eat it.
His long-awaited speech to the regional parliament, in which he had promised to declare independence from Spain, ended up being a muddled effort to placate his radical nationalist allies, the Popular Unity Candidacy (CUP), without further alienating the central government in Madrid.
He achieved neither objective.
Puigdemont did declare a Catalan state “in the form of a republic.”
But he immediately “suspended” the declaration to allow for negotiations with the Spanish government.
To the Spanish government, Puigdemont’s address was an implicit declaration of independence, and to the impatient CUP, it was a moment of inadmissible betrayal.
It is now highly probable that the central government will invoke Article 155 of the Spanish Constitution, which allows it to take direct control of Catalonia, a step that would undoubtedly provoke more civil unrest throughout the region.
Historically, national independence has usually been achieved through violent, even cataclysmic processes of decolonization.
New states have almost invariably been born in blood, sacrifice, and deprivation.
In the case of the former Yugoslavia, independent states emerged out of civil war and even genocide.
Enslaved nations have also recovered sovereignty through state failure and imperial collapse.
Amicable breakups, like that of Czechoslovakia, or of Norway and Sweden, are a historical rarity, however laudable.
Catalonia’s bid for independence, as Puigdemont probably knows, lacks the compelling revolutionary élan that has characterized struggling national movements throughout history.
Real, and sometimes imagined, grievances can explain the recent nationalist tide in Catalonia.
But the independence project mainly reflects Catalan elites’ extravagant dreams of grandeur and condescension toward the supposedly inferior Spaniards.
Those elites should now ask themselves whether their middle-class constituency is capable of enduring blockades, massive capital flight (which is already happening), a collapsing standard of living, and the enmity of both Spain and Europe.
In Iraq, the Kurds base their demand for independence on the claim that the Iraqi state is oppressive and failing.
But Catalonia is not an oppressed nation, and Spain is not a failed state.
Invoking Generalissimo Francisco Franco’s long dictatorship – now four decades in the past – is a feeble attempt to disguise the separatists’ economic pretensions and overblown sense of cultural superiority.
The West does not support Kurdish independence for the same reason it would not support Catalan independence.
Just as Spain is not an occupying power in Catalonia, the West does not regard the countries seeking to prevent Kurdish independence – Turkey, Iraq, Syria, and Iran – as true colonial powers.
Conversely, the cause of Palestinian independence is supported worldwide precisely because Israel is perceived as the last Western colonial power in Arab lands.
Such perceptions matter, because what frequently seals the fate of independence movements is the response of third countries.
And it is all but unimaginable that any European country would see any political advantage in facilitating Catalonia’s independence, which would alienate a key member of the European Union and boost myriad nationalist movements across the EU and in nearby states.
Catalonia does have a legitimate dispute with the Spanish government over finances and the attributes of autonomy.
But while the government in Madrid could have managed the Catalan conflict more wisely by addressing it politically, not just legally, the dispute comes nowhere near the threshold of justifying independence.
The “Catalan differential fact” is a historical reality; and it deserves to be addressed properly.
Yet the persistent move toward independence appears to be driven mostly by the excitement and kneejerk responses of some of Catalonia’s leaders.
At no point before or since the independence referendum have any of them offered an articulate explanation of why a separate Catalan state is necessary or what it would look like.
Would the Republic of Catalonia have its own armed forces?
Would its own national currency replace the euro?
How could it possibly persuade Spain and other EU member states not to veto its accession to the bloc?
Which countries would risk alienating Spain by recognizing an isolated Catalan state?
Invariably, unless nations march virtually united to independence, they don’t get there.
Catalonia is now almost evenly divided over the question, in a manner unseen since the Spanish Civil War.
Only 43% of Catalonia’s population voted in the referendum, which even Barcelona’s mayor, Ada Colau, a supporter of statehood, has questioned as a foundation for a unilateral declaration of independence.
Any vote not cast can legitimately be construed as a protest against the referendum – and a vote for unity with Spain.
Colau is right.
To say that the referendum produced a clear winner, and to base a declaration of independence on that vote, is a travesty of common sense and of democratic norms that would tarnish the nascent state as a grossly illegitimate enterprise.
Similar deep internal divisions doomed Quebec’s bid for independence – and Scotland’s as well.
Even the Confederate leaders at the time of the American Civil War understood that without a unified people fully behind their bid for independence, their slave-owner’s republic was doomed.
A shakeup of Spain’s political and constitutional status quo is long overdue, and the entire country could emerge stronger if the reforms enacted in response to the Catalonia crisis help unleash the energies of one of Europe’s most diverse nations.
But this is no time for petty minds and narrow visions.
The malignant effects of today’s identity politics should not be allowed to tear Spanish society apart in the way that ideological politics did 80 years ago.
What’s Really at Stake at the CCP Congress?
LONDON – This month, international media are understandably focused on the Chinese Communist Party’s 19th National Congress, a carefully choreographed event that will reveal who’s “in” and who’s “out” with Chinese President Xi Jinping.
But while it is important to know who Xi’s favorites are, I do not find the theater and intrigue of the event to be as interesting as it is made out to be.
Far more important is whether China’s leadership is acting in accordance with what the CCP has promised the country’s 1.3 billion people.
Just before the last congress, in 2012, Xi’s two-week absence from public view raised concerns.
In the unlikely event that the same thing happened again this year, alarm bells would have rung.
Moreover, if the agenda that Xi presents for the next five years suggests that he and the rest of the CCP leadership are losing credibility and struggling to maintain the party’s economic and social contract with the people, the 19th Congress will be very relevant.
But I doubt we should worry too much.
More pertinent questions come to mind – two in particular.
First, will the modest rise of the Chinese consumer continue to fuel 6-7% annual growth?
And, second, will the somewhat undefined Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) – continue to be a major priority for China’s leadership?
As for the first question, despite the slower growth trend this year, China will still add around $1 trillion or more to its nominal GDP, giving it a $12 trillion economy by the end of this year – nearly double the economy’s size in 2010.
To be sure, $12 trillion is just two-thirds the size of the US economy; but the $1 trillion added this year is more than all but the top 15 economies in the world.
It is larger than the entire GDP of Indonesia or Turkey, and almost as large as the Mexican economy.
According to official data, private consumption in China accounts for just 39.2% of GDP.
This is very low by the standards of most high-income economies, but it has increased from 35.5% of GDP in 2010.
When that increase is translated into hard numbers, it amounts to an additional $2.58 trillion since 2010 – an increment that is larger than the entire Indian economy.
The growth of Chinese consumption is easily the most important factor in global consumption growth today.
If Chinese consumption growth were to continue on its modest upward trajectory until 2020, it would account for just over 41.5% of GDP, which is to say, almost another $2 trillion.
And yet there is some anecdotal evidence to suggest that Chinese consumption growth might actually be accelerating faster.
So, the real question for China watchers around the world is whether anything that happens at the 19th Congress will affect this trend.
If the trend continues or accelerates, Chinese consumption could start to approach half that of the United States, which would be an extremely encouraging sign that the world economy is undergoing a badly needed rebalancing.
As for the second question, I suspect that China will stay the course on the BRI, especially given the growing concerns about trade elsewhere in the world.
While we don’t yet know the precise dynamics of this grand project, it is safe to assume that linking China, Europe, and everywhere in between through better infrastructure will have a significant positive impact on world trade.
To be clear, I do not think that the BRI is as important as the Chinese consumer to the world economy.
But in terms of trade, specifically, its impact could be enormous.
The BRI stands to have a direct effect on as many as 65 countries, including Russia and India, which along with China constitute three of the four BRIC countries (the other one is Brazil).
And nine of the 11 most populous emerging countries after China lie within the BRI’s broad geographical scope.
Most of these countries have not yet matched China’s success in unlocking their economic potential.
Many of them devote more resources to domestic infighting or conflict with one another than to participating in international trade.
But with BRI, cross-border trade could increase, and some of the feuds could be laid to rest, benefiting the region’s citizens.
Indeed, far more interesting than the BRI’s infrastructure projects are its geopolitical implications.
The BRI could subtly but significantly improve relationships between China and its neighbors, and between the neighbors themselves.
China’s relationship with India and other countries on the Indian subcontinent is of particular importance.
When Xi held a regional conference to promote the BRI in May, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi did not attend, much to Chinese leaders’ chagrin.
But then, at a BRICS summit in September, China and India seemed to achieve a significant diplomatic breakthrough over a territorial dispute.
If this turns out to be the beginning of a limited Sino-Indian rapprochement, and if other rivals in the region follow suit, then the BRI could end up being a landmark policy indeed.
So, when you are reading your favorite newspaper’s analysis of the CCP’s 19th National Congress, don’t be too distracted by the court intrigue.
The two questions that really matter are whether China’s consumer-led growth will stall; and whether the BRI will be abandoned.
Neither would be good for the global economy.
But, fortunately, neither seems likely.
Central Banks in the Dock
LONDON – On November 11, 1997, the Bank of England took a big step toward independence, courtesy of the second reading in the House of Commons of a bill amending the Bank Act of 1946.
The bill gave legislative affirmation to the decision, taken by then-Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown, to free central bank operations from governmental control.
This was a landmark event for an institution that had been under the yoke of government for a half-century. It symbolized how the need for central bank independence had become conventional wisdom.
Now, however, this wisdom is being questioned, and not just in the United Kingdom.
So long as inflation was the real and present danger, it made sense to delegate monetary policy to conservative central bankers insulated from pressure to finance government budget deficits.
Today, in contrast, the problem is the opposite, namely the inability of central banks to raise inflation to target levels.
To achieve this, it is necessary for monetary and fiscal policymakers to work together, including by allowing the central bank, in extremis, to monetize budget deficits.
But when it comes to cooperating with the fiscal authorities, central bank independence is a hindrance, not a help.
Independence was also easier to defend when central bankers’ task was limited to keeping inflation low and stable.
Given this narrow remit, the distributional consequences of central banks’ decisions were limited.
It was easier, moreover, to explain how a central bank’s policy instruments were linked to its politically mandated targets.
But after the global financial crisis highlighted the dangers of consigning monetary and fiscal policy to separate silos, central banks acquired additional responsibilities.
Deciding whether or not to rescue a specific financial institution, whether to ensure systemic stability or for other reasons, has visible consequences for individual investors.
The same is true of unconventional interventions in markets for corporate bonds and mortgage-backed securities.
Not surprisingly, the notion of independence for central banks that visibly aided specific financial institutions – and this at a time when society as a whole was under unprecedented economic stress – quickly became politically toxic.
Independence is even more problematic in an age when the cross-border spillovers of national monetary policies have become powerful.
Those spillovers make it important for central banks to take into account the impact of their policies on foreign countries and the global system.
But the pursuit of global objectives is difficult, bordering on the impossible, when central banks function under the kind of narrow, domestically focused mandates that independence requires.
Today, central banks are under attack for all of these reasons: for missing their inflation targets, for failing to maintain financial stability, for failing to restore stability in transparent ways, and for not adequately taking into account the global repercussions of their policies.
Dissatisfied by their performance, politicians are seeking to reassert control.
We hear the Bank of England criticized for voicing worries about the macroeconomic repercussions of Brexit. We encounter speculation that US President Donald Trump is intent on packing the Federal Reserve Board with politically compliant appointees.
But compromising central bank independence in order to enhance political accountability would be to throw the baby out with the bathwater.
Monetary policy is complex and technical. Returning control to politicians is no more prudent than handing them the keys to a country’s nuclear power plants.
Some will say that the way for central banks to ensure their independence is to abandon macroprudential and microprudential policies and foreswear unconventional interventions in securities markets.
But a key lesson of the crisis is that macroeconomic and financial policies are closely intertwined, and that their coordination is most effective when the two tasks are housed in the same institution, if run by separate committees.
Given the prevailing low level of interest rates, moreover, it is all but certain, come another crisis, that unconventional policies will be back.
What central banks can do to head off threats to their independence is become more transparent.
They can announce the votes of individual board members on all policy-relevant matters and release minutes without undue delay.
They can hold more press conferences and be less platitudinous in explaining their policies.
They can avoid pontificating on questions remote from their mandates.
They can acknowledge the right of politicians to define the goals the central bank is tasked with achieving.
And to shape the views of those politicians, they can better explain why cooperation with fiscal authorities and foreign central banks is in the public interest.
They can publish more detailed financial accounts, including on their individual security transactions and counterparties.
Above all, they can avoid intervening in parliamentary politics, as the European Central Bank did when it hastened the fall of Silvio Berlusconi’s government in Italy in 2011. Then they can keep their heads down and hope for the best.
The Dangerous Delusion of Price Stability
BASEL – The major central banks’ vigilant pursuit of positive but low inflation has become a dangerous delusion.
It is dangerous because the policies needed to achieve the objective could have unwanted side effects; and it is a delusion because there is currently no good reason to be pursuing the objective in the first place.
In the 1970s, when inflation in the advanced economies rose sharply, central banks rightly resisted it.
The lesson central bankers took from that battle was that low inflation is a necessary condition for sustained growth.
But, subtly and over time, this lesson has morphed into a belief that low inflation is also a sufficient condition for sustained growth.
That change may have been due to the benign economic conditions that accompanied the period of disinflation from the late 1980s to 2007, commonly referred to as the “Great Moderation.”
For central bankers, it was comforting to believe that they had reduced inflation by controlling demand, and that their policies had many beneficial side effects for the economy.
After all, this was the demand-oriented narrative they had used to justify tight money to begin with.
But then the world changed.
From the late 1980s onward, low inflation was largely due to positive supply-side shocks – such as the Baby Boomer-fueled expansion of the labor force and the integration of many emerging countries into the global trading system.
These forces boosted growth while lowering inflation.
And monetary policy, far from restricting demand, was generally focused on preventing below-target inflation.
As we now know, that led to a period of easy monetary conditions, which, together with financial deregulation and technological developments, sowed the seeds of the 2007 financial crisis and the ensuing recession.
The fundamental analytical error then – as it still is today – was a failure to distinguish between alternative sources of disinflation.
The end of the Great Moderation should have disabused policymakers of their belief that low inflation guarantees future economic stability.
If anything, the opposite has been true.
Having doubled down on their inflation targets, central banks have had to rely on an unprecedented array of untested policy instruments to achieve their goals.
For example, many central bankers are now recommending the use of “macroprudential” instruments to manage systemic risks in the economy – which, in turn, will allow them to keep interest rates “lower for longer.”
The problem with this approach is that there is little, if any, empirical evidence to suggest that such policies will work as intended.
Central bankers sometimes rationalize their current policies not by extolling the benefits of low inflation, but by underscoring the heavy costs of even mild deflation.
Yet while there is ample evidence showing that high inflation is more costly than low inflation, it is hard to find similar evidence that mild deflation is all that costly.
In fact, the widely held assumption that consumers and corporate investors will extrapolate from past price declines and hold off on making purchases as a result of deflation has essentially no empirical support behind it.
Recent consumer responses to sectoral price declines in various countries, not least Japan, all suggest the very opposite.
True, as a matter of arithmetic, deflation increases the real (inflation-adjusted) burden of debt service.
But if debt levels are at onerous heights as a result of easy-money monetary policies, it is not obvious that the solution to the problem is still more easy money.
Central banks’ fixation on positive but low inflation under today’s prevailing economic conditions is also increasingly dangerous.
Global debt ratios have risen sharply since the financial crisis began, while traditional lenders’ margins have been squeezed, raising questions about their overall health.
And as lending has continued to migrate further into the “shadows,” price discovery in financial markets has become severely compromised, to the point that many assets now seem to be overvalued.
These developments constitute a threat not just to financial stability, but also to the workings of the real economy.
Moreover, one could argue that easy money itself has contributed to the unexpectedly strong disinflationary forces seen in recent years.
Owing to easy financing and regulatory forbearance, aggregate supply has risen as “zombie” companies have proliferated.
Meanwhile, aggregate demand has been restrained by the debt headwinds – yet another result of easy monetary conditions.
In view of these conditions, continuing to insist on monetary easing seems particularly ill advised.
With so many potential dangers on the horizon, central bankers should at least consider rethinking the fundamental assumptions underlying their policies.
So, what should policymakers do?
In the immediate future, governments must stop relying so much on central bank policies to restore sustainable growth.
Rather than obsesses over inflation targets, policymakers should (belatedly) start asking themselves what practical measures they can take to prevent another crisis from erupting.
Equally important, they need to ensure that they have done everything they can to prepare for such a scenario, in case their preventive measures prove inadequate.
Looking even further into the future, when some semblance of “normality” has been restored, central banks should focus less on hitting near-term inflation targets, and more on avoiding “boom-bust” credit cycles.
Unlike slight deviations from inflation targets, or even slight deflation, the latter actually are costly.
Central Banking Goes Negative
NEW HAVEN – In what could well be a final act of desperation, central banks are abdicating effective control of the economies they have been entrusted to manage.
First came zero interest rates, then quantitative easing, and now negative interest rates – one futile attempt begetting another.
Just as the first two gambits failed to gain meaningful economic traction in chronically weak recoveries, the shift to negative rates will only compound the risks of financial instability and set the stage for the next crisis.
The adoption of negative interest rates – initially launched in Europe in 2014 and now embraced in Japan – represents a major turning point for central banking.
Previously, emphasis had been placed on boosting aggregate demand – primarily by lowering the cost of borrowing, but also by spurring wealth effects from appreciating financial assets.
But now, by imposing penalties on excess reserves left on deposit with central banks, negative interest rates drive stimulus through the supply side of the credit equation – in effect, urging banks to make new loans regardless of the demand for such funds.
This misses the essence of what is ailing a post-crisis world.
As Nomura economist Richard Koo has argued about Japan, the focus should be on the demand side of crisis-battered economies, where growth is impaired by a debt-rejection syndrome that invariably takes hold in the aftermath of a “balance sheet recession.”
Such impairment is global in scope.
It’s not just Japan, where the purportedly powerful impetus of Abenomics has failed to dislodge a struggling economy from 24 years of 0.8% inflation-adjusted GDP growth.
It’s also the US, where consumer demand – the epicenter of America’s Great Recession – remains stuck in an eight-year quagmire of just 1.5% average real growth.
Even worse is the eurozone, where real GDP growth has averaged just 0.1% over the 2008-2015 period.
All of this speaks to the impotence of central banks to jump-start aggregate demand in balance-sheet-constrained economies that have fallen into 1930s-style “liquidity traps.”
As Paul Krugman noted nearly 20 years ago, Japan exemplifies the modern-day incarnation of this dilemma.
When its equity and property bubbles burst in the early 1990s, the keiretsu system – “main banks” and their tightly connected nonbank corporates – imploded under the deadweight of excess leverage.
But the same was true for over-extended, saving-short American consumers – to say nothing of a eurozone that was basically a levered play on overly-inflated growth expectations in its peripheral economies – Portugal, Italy, Ireland, Greece, and Spain.
In all of these cases, balance-sheet repair preempted a resurgence of aggregate demand, and monetary stimulus was largely ineffective in sparking classic cyclical rebounds.
This could be the greatest failure of modern central banking.
Yet denial runs deep.
Former Federal Reserve Chair Alan Greenspan’s “mission accomplished” speech in early 2004 is an important case in point.
Greenspan took credit for using super-easy monetary policy to clean up the mess after the dot-com bubble burst in 2000, while insisting that the Fed should feel vindicated for not leaning against the speculative madness of the late 1990s.
That left Greenspan’s successor on a very slippery slope.
Quickly out of ammunition when the Great Crisis hit in late 2008, former Fed Chair Ben Bernanke embraced the new miracle drug of quantitative easing – a powerful antidote for markets in distress but ultimately an ineffective tool to plug the hole in consumer balance sheets and spark meaningful revival in aggregate demand.
European Central Bank President Mario Draghi’s famous 2012 promise to do “whatever it takes” to defend the euro took the ECB down the same path – first zero interest rates, then quantitative easing, now negative policy rates.
Similarly, Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda insists that so-called QQE (quantitative and qualitative easing) has ended a corrosive deflation – even though he has now opted for negative rates and pushed back the BOJ’s 2% inflation target to mid-2017.
It remains to be seen whether the Fed will resist the temptation of negative interest rates.
But most major central banks are clinging to the false belief that there is no difference between the efficacy of the conventional tactics of monetary policy – driven by adjustments in policy rates above the zero bound – and unconventional tools such as quantitative easing and negative interest rates.
Therein lies the problem.
In the era of conventional monetary policy, transmission channels were largely confined to borrowing costs and their associated impacts on credit-sensitive sectors of real economies, such as homebuilding, motor vehicles, and business capital spending.
As those sectors rose and fell in response to shifts in benchmark interest rates, repercussions throughout the system (so-called multiplier effects) were often reinforced by real and psychological gains in asset markets (wealth effects).
That was then.
In the brave new era of unconventional monetary policy, the transmission channel runs mainly through wealth effects from asset markets.
Two serious complications have arisen from this approach.
The first is that central banks have ignored the risks of financial instability.
Drawing false comfort from low inflation, overly accommodative monetary policies have led to massive bubbles in asset and credit markets, resulting in major distortions in real economies.
When the bubbles burst and pushed unbalanced economies into balance-sheet recessions, inflation-targeting central banks were already low on ammunition – taking them quickly into the murky realm of zero policy rates and the liquidity injections of quantitative easing.
Second, politicians, drawing false comfort from frothy asset markets, were less inclined to opt for fiscal stimulus – effectively closing off the only realistic escape route from a liquidity trap.
Lacking fiscal stimulus, central bankers keep upping the ante by injecting more liquidity into bubble-prone financial markets – failing to recognize that they are doing nothing more than “pushing on a string” as they did in the 1930s.
The shift to negative interest rates is all the more problematic.
Given persistent sluggish aggregate demand worldwide, a new set of risks is introduced by penalizing banks for not making new loans.
This is the functional equivalent of promoting another surge of “zombie lending” – the uneconomic loans made to insolvent Japanese borrowers in the 1990s.
Central banking, having lost its way, is in crisis.
Can the world economy be far behind?
Centrifugal and Centripetal Forces on Economic Areas
STANFORD – Several years ago, I predicted that there would be a tectonic shift toward devolution, secession, and independence around the world, owing to the failure of political institutions to manage economic, cultural, ethnic, and religious differences.
Supranational economic and political institutions were clearly generating a backlash, as they concentrated more power in central governments.
Citizens in many countries started to feel as though their sovereignty had been eroded.
And they worried that the costs of increasing immigration were too high, given the slow recovery from the Great Recession, weak productivity growth, and labor’s declining share of income.
Since then, the United Kingdom has decided to withdraw from the European Union.
“Divorce” discussions are now underway to determine how much the British will pay the EU, and what future trade relations will look like.
The process has not been easy, because EU negotiators are worried that if the exit terms are too generous, other member states might follow the UK out of the bloc.
Meanwhile, the United States, under President Donald Trump, has withdrawn from the Trans-Pacific Partnership and abandoned the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership with the EU.
Now it is threatening to withdraw from the North American Free Trade Agreement unless Mexico and Canada make concessions.
In Spain, on October 1, the government of the semi-autonomous region of Catalonia held a referendum in which an estimated 43% of Catalans took part, voting overwhelmingly for independence.
After the Catalan parliament declared independence, the Spanish national government invoked a constitutional provision to take administrative control of the region, escalating the crisis.
Not to be outdone, more than 90% of those who participated in recent referenda in Lombardy and Veneto, Italy’s two richest regions, voted for more control over local education spending and taxes.
Italy’s massive public debt and subsidies to poorer regions were certainly on these voters’ minds.
But Giuseppe Garibaldi, the general who united Italy’s city-states in the nineteenth century, must be turning over in his grave.
Elsewhere, Iraq’s Kurdistan Regional Government, having held an independence referendum in late September, is now trying to negotiate with the central government in Baghdad, which has sent troops to reclaim the region’s oil fields.
And Chinese President Xi Jinping used this month’s 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China to consolidate his position further, by shifting more power from the provinces to the central government in Beijing.
Even in countries long known for stability, there is a clear tension between centralized and decentralized political authority.
For example, a group called Calexit is trying to introduce a California ballot proposition to secede from the US.
According to early polls, one-third of Californians would support such an initiative.
And early this month, California Governor Jerry Brown signed a bill declaring California a “sanctuary state” – a mostly symbolic gesture indicating that the state will not fully cooperate with the Trump administration’s efforts to enforce federal immigration law.
At the national level, congressional Republicans’ ill-fated attempt to repeal and replace the 2010 Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) sought to shift more responsibility to the states through federal block grants.
And yet, the Republican tax-reform proposal that is now being discussed would eliminate a federal tax deduction for state and local taxes that other states consider a subsidy for high-tax states like California and New York. (Netting all the fiscal interactions and transfers, the reverse is closer to the truth.)
In Europe, the EU has continued to kick the can down the road, rather than deal with its crises in sovereign debt, banking, growth, and unemployment.
EU leaders are hoping that a modest cyclical upturn will buy them time.
But, at the end of the day, they will still have to confront a core problem: Germany, which has benefited the most from a monetary union in which its trading partners have no currency to depreciate, doesn’t want to foot the bill for bailing out profligate member states.
It may come as no surprise that a recent Pew Research Center poll found that 70% of Europeans, Canadians, and Americans favor more direct democracy, “in which citizens, rather than elected officials, vote on major issues.”
This would horrify America’s founders, who regarded direct democracy as a precursor to mob rule, and established a system of checks and balances precisely to prevent such an outcome.
Each of the aforementioned examples of centralization and devolution is unique. But it is worth asking if there are also commonalities among them.
When the Nobel laureate economist Robert Mundell, the intellectual “father of the euro,” set out to determine an optimal currency area, he put a premium on natural trade and macroeconomic ties.
As a Canadian, he was struck by the “horizontal” nature of the Canadian and American currency areas.
To his mind, “vertical” areas comprising the Canadian and American west might make more economic sense.
Mundell’s insight can be applied much more broadly.
Economic areas are continually forming, combining, and dissolving as a result of competing centrifugal and centripetal forces.
Constant shifts in comparative advantages, economies of scale, and transaction costs affect the benefits of accommodating more homogeneous localized preferences.
Likewise, “optimal” political areas change over time, owing to changes in technology and demography, and their interaction with evolving cultural, ethnic, religious, and other factors.
These processes of coming together and falling apart can be beneficial or harmful.
The EU has certainly been a great success as a trade area, but less so as an integrated labor market and currency union; and it has altogether failed as a banking and fiscal area.
Or consider the Indian subcontinent, where distrustful neighbors armed with nuclear warheads pose a danger to themselves and the world.
Given that India still has almost as many Muslims as Pakistan, it is possible that religious tensions could have been mitigated within the confines of a single country.
By my estimate, Pakistan and India’s current volume of trade should be 25 times higher than it is.
That would greatly benefit both countries, not least because they would each have a greater stake in the other’s success.
Governing well in a context of economic, political, ethnic, and religious diversity is not easy.
But failure to do so can mean substantially less growth – and substantially more political risk.
Are Nazis as American as Apple Pie?
NEW HAVEN – Is the United States threatened by Nazism?
The short answer is no, notwithstanding the frightening events in Charlottesville, Virginia, this past weekend.
In Charlottesville, the home of the University of Virginia, founded by Thomas Jefferson, white nationalists, separatists, neo-Nazis, members of the Ku Klux Klan, and other likeminded groups rallied behind Swastika banners and marched in a Nazi-style torchlight procession.
By the end of the next day, there had also been thuggish violence.
One white supremacist went so far as to drive a car into a crowd of counter-protestors, killing one and injuring 19 others.
The groups responsible for the violence in Charlottesville reveled in US President Donald Trump’s election last November.
And Trump has often hesitated to disavow them; during the election campaign, when former KKK Grand Wizard David Duke publicly backed him, Trump was scandalously slow to reject Duke and his followers.
Trump also repeatedly incited violence during the campaign, while evincing a bottomless affection for authoritarian leaders such as Russian President Vladimir Putin.
After the events in Charlottesville, Trump initially offered a bland statement that condemned hate “on many sides,” thereby drawing a moral equivalence between the racists and those who gathered to oppose them.
Two days later, under intensifying pressure, Trump issued a more forceful statement, in which he explicitly condemned the KKK, neo-Nazis, and other white supremacists, only to revert the following day to blaming “both sides” for the violence.
All of this is abhorrent.
But any sober observer can see that the US is still a long way from the nightmarish atmosphere of Germany in 1933.
American democratic institutions are holding up, just as they did in the crisis years of the 1930s.
Opposition parties have not been banned, and the courts have not lost their independent authority.
Moreover, Trump is not the supreme leader of a political party with a paramilitary arm.
There are no facilities such as Dachau, Auschwitz, or Treblinka under construction.
Even Trump’s planned border wall with Mexico remains stuck in the planning stage, with no funding from the US Congress.
And Congress is not about to pass an Enabling Act conferring dictatorial powers on the president, as the Reichstag did for Hitler in March 1933.
Last but not least, the American press is more tenacious and energized than it has been in years.
Trump’s yearning for authoritarian rule is clear for all to see.
But he will not achieve it.
There will be no Nazi dictatorship in America.
But whether America is threatened by such a dictatorship is not the right question.
American democratic institutions might be holding up, but history has taught us that they are not immune to the machinations of racially virulent political programs.
In fact, the US produced some of the laws that would later serve as a foundation for the Nazi movement in Germany.
America, with its vibrant democratic institutions, was the leading racist jurisdiction in the world in the early twentieth century.
An obvious example is the Jim Crow South, where white legislatures passed laws imposing racial segregation and reversing many of the gains of the post-Civil War Reconstruction period.
But that is hardly the only example.
Those on the far right in Europe also admired America’s early-twentieth-century immigration policies, which were designed to exclude “undesirable” races.
In his manifesto Mein Kampf, Hitler singled out America as “the one state” that was progressing toward the creation of a healthy race-based order.
Indeed, during this period, 30 US states had anti-miscegenation laws intended to safeguard racial purity.
America’s democratic institutions did not stand in the way of such policies in the early twentieth century.
On the contrary, anti-miscegenation laws were the product of America’s democratic system, which gave full voice to many Americans’ racism.
And US courts upheld these legal innovations, using flexible common-law precedents to decide who would acquire the privileged status of “white.”
The Nazis paid close attention.
As they concocted their own racial statutes – the Nuremberg Laws of 1935 – they pored over American race law as a model.
So today, instead of asking whether American institutions will survive the Trump presidency, we must ask how American institutions can be put in the service of wrongful ends.
After all, while America’s early-twentieth-century race laws are gone, it still has the same overheated democratic order and common-law flexibility that it had back then.
These institutions might no longer produce Jim Crow laws; but the American criminal-justice system, for example, remains a poster child for institutionalized racism.
Americans should be ashamed that their country’s institutions laid the groundwork for Nazi race law.
But they should not be worrying about the threat of renascent Nazism, despite Trump’s clear ambivalence in condemning white supremacists.
Rather, Americans should worry about the potential of their institutions to facilitate evils that are, as loath as we are to admit it, as American as apple pie.
Sex, Lies, and Leadership
LONDON – News events can often serve as important catalysts for introspection, not least for members of company boards.
Recent revelations of the Russian government’s involvement in hacking into the Democratic National Committee’s computer system – just two years after North Korea’s hack of Sony Pictures – has spurred a push in boardrooms around the world to tighten their organizations’ cyber security.
Likewise, stories of illegal or unethical labor practices – for example, among Apple suppliers in China – have inspired companies to take a close look at their supply chains.
And criticism of excessive executive remuneration has led to frantic meetings by many boards’ compensation committees.
But there is one issue in the news that has not yet received sufficient attention in boardrooms: child sexual abuse.
In the United Kingdom, the last month has brought harrowing reports about child abuse in youth soccer teams, where promising young athletes attempt to play their way to the professional level.
At last count, 98 amateur and professional clubs in the UK were implicated in some way.
While the public has been shocked by the revelations, the affected clubs’ leaders may not have been – at least not in every case.
After all, many clubs had previously heard allegations of sexual abuse of young players, but had chosen to ignore them or cover them up, at times even doling out hush money to the victims – all for the sake of protecting their own reputations.
Crewe Alexandra’s board, for example, actively discussed sexual abuse allegations against a coach, Barry Bennell, in the late 1980s, but decided not to report him to the police or even to fire him. Bennell turned out to be a serial pedophile.
Though he was ultimately tried and sentenced in 1998, he first got to spend several more years abusing young boys, thanks in no small part to Crewe’s spineless and venal board.
Even today, boards are sometimes choosing to defend their reputations at the expense of basic human decency.
Last July, Chelsea Football Club paid a former footballer £50,000 ($62,000) to agree not to speak of the abuse he allegedly endured in the 1970s.
The five-year review of child safety measures, launched by the Football Association (the governing body of UK soccer) in 2001, was dropped after just two years, reportedly in response to resistance from some FA staff.
Yet the scandal plaguing UK soccer is hardly unique.
According to a just-released joint investigation by the IndyStar and USA Today, at least 368 gymnasts in the United States have alleged some form of sexual abuse over the last 20 years.
Top officials at USA Gymnastics, one of the country’s most prominent Olympic organizations, not only failed to alert police to those allegations; they hid the complaints.
Even coaches who were fired, the report asserts, were often not flagged, meaning that predatory coaches could simply start training children at a new gym.
And then there is the Penn State scandal, in which the university’s trustees turned a blind eye to a long-running cover-up of the serial pedophilia of Jerry Sandusky, a former assistant football coach who gained access to his victims through his own charity for troubled youth.
Two former university officials have been charged in the alleged cover-up.
Now that the truth has come out, there is nowhere to hide.
The FA and clubs across the UK are scrambling to conduct investigations and reviews.
USA Gymnastics has hired a former prosecutor to help it strengthen its child-protection policies, and its board of directors has established a policy review panel.
Penn State fired the coach under whom Sandusky worked, Joe Paterno, for failing to pursue an allegation against Sandusky that a subordinate brought to his attention in 2002.
But it should not be only the affected organizations that take action.
Even “innocent” companies and organizations must evaluate and upgrade their policies for protecting vulnerable people, along with their means for enforcing those policies.
They must also review their records, to identify lapses and ensure that past mistakes are not repeated.
Such reviews are needed not just in obviously child-related sectors, like education or sports, but wherever power differentials are a permanent feature of operations.
Any organization operating in countries or communities where it has a great deal of influence and leverage must take action to ensure that no staff are using their positions to take advantage of vulnerable people or groups.
Examples include the oil and gas sector, the health sector, and the humanitarian sector, including aid agencies and United Nations peacekeepers.
The responsibility extends beyond the organizations themselves.
As we have seen with the FIFA corruption scandal, sponsors and investors can use their influence to bring about change.
Beyond the moral imperative, doing so is in these actors’ self-interest.
Hiding from a scandal may help you in the short term, but it is harder than ever to keep a secret nowadays – and those who cover it up enable crimes and ethical violations are complicit in them.
In the same vein, companies should be holding other organizations in their supply chains accountable.
As with unfair or illegal labor practices, businesses must refuse to sponsor, supply, or work with organizations that fail to protect their workers from sexual abuse.
Otherwise, they, too, are guilty.
Child sexual abuse is not a new problem.
What has become apparent lately is the power that boards of companies – as well as large investors, like pension and sovereign-wealth funds – have to help stop it.
At a time of collapsing confidence in “elites” – from political leaders to, yes, board members – actively using this power to protect young people would have the added benefit of fostering trust within divided societies.
There is no excuse to delay.
China’s New Emperor
HONG KONG – An anecdote about US President Richard Nixon’s visit to China in 1972 has long been regarded as confirmation of the long view of history taken by Chinese leaders.
Zhou Enlai, Mao’s dutiful number two, is said to have responded to a question about the lessons of the French Revolution by saying that it was too soon to tell.
In fact, according to diplomats who were there, Zhou was discussing not the revolution of 1789, but the 1968 student uprising in Paris, so it probably really was too soon to tell.
After this false start, lessons from the French Revolution have made a comeback in China.
Shortly after the 18th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party in 2012, it was reported that Alexis de Tocqueville’s The Old Regime and the Revolution, written in 1856, had become a “must-read” for senior CCP cadres.
The book’s merits were most enthusiastically touted by Wang Qishan, the man at the helm of President Xi Jinping’s anti-corruption campaign and perhaps Xi’s closest ally.
Toqueville argued that growing prosperity in eighteenth-century France had actually made it more difficult to govern the country.
As people became wealthier, they also became more aware of social and economic inequalities and thus increasingly resentful of the rich and powerful.
Attempts to reform the system only highlighted its vulnerabilities.
Revolution followed, sweeping away the monarchy and aristocracy. Their heads literally rolled.
The CCP’s just-completed 19th National Congress showed the extent to which China’s leaders have taken Toqueville’s insights to heart.
Xi asserted his undisputed authority over his party and country.
Xi consolidated his position during his first term, by reversing much of Deng Xiaoping’s legacy, including the opening of China’s economy, the separation of the CCP from government, and a low-key approach to foreign and security policy.
Xi has also swept aside potential rivals, relying primarily on his far-reaching anti-corruption campaign to target officials previously thought to be untouchable.
He has just overseen the largest-ever purge of the CCP Central Committee.
He has cracked down on even the most restrained criticism or signs of dissent, and has even banned Internet jokes, including memes comparing him to Winnie the Pooh.
In another country, such measures might trigger harsh reproach, with critics accusing Xi of turning his country into an old-school Leninist dictatorship.
In China, however, they have drawn praise from observers who believe that Xi is leading the way to the fulfillment of the “Chinese dream” to rejuvenate the country.
But, for some, the dream is on the verge of becoming a nightmare.
Demographic trends are threatening to turn the labor surplus that helped drive China’s rapid growth over the last few decades into a labor shortage at an unprecedented pace.
Water contamination and scarcity, alongside carbon dioxide emissions and lethal levels of air pollution, are imperiling people’s health and jeopardizing the sustainability of China’s economic performance.
Moreover, Chinese GDP growth, while welcome, is being fueled largely by a combination of fast-rising debt and widespread property bubbles.
Even Chinese researchers admit that their country has one of the highest levels of income inequality in the world.
As the poor get poorer and the rich get richer, many are asking if this is what “socialism with Chinese characteristics” really means.
Of course, there is always an optimist around to offer a positive spin.
China owes most of its debt to itself, because political priorities guide lending as much as commercial considerations do.
China supports international efforts to address environmental degradation and climate change.
Most people are becoming better off, if unevenly.
And Xi’s administration is at least doing something to stamp out the endemic corruption in the CCP.
We should all hope that at least some of what China’s cheerleaders say is true; if Chinese growth collapses, the entire global economy will suffer.
But, even if the optimists are partly vindicated, Xi’s claim that China has found a better way to run a modern society and economy seems far wide of the mark.
To be sure, from the stupefying antics of US President Donald Trump to the damaging rise of populist nationalism in Europe, democratic countries are experiencing their share of trials.
But democratic systems have built-in stabilizing mechanisms that enable them to right themselves without resorting to violence or repression.
That is not the case in Xi’s China.
For years, there was a serious debate in China about the state’s proper role in economic affairs.
One camp maintained that if the CCP relaxed its grip on the economy, it would inevitably lose control of the state.
Others argued just the opposite: unless the Party ceded more economic control, it would lose political power, as the economy’s contradictions multiplied and development became less sustainable.
Xi clearly falls into the statist camp.
But it is not just the Party that Xi is empowering; he is also empowering himself.
In fact, it is hard to know who is ascending the CCP’s commanding heights and who will be struck down for disagreeing with the paramount leader.
This hasn’t deterred outsiders from speculating, but there is not much point in playing that guessing game.
Xi, like any other emperor, will continue to appoint courtiers who follow him wherever he leads.
But with great power comes great responsibility – and, at this point, Xi’s power is virtually absolute.
That is a heavy burden for one man.
Xi may be much smarter than Trump (not a high hurdle to clear), but that is not enough to guarantee a stable and prosperous future for China.
And, if things go wrong, everyone will know whom to blame.
There is a reason why dictatorial dynasties tend to end up the same way.
You don’t have to read Toqueville to know that.
Empowering China’s New Miracle Workers
MILAN – As the Chinese Communist Party’s 19th National Congress has unfolded, much of the focus has been on who will occupy the key positions in President Xi Jinping’s administration for the next five years.
But China’s future trajectory depends crucially on another group of leaders, who have received far less attention: the technocrats who will carry out the specific tasks associated with China’s economic reform and transformation.
Over the last four decades, China’s technocrats have collectively engineered a miraculous transformation.
The current generation, a gifted group of policymakers, will step down in or around March 2018, passing the baton to a new generation.
That generation – highly educated, experienced, and, for the most part, successful on their own merits – is prepared to carry China’s economic and social progress forward with great skill and dedication.
The question is whether they will have an open field on which to run.
One thing is certain: the next generation of technocrats will face very different conditions from those confronted by their predecessors.
China has reached a moment of significant uncertainty.
Beyond the questions inherent in the process of generational turnover, there has been a dramatic shift in China’s dominant policy framework under Xi.
Under Deng Xiaoping – the leader who initiated China’s radical “reform and opening up” in 1978 – the singular policy goal was domestic economic transformation and growth, to be achieved with a collaborative decision-making model that included vigorous internal debate.
Deng explicitly ruled out a broader international agenda for China – a dictate that China’s policymakers followed for more than three decades.
Since taking power in 2012, Xi has changed this policy framework in several key ways.
For starters, he tackled the endemic corruption that had been undermining the credibility of the CCP (and, by extension, China’s governance model), by launching an unprecedented anti-graft campaign that reached the highest levels of the Party’s leadership.
Many expected Xi’s anti-corruption campaign to be a temporary initiative, intended to pave the way for implementation of the aggressive economic reforms announced at the Third Plenary Session of the 18th Central Committee in 2013.
Instead, the campaign has become essentially a permanent feature of Xi’s administration.
Xi believes that a government’s legitimacy is mainly a function of consistently delivered values, together with economic and social progress, with strict commitment to the public interest taking precedence over the form of governance.
While few Western observers have fully recognized this perspective, developments in the West over the last ten years – the 2008 financial crisis, widening income and wealth inequality, and intensifying political polarization – have reinforced this mindset.
As a result, Chinese leaders and citizens are more convinced than ever that government by a strong single party is an essential pillar of stability and growth.
The focus in the West on the form of governance, as opposed to inclusive economic and social outcomes, is misguided, they believe, because both democratic and autocratic systems can be corrupted.
Moreover, China’s economic agenda under Xi has expanded beyond its narrow focus on domestic growth and development to include a concerted effort to expand Chinese influence in the global economy, especially in the developing world.
This broad and expanding external agenda generates claims on resources – you can’t be the dominant external investor in Africa and Central Asia without spending a lot of money – while influencing policy choices.
For example, state-owned enterprises, including banks, may respond more flexibly than purely private enterprises to a variable mix of public and private incentives and investment returns.
Finally, in recent years, China’s policy frameworks have increasingly reflected the inherent tension between the long-standing imperative of ensuring social and political stability and the more modern objective of market liberalization.
China’s leadership remains steadfastly committed to protecting the Party’s interests, which it views as coterminous with those of society.
For that reason, the CCP continues to focus on upholding order and instilling values in all aspects of Chinese life, maintaining an active presence not only in policy debates, but also in private-sector activities and social affairs.
At the same time, the government is seeking to give markets a more decisive role in the economy, unleash the power of entrepreneurship and innovation, and respond more effectively to the needs and desires of a young, educated, and fast-growing middle class.
And for good reason: these are the internal engines that have enabled China to achieve 6-7% annual GDP growth amid a difficult structural shift and middle-income transition, carried out in a relatively weak global economy.
It is hard to say for sure whether these two objectives are in direct conflict with each other.
But there is reason for concern. The kind of dynamic competition that leads to innovation is, after all, far from a centrally guided process, though public-sector choices in areas like basic research do have a substantial impact.
Moreover, in both policymaking and academia, active debate is indispensable to sorting good ideas from bad ones.
Yet while the Chinese system has proved its capacity for high-level internal policy debate among highly trained and experienced participants whose loyalty is not in question, and then act quickly and decisively, China’s leaders remain suspicious of unfettered public debate and commentary.
But many complex policy choices – for example, about financial-sector reform and opening up – would benefit from the winnowing process that greater openness affords.
Over the next five years, China’s success will depend largely on how well the government’s complex agenda, and the tensions it entails, are managed.
To achieve their objectives, China’s leaders will need to strike a delicate balance between a muscular, disciplined, and ubiquitous Party, setting standards and protecting the public interest, and innovative, empowered, and potent markets, driving the economy into the future.
The Economic Case for China’s Belt and Road
NEW YORK – Since 2013, China has been pursuing its “Belt and Road” initiative, which aims to develop physical infrastructure and policy linkages connecting more than 60 countries across Asia, Europe, and Africa.
Critics worry that China may be so focused on expanding its geopolitical influence, in order to compete with the likes of the United States and Japan, that it may pursue projects that make little economic sense.
But, if a few conditions are met, the economic case for the initiative is strong.
As a recent Asian Development Bank report confirms, many Belt and Road countries are in urgent need of large-scale infrastructure investment – precisely the type of investment that China has pledged.
Some, such as Bangladesh and Kyrgyzstan, lack reliable electricity supplies, which is impeding the development of their manufacturing sectors and stifling their ability to export.
Others, like Indonesia, do not have enough ports for internal economic integration or international trade.
The Belt and Road initiative promises to help countries overcome these constraints, by providing external funding for ports, roads, schools, hospitals, and power plants and grids.
In this sense, the initiative could function much like America’s post-1945 Marshall Plan, which is universally lauded for its contribution to the reconstruction and economic recovery of war-ravaged Europe.
Of course, external funding alone is not sufficient for success.
Recipient countries must also undertake key reforms that increase policy transparency and predictability, thereby reducing investment risk.
Indeed, implementation of complementary reforms will be a key determinant of the economic returns on Belt and Road investments.
For China, the Belt and Road investments are economically appealing, particularly when private Chinese firms take the lead in carrying them out.
In 2013, when China first proposed the Belt and Road initiative, the country was sitting on $4 trillion in foreign-exchange reserves, which were earning a very low dollar return (less than 1% a year).
In terms of China’s own currency, the returns were negative, given the expected appreciation of the renminbi against the US dollar at the time.
In this sense, Belt and Road investments are not particularly costly for China, particularly when their far-reaching potential benefits are taken into account.
China’s trade-to-GDP ratio exceeds 40% – substantially higher than that of the US – owing partly to underdeveloped infrastructure and inadequate economic diversification among China’s trading partners.
By addressing these weaknesses, China’s Belt and Road investments can lead to a substantial increase in participant countries’ and China’s own trade volumes, benefiting firms and workers substantially.
This is not to suggest that such investments are risk-free for China.
The economic returns will depend on the quality of firms’ business decisions.
In particular, because efficiency is not the primary consideration, Chinese state-owned enterprises (SOEs) might purse low-return projects. That is why China’s SOE-reform process must be watched carefully.
Nonetheless, while the Belt and Road initiative is clearly driven partly by strategic objectives, a cost-benefit analysis shows that the economic case is also very strong – so strong, in fact, that one might ask why China didn’t undertake it sooner.
Even the United States and other countries may reap significant economic returns.
A decade after the global financial crisis erupted, recovery remains weak and tentative in much of the world. Bold, large-scale infrastructure investments can provide much-needed short-run stimulus to global aggregate demand.
The US, for one, is likely to see a surge in demand for its own exports, including cars, locomotives, planes, and high-end construction equipment, and financial, accounting, educational, and legal services.
In the longer term, the new infrastructure will ease logistical bottlenecks, reducing the costs of production inputs. The result will be higher productivity and faster global growth.
If Belt and Road projects are held to high environmental and social standards, significant progress can also be made on global challenges such as climate change and inequality.
The more countries choose to participate in these projects, the better the chance of achieving these standards, and the greater the global social returns will be.
In an era when some of the world’s most influential countries are turning inward, talking about erecting trade barriers and constructing border walls, the world needs initiatives focused on building bridges and roads, both literal and figurative – initiatives like the Belt and Road strategy.
Why China’s Capital-Account Liberalization Has Stalled
BEIJING – In early 2012, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) took advantage of what it viewed as a “strategic opportunity” to accelerate capital-account liberalization, which has been underway since 2009.
The renminbi, it was expected, would be “basically” convertible by the end of 2015, and fully convertible by the end of 2020.
But things haven’t worked out as expected.
Problems began in 2014, when China’s capital account, which had been in surplus since the 1990s, swung into deficit.
By the end of the next year, the deficit had grown so large that China’s overall balance of payments (BOP), too, turned negative, even as China’s current-account surplus remained above $300 billion.
Last year, China’s capital-account deficit amounted to some $200 billion.
To protect the renminbi, the PBOC intervened heavily – a process that proved costly.
In less than two years, China’s foreign-exchange reserves fell from their peak of $4 trillion in mid-2014 to just below $3 trillion.
At first, many were indifferent to the losses.
Some even argued that there were no losses at all, but rather a positive shift in resource allocation, with official reserves becoming privately held foreign assets.
After all, they pointed out, as China’s foreign-exchange reserves fell by $1 trillion from the second quarter of 2014 to the end of 2016, holdings of foreign assets by the private sector increased by $900 billion.
But this argument failed to recognize that, during the same period, China’s cumulative current-account surplus was $750 billion.
By definition, a country’s current-account surplus should be equal to the increase in the country’s net foreign assets.
So what really happened was that $850 billion of China’s foreign-exchange reserves had gone missing.
And, in fact, this process had begun much earlier.
From the first quarter of 2011 to the third quarter of 2016, while China’s cumulative current-account surplus was $1.28 trillion, its net foreign assets fell by $12.4 billion.
In other words, since 2011, some $1.3 trillion of China’s foreign assets has disappeared.
Recognizing this dangerous trend, the PBOC abruptly hit the brakes on capital-account liberalization last year, tightening capital controls to a degree not seen since the Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s.
The gap between changes in a country’s current account and its net-foreign-asset position partly reflects “net errors and omissions” in the BOP calculations.
When capital flows out of a country, the transactions are supposed to be reflected in the BOP table.
But in a country like China, where capital flight is illegal and investors attempt to evade capital controls, transactions might not be recorded at all.
Instead, they show up in net errors and omissions, which in China have turned strongly negative in recent years, owing, in my view, to accelerating capital flight.
Some in China have argued that the negative trend for net errors and omissions is simply the result of statistical mistakes.
But when the shortfall amounts to $1.3 trillion, such claims can hardly be taken seriously.
Nor can they account for the fact that, over the last six years, China’s net errors and omissions have moved in just one direction, always contributing to the BOP deficit.
Although China’s net errors and omissions must be linked to capital flight, the figures do not have to line up exactly; net errors and omissions can be either larger or smaller than the actual figure.
In China’s case, the latter seems to be true, for a simple reason: capital flight may also be recorded as regular capital outflows that do not affect errors and omissions.
For example, as they pursue overseas mergers and acquisitions, some Chinese corporations have taken large amounts of capital out of China legally.
But no one knows whether those outflows will translate into net foreign assets owned by Chinese residents.
That is why, to gauge the scale of capital flight, one must also consider the difference between year-end investment positions, net of “financial transactions” and “other changes in position.”
Doing so leads to a stark conclusion.
Since 2012, and especially since 2014, China has experienced massive capital flight.
If the government had not taken action to slow, if not halt, the process of capital-account liberalization in 2016, the results could have been truly devastating.
In the past, the key challenge facing China was to stop importing “dark matter”: as one of the world’s largest net creditors, China needed to stop running an investment-income deficit.
Today’s challenge is to avoid “matter annihilation”: China must prevent its net foreign assets from disappearing.
In early 2013, when capital-account liberalization was in full swing, I wrote that, “with China’s financial system too fragile to withstand external shocks, and the global economy mired in turmoil, the PBOC would be unwise to gamble on the ability of rapid capital-account liberalization to generate a healthier and more robust financial system.”
In fact, I continued, “Given China’s extensive reform agenda, further opening of the capital account can wait; and, in view of liberalization’s ambiguous benefits and significant risks, it should.”
Four years later, this advice is worth reiterating.
The Limits of Chinese Soft Power
CAMBRIDGE – China has been making major efforts to increase its ability to influence other countries without force or coercion.
In 2007, then-President Hu Jintao told the Communist Party that the country needed to increase its soft power; President Xi Jinping repeated the same message last year.
They know that, for a country like China, whose growing economic and military power risks scaring its neighbors into forming counter-balancing coalitions, a smart strategy must include efforts to appear less frightening.
But their soft-power ambitions still face major obstacles.
To be sure, China’s efforts have had some impact.
As China enrolls countries as members of its Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and doles out billions of dollars of aid during state visits abroad, some observers worry that, when it comes to soft power, China could actually be taking the lead over countries like the United States.
The American sinologist David Shambaugh, for example, estimates that the country spends roughly $10 billion a year in “external propaganda.”
By comparison, the US spent only $666 million on public diplomacy last year.
Yet the billions of dollars China is spending on its charm offensive have had only a limited return.
Polls in North America, Europe, India, and Japan show that opinions about China’s influence are predominantly negative.
The country is viewed more positively in Latin America and Africa, where it has no territorial disputes and human-rights concerns are not always high on the public agenda.
But even in many countries in those regions, Chinese practices like importing labor for infrastructure projects are unpopular.
Combining hard and soft power into a smart strategy, it turns out, is not easy.
A country derives its soft power primarily from three resources: its culture (in places that find it appealing), its political values (when it lives up to them at home and abroad), and its foreign policies (when they are seen as legitimate and having moral authority).
China has emphasized its cultural and economic strengths, but it has paid less attention to the political aspects that can undermine its efforts.
Two major factors limit China’s soft power, as measured by recent international polls.
The first is nationalism.
The Communist Party has based its legitimacy not only on a high rate of economic growth, but also on appeals to nationalism.
Doing so has reduced the universal appeal of Xi’s “Chinese Dream,” while encouraging policies in the South China Sea and elsewhere that antagonize its neighbors.
With, for example, China bullying the Philippines over possession of disputed islands in the South China Sea, the Confucius Institute that China established in Manila to teach Chinese culture can win only so much goodwill.
(China has opened some 500 such institutes in more than 100 countries.)
The consequences of the country’s foreign policy can be seen in last year’s anti-Chinese riots in Vietnam following the positioning of a Chinese oil drilling rig in waters claimed by both countries.
The other limit is China's reluctance to take full advantage of an uncensored civil society.
As noted by The Economist, the Chinese Communist Party has not bought into the idea that soft power springs largely from individuals, the private sector, and civil society.
Instead, it has clung to the view that the government is the main source of soft power, promoting ancient cultural icons that it thinks might have global appeal, often using the tools of propaganda.
In today’s media landscape, information is abundant.
What is scarce is attention, which depends on credibility – and government propaganda is rarely credible.
For all of China’s efforts to position the Xinhua news agency and China Central Television as competitors of CNN and the BBC, the international audience for brittle propaganda is vanishingly small.
The US, by contrast, derives much of its soft power not from the government, but from civil society – everything from universities and foundations to Hollywood and pop culture.
China does not yet have global cultural industries on the scale of Hollywood or universities capable of rivaling America’s.
Even more important, it lacks the many non-governmental organizations that generate much of America’s soft power.
In addition to generating good will and promoting the country’s image abroad, non-governmental sources of soft power can sometimes compensate for the government’s unpopular policies – like the US invasion of Iraq – through their critical and uncensored reaction.
China, by contrast, has watched its government policies undermine its soft-power successes.
Indeed, the domestic crackdown on human-rights activists undercut the soft-power gains of the 2008 Beijing Olympics.
And the benefits of the 2009 Shanghai Expo were rapidly undermined by the jailing of Nobel Peace Prize laureate Liu Xiaobo and the television screens around the world broadcasting scenes of an empty chair at the Oslo ceremonies.
Marketing experts call this “stepping on your own message.”
China’s aid programs are often successful and constructive.
Its economy is strong, and its traditional culture is widely admired.
But if the country is to realize its enormous soft-power potential, it will have to rethink its policies at home and abroad, limiting its claims upon its neighbors and learning to accept criticism in order to unleash the full talents of its civil society.
As long as China fans the flames of nationalism and holds tight the reins of party control, its soft power will always remain limited.
The Making of China’s Consumer Society
HONG KONG – China’s transformation from a manufacturing-driven and export-led economy to one underpinned by services and domestic consumption is firmly underway.
And that’s good news not just for China, but also for the future of the global economy.
The 2016-17 edition of the Blue Book of China’s Commercial Sector by Fung Business Intelligence and the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences maps the change.
China’s retail markets reached CN¥30 trillion ($4.6 trillion) in 2015, after more than a decade of double-digit growth.
Household consumption has begun to climb, even as the pace of investment has fallen, and now exceeds 60% of GDP.
Though the consumption growth rate has slowed to 10.7%, the Blue Book projects that China’s domestic market may reach CN¥50 trillion by 2020.
A key driver of this transformation has been Internet technology.
Building on heavy investments in public infrastructure, such as ports, airports, roads, rail, and telecommunications, the Internet is now expanding rapidly the range of choices available to Chinese consumers, while lowering costs and accelerating delivery.
As a result, China’s online retail sales have surged in recent years, from 6.3% of total retail sales in 2012 to 12.9% by 2015.
By 2020, 40% of all retail transactions in China may be conducted online.
Online sales via mobile phones have jumped from only 1.5% in 2011 to 55.5% in 2015, and may reach 73.8% by 2018.
China has now overtaken the United States to build the world’s largest online retail market.
With a growth rate of some 33%, it is also the fastest-growing such market.
And despite growth in Internet use – the number of connected Chinese has risen from 253 million in 2008 to 688 million last year – there is plenty of room for further expansion.
This progress reflects innovations that enable broad-based consumption without the construction and maintenance of expensive brick-and-mortar outlets.
In fact, growth in mobile sales has been driven by lower-income consumers, particularly in rural areas, where more than 81% of Internet use occurs via mobile devices.
One key innovation has been multi-sided platforms like Alibaba, which, by providing access to production, logistics, distribution, and payments, challenge traditional business models – and with considerable success.
In the second quarter of 2016, Alibaba announced that its revenue from China’s retail market had increased by 49% year on year; another online platform, Tencent, reported a 52% increase.
By connecting small and medium-size enterprises (which account for 80% of employment in China) with the consumer base, such platforms erode some of the competitive advantage of large state-owned enterprises (SOEs).
Indeed, while the returns from China’s Internet retailing revolution have been highly concentrated, for once this concentration has not been in the state sector.
In online retailing via mobile devices, Alibaba held an 84.2% share of the market last year, with the next largest online retailer, JD.com, capturing just 5.7%.
In the business-to-consumer market, Alibaba’s Tmall claimed a 58% market share in the third quarter of 2015, with JD.com taking just 22.9%.
In third-party online payment services, Alipay held 47.5% of the market, while Tenpay captured 20%, and UnionPay, the only service developed by the banking community, had 10.9%.
As a result, SOEs, which have long specialized in single markets or products, have now begun to recognize that they need to re-tool to compete both in China and in global markets.
Given that SOE reform has long been on China’s agenda, this extra impetus may prove beneficial.
But the challenge of determining how to create a level playing field for healthy competition and improve capital allocation in the Internet age remains.
It is not just China’s large companies that need to rethink their business models.
As China’s e-commerce platforms become increasingly global, they may erode the dominance of giant multinationals in international trade.
Already in 2015, China’s cross-border e-commerce amounted to an estimated ¥5.2 trillion, or 17.6% of the country’s total trade; it may reach ¥8 trillion, or 23% of total trade, by next year.
All of this growth is great news for China; indeed, at a time of slowing performance in many traditional sectors, online retailing could be an economic lifesaver.
But it also represents a major challenge for a government that has long relied on top-down decision-making.
China’s e-commerce revolution enables the country’s consumers to decide where to put their money.
They can choose not only what kinds of goods and services they deem worthwhile, but also where to live and receive an education.
As a result, they have become a key driver behind the transformation of the housing market, supply chains, finance, and even monetary policy.
The task for China’s leaders is to respond more effectively to their citizens’ needs and desires, including by accelerating progress on economic reform.
Specifically, they must phase out obsolete supply chains saddled with overcapacity, bad debts, and falling employment, while taxing the winners in the e-commerce game.
These imperatives are challenging traditional approaches to monetary, fiscal, industrial, environmental, and social policy, while testing the capacity of the bureaucracy and political system.
China’s transformation into a consumer society will have profound implications for domestic and global suppliers and distributors of goods and services.
At first, it might hurt some of China’s trading partners, particularly the emerging economies that have long depended on Chinese demand for their commodity exports.
The decline in Chinese imports has already contributed to a decline in commodity prices.
Moreover, foreign importers may find that Chinese-manufactured consumer goods now cater more to local tastes and preferences.
Whatever challenges emerge, the fact is that a prosperous China, underpinned by local consumers, will contribute to – and shape – a prosperous global economy.
We can thank e-commerce for that.
The Next Battle in China’s War on Corruption
HONG KONG – Corruption is a cancer to which no society is immune.
It raised the death toll of Iran’s recent earthquake, owing to substandard housing construction ten years ago.
It has afflicted the United States Navy, which is now investigating more than 60 admirals and hundreds more officers for fraud and bribery.
It has brought down countless governments, from Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff’s administration last year to Chiang Kai-shek’s Nationalist government of the Republic of China.
Chinese President Xi Jinping, a keen student of history, is well aware of corruption’s destructive potential – and has confronted the phenomenon head-on.
But, as China’s economy continues to modernize, much work remains to be done.
Prior to the economic reforms of the 1980s, corruption in China was relatively petty, as the market’s limited size constrained opportunities for administrative abuse.
But, as the market deepened, inadequate legislation and weak institutional safeguards facilitated increasingly brazen corruption and administrative abuses.
Meanwhile, as income and education levels rose, citizens became less tolerant of such abuses, increasingly demanding transparent and lawful delivery of basic public goods, from infrastructure to environmental protection, as well as a fair distribution of income and opportunities.
Recognizing the potential of corruption to undermine the legitimacy of the Communist Party of China and the authority of the Chinese state, Xi has embarked on an anti-graft campaign that is unprecedented in scale, scope, and depth.
Over the last five years, that campaign has resulted in the dismissal, sanction, or other punishment of no less than 440 provincial officials, 8,900 at the municipal level, 63,000 at the county level, and 278,000 at the village level.
Some 58,000 individuals have been referred for further criminal investigation.
All in all, 1.7% of the CPC’s 89 million members – including both “tigers” (Party leaders) and “flies” (petty officials) – have been affected.
But the initiative is far from over.
At the CPC’s 19th National Congress last month, the Party endorsed the creation of a National Supervision Commission to consolidate and modernize the anti-graft agency, so that it will expand beyond Party members to cover all officials exercising public power at all levels.
But building robust and lasting anti-graft institutions will not be easy, owing to the enduring ability of corrupt officials to capture such institutions.
Consider the kind of corruption in advanced economies exposed by the 2007-2008 global financial crisis, in which vested interests secure the enactment of laws and regulations that entrench their own advantages.
In the US, the Supreme Court’s infamous Citizens United decision of 2010 actively encourages such outcomes, by allowing corporations and unions to spend unlimited sums anonymously to help secure the election or defeat of individual candidates.
As a result of the decision, outside spending in the 2016 election cycle reached nearly $1.4 billion in 2016, compared less than $100 million in the 2006 cycle.
So corruption is not just a failure of the state; it is also closely linked to the failure of market, legal, and ideological systems.
If the concentrated economic and social power that financial markets and network economies tend to create can be used to capture and control political power, an effective system of checks and balances becomes virtually impossible.
The London School of Economics anthropologist David Graeber frames the problem in terms of how political actors approach bureaucracy.
As Graeber points out, those on the political right condemn excessive bureaucracy.
Yet their solution – to reduce the role of the state and allow market forces to take over – is actually what fuels cumbersome bureaucratic expansion.
Graeber sums up this argument in what he calls an “iron law of liberalism”: “any market reform, any government initiative intended to reduce red tape and promote market forces, will have the ultimate effect of increasing the total number of regulations, the total amount of paperwork, and the total number of bureaucrats the government employs.”
In other words, markets can work efficiently only with the guidance of a competent, honest, and fair state, with effective protections against abuses and graft from both the market actors who offer bribes and the officials who accept them.
What does this mean for China?
For starters, the country needs to develop modern mechanisms for resolving civil disputes arising from unclear property rights or rules for market transactions.
Here, China can take inspiration from the Western common law system, in which cases are decided on the basis of existing precedents, or from the use of administrative courts to resolve disputes between individuals and the bureaucracy.
Hong Kong’ Independent Commission Against Corruption also provides a useful model.
At the same time, China must reduce the incentive for graft, by raising the pay of public servants at all levels.
As it stands, officials’ salaries are usually set with reference to the overall level of national income. But the resulting pay is not high enough to mitigate the temptation officials face to use their enormous power to profit in key sectors, such as energy, finance, and real estate.
Similarly, in advanced economies, officials not only receive much higher pay; they are also often subject to limitations on what they can do, and when, after they leave office.
In China, by contrast, officials can exchange favors while in office for higher-paying jobs or benefits after retirement.
Maintaining accountability and preventing vested interests from capturing institutions – a process that involves entrenching morality within vulnerable bureaucracies – will be no easy feat.
It may well be the toughest challenge Xi faces in realizing what he calls the “China Dream.”
But, for now, China’s anti-corruption agenda seems to be on the right track.
The Great Escape from China
CAMBRIDGE – Since 2016 began, the prospect of a major devaluation of China’s renminbi has been hanging over global markets like the Sword of Damocles.
No other source of policy uncertainty has been as destabilizing.
Few observers doubt that China will have to let the renminbi exchange rate float freely sometime over the next decade. The question is how much drama will take place in the interim, as political and economic imperatives collide.
It might seem odd that a country running a $600 billion trade surplus in 2015 should be worried about currency weakness.
But a combination of factors, including slowing economic growth and a gradual relaxation of restrictions on investing abroad, has unleashed a torrent of capital outflows.
Private citizens are now allowed to take up to $50,000 per year out of the country.
If just one of every 20 Chinese citizens exercised this option, China’s foreign-exchange reserves would be wiped out.
At the same time, China’s cash-rich companies have been employing all sorts of devices to get money out.
A perfectly legal approach is to lend in renminbi and be repaid in foreign currency.
A not-so-legal approach is to issue false or inflated trade invoices – essentially a form of money laundering.
For example, a Chinese exporter might report a lower sale price to an American importer than it actually receives, with the difference secretly deposited in dollars into a US bank account (which might in turn be used to purchase a Picasso).
Now that Chinese firms have bought up so many US and European companies, money laundering can even be done in-house.
The Chinese hardly invented this idea.
After World War II, when a ruined Europe was smothered in foreign-exchange controls, illegal capital flows out of the continent often averaged 10% of the value of trade or more.
As one of the world’s largest trading countries, it is virtually impossible for China to keep a tight lid on capital outflows when the incentives to leave become large enough.
Indeed, despite the giant trade surplus, the People’s Bank of China has been forced to intervene heavily to prop up the exchange rate – so much so that foreign-currency reserves actually fell by $500 billion in 2015.
With such leaky capital controls, China’s war chest of $3 trillion won’t be enough to hold down the fort indefinitely.
In fact, the more people worry that the exchange rate is going down, the more they want to get their money out of the country immediately.
That fear, in turn, has been an important factor driving down the Chinese stock market.
There is a lot of market speculation that the Chinese will undertake a sizable one-time devaluation, say 10%, to weaken the renminbi enough to ease downward pressure on the exchange rate.
But, aside from providing fodder for the likes of Donald Trump, who believes that China is an unfair trader, this would be a very dangerous choice of strategy for a government that financial markets do not really trust.
The main risk is that a big devaluation would be interpreted as indicating that China’s economic slowdown is far more severe than people think, in which case money would continue to flee.
There is no easy way to improve communication with markets until China learns how to produce credible economic data.
It was a huge news story when China’s 2015 GDP growth was reported at 6.9%, just short of the official target of 7%.
This difference ought to be irrelevant, but markets have treated it with the utmost importance, because investors believe that things must be really bad if the government can’t rig the numbers enough to hit its target.
A good place for the authorities to start would be to establish a commission of economists to produce a more realistic and believable set of historical GNP figures, paving the way for more believable GNP figures going forward.
Instead, the government’s immediate idea for relieving exchange-rate pressure is to peg the renminbi to a basket of 13 currencies, instead of just to the US dollar.
This is a good idea in theory; in practice, however, basket pegs tend to have chronic transparency problems.
Moreover, a basket peg shares most of the problems of a simple dollar peg.
True, the euro and yen have fallen against the dollar over the past couple of years.
If the dollar retreats in 2016, however, the basket peg implies a stronger renminbi-dollar rate, which might be unhelpful.
The government has also indicated that it intends to clamp down more heavily on illegal capital flows; but it will not be easy to put that genie back in the bottle.
Life would be a lot easier today if China had moved to a much greater degree of exchange-rate flexibility back when the going was good, as some of us had advised for more than a decade.
Maybe the authorities will be able to hold on in 2016; but it is more likely that the renminbi will continue its rocky ride – taking global markets along with it.
China, the Digital Giant
SHANGHAI – China has firmly established itself as a global leader in consumer-oriented digital technologies.
It is the world’s largest e-commerce market, accounting for more than 40% of global transactions, and ranks among the top three countries for venture capital investment in autonomous vehicles, 3D printing, robotics, drones, and artificial intelligence (AI).
One in three of the world’s unicorns (start-ups valued at more than $1 billion) is Chinese, and the country’s cloud providers hold the world record for computing efficiency.
While China runs a trade deficit in services overall, it has lately been running a trade surplus in digital services of up to $15 billion per year.
Powering China’s impressive progress in the digital economy are Internet giants like Alibaba, Baidu, and Tencent, which are commercializing their services on a massive scale, and bringing new business models to the world.
Together, these three companies have 500-900 million active monthly users in their respective sectors.
Their rise has been facilitated by light – or, perhaps more accurate, late – regulation.
For example, regulators put a cap on the value of online money transfers a full 11 years after Alipay introduced the service.
Now, these Internet firms are using their positions to invest in China’s digital ecosystem – and in the emerging cadre of tenacious entrepreneurs that increasingly define it.
Alibaba, Baidu, and Tencent together fund 30% of China’s top start-ups, such as Didi Chuxing ($50 billion), Meituan-Dianping ($30 billion), and JD.com ($56 billion).
With the world’s largest domestic market and plentiful venture capital, China’s old “copy-cat” entrepreneurs have transformed themselves into innovation powerhouses.
They fought like gladiators in the world’s most competitive market, learned to develop sophisticated business models (such as Taobao’s freemium model), and built impregnable moats to protect their businesses (for example, Meituan-Dianping created an end-to-end food app, including delivery).
As a result, the valuation of Chinese innovators is many times higher than that of their Western counterparts.
Moreover, China leads the world in some sectors, from livestreaming (one example is Musical.ly, a lip-syncing and video-sharing app) to bicycle sharing (Mobike and Ofo exceed 50 million rides per day in China, and are now expanding abroad).
Most important, China is at the frontier of mobile payments, with more than 600 million Chinese mobile users able to conduct peer-to-peer transactions with nearly no fees.
China’s mobile-payment infrastructure – which already handles far more transactions than the third-party mobile-payment market in the United States – will become a platform for many more innovations.
As Chinese firms become increasingly technically capable, the country’s market advantage is turning into a data advantage – critical to support the development of AI.
The Chinese firm Face++ recently raised $460 million, the largest amount ever for an AI company.
DJI (a $14 billion consumer drone company), iFlyTek (a $14 billion voice recognition company), and Hikvision (a $50 billion video-surveillance company) are the world’s most valuable firms in their respective domains.
Another important developing trend in China is “online merging with offline” (OMO) – a trend that, along with AI, Sinovation Ventures is betting on.
The physical world becomes digitized, with companies detecting a person’s location, movements, and identity, and then transmitting the data so that it can help shape online experiences.
For example, OMO stores will be equipped with sensors that can identify customers and discern their likely behavior as seamlessly as e-commerce websites do now.
Similarly, OMO language learning will combine native teachers lecturing remotely, local assistants keeping the atmosphere fun, autonomous software correcting pronunciation, and autonomous hardware grading homework and tests.
With China in a position to rebuild its offline infrastructure, it can secure a leading position in OMO.
Yet, even as China leads the way in digitizing consumer industries, business adoption of digital technologies has lagged.
This may be about to change.
New McKinsey Global Institute research finds that three digital forces – disintermediation (cutting out the middle man), disaggregation (separating processes into component parts), and dematerialization (shifting from physical to electronic form) – could account for (or create) 10-45% of the industry revenue pool by 2030.
Those actors that successfully capitalize on this shift are likely to be large enough to influence the global digital landscape, inspiring digital entrepreneurs far beyond China’s borders.
Value will shift from slow-moving incumbents to nimble digital attackers, armed with new business models, and from one part of the value chain to another.
Large-scale creative destruction will root out inefficiencies and vault China to a new echelon of global competitiveness.
China’s government has grand plans for the country’s future as a digital world power.
The State Council-led Mass Entrepreneurship and Innovation Program has resulted in more than 8,000 incubators and accelerators.
The government’s Guiding Fund program has provided a total of $27.4 billion to venture capital and private equity investors – a passive investment, but with special redemption incentives.
The authorities are now mobilizing resources to invest $180 billion in building China’s 5G mobile network over the next seven years, and are supporting the development of quantum technology.
The State Council has also issued guidelines for developing AI technologies, with the goal of making China a global AI innovation center by 2030.
Xiongan, now under construction, may be the first “smart city” designed for autonomous vehicles.
In Guangdong Province, the government has set an ambitious target of 80% automation by 2020.
Such aspirations will inevitably disrupt the labor market, beginning with routine white-collar jobs (such as customer service and telemarketing), followed by routine blue-collar jobs (such as assembly line work), and finally affecting some non-routine jobs (such as driving or even radiology).
Recent MGI research found that in a rapid-automation scenario, some 82-102 million Chinese workers would need to switch jobs.
Retraining the displaced will be a major challenge for China’s government, as will preventing the major digital players from securing innovation-stifling monopolies.
But the government’s readiness to embrace the emerging digital age, pursuing supportive policies and avoiding excessive regulation, has already placed the country at a significant advantage.
China’s Dangerous Digital Agenda
WASHINGTON, DC/BRUSSELS – When the Chinese e-commerce juggernaut Alibaba listed on the New York Stock Exchange late last year, it became the world's 17th largest publicly traded company overnight, with a market capitalization of $230 billion – larger than Amazon, eBay, or Facebook.
Europe, however, seems to have missed the news.
Indeed, instead of responding to China's digital rise, the European Union has remained fixated on the global success of American platforms like Amazon, Facebook, and Google, even threatening punitive actions against them.
A couple of months after Alibaba's IPO, the European Parliament passed a 	non-binding resolution to prevent online companies like Google from “abusing" their market position.
The resolution called for “unbundling search engines from other commercial services."
But there is mounting evidence that the real competitive challenge for Europe will come from the East, especially China, which is taking a protectionist and expansionist approach to securing its future digital dominance.
If the European Union and the United States do not collaborate to limit China on this front, they risk leaving the playing field wide open to a regulatory regime based on principles that directly controvert the fundamental values the West's two largest economies share.
There is no doubting China's success in the Internet economy.
With Alibaba, China has 27 so-called unicorns (companies that are valued at $1 billion following an IPO, sale, or publicly declared round of funding), whereas Europe has only 21.
China also boasts four of the world's top ten most visited websites.
Baidu, the country's leading search engine, anticipates that half of its revenues will come from outside of China within just six years.
To be sure, China still lags far behind the US, with its 79 unicorns, in the digital sphere.
But it poses a greater threat to the sector's openness and competitiveness, as its leaders rely on mercantilism and protectionism to further their high-tech goals.
For example, the Chinese State Council's plan to ensure that the country leads the world in semiconductor production by 2030 will involve the provision of at least €20 billion ($22.6 billion) in government subsidies to Chinese-owned firms, as well as discriminatory procurement to shut out their foreign competitors.
Similarly, the Chinese government has committed €640 billion annually for five years to just seven “strategic emerging industries," including information and communications technology.
Moreover, China employs technology standards as a market barrier, while using its anti-monopoly laws to harass US and European companies.
Add to that the theft of valuable European and American intellectual property, including through the government-backed hacking of European companies' computers, and the threat that China poses to open competition could not be clearer.
But the problem is not confined to China's borders.
The “Beijing consensus" – China's statist policy approach, often contrasted with the “Washington consensus" of market-friendly policies broadly favored by Europe and the US – is inspiring a growing number of countries to shower domestic tech champions with privileges and subsidies.
Perhaps more problematic, Chinese influence is fueling support for Internet balkanization – the splintering of the global Internet into smaller, closed national networks – in a number of countries, including key players like Brazil, Russia, and Turkey, and even has sympathizers in Europe.
Such data localization may sound harmless, especially when it is presented as a legitimate response to revelations of far-reaching surveillance by the likes of the US National Security Agency.
And, in promising a “secure" national cloud, this is precisely what policymakers are attempting to do.
But those are weak grounds for undermining one of today's greatest innovations and most effective economic-growth engines, especially given that hacking can, and does, occur from anywhere.
Indeed, the gravest cyber crimes originate from precisely those countries, including China and Russia, that are leading the balkanization movement.
The surest way to accelerate China's digital rise is a transatlantic falling out over relatively small issues.
Whether it is data or copyright, the Internet of Things, or privacy, the EU and the US must agree on a common path – based on shared values like democracy, the rule of law, and freedom of speech.
Otherwise, China will soon be dictating the terms of trade of the world's fastest-growing economic sector.
If open and pluralistic societies do not stand up for an open Internet and market-based trade, who will?
The Challenges Confronting China’s Digital Economy
HONG KONG – China’s digital economy is a force to be reckoned with.
The country now accounts for 42% of global e-commerce, boasts one-third of the world’s most successful tech startups, and conducts 11 times more mobile payments than the United States per year.
But there are major challenges ahead.
To be sure, China is on track for continued progress, thanks to its rich ecosystem of innovators, a tech-friendly attitude among regulators and government, and its massive consumer market.
China’s 731 million Internet users outnumber those in the European Union and the US combined.
These factors underpin projections of rapid growth in China’s FinTech market.
From 2016 to 2020, Goldman Sachs expects consumption-related third-party payment value to grow from $1.9 trillion to $4.6 trillion, with lending by non-traditional players soaring from $156 billion to $764 billion and new online-oriented asset management increasing from $8.3 trillion to $11.9 trillion.
Moreover, China is accelerating investment in artificial intelligence.
In its report Artificial Intelligence: Implications for China, McKinsey estimates that AI technology in China could add 0.8 to 1.4 percentage points to China’s annual GDP growth, depending on the speed of adoption.
Early this month, Google AI China was launched in Beijing by the company’s Chinese-born chief scientist for cloud computing, Fei-Fei Li.
Yet China still has a long way to go.
As another recent McKinsey study, Digital China: Powering the Economy to Global Competitiveness, points out, the US remains 4.9 times more digitized than China.
And, within China, there are large variations in various sectors’ level of digitization.
China will confront serious risks as it closes these gaps.
As McKinsey notes, digitization promises to shift and create value equivalent to anywhere from 10% to 45% of total industry revenues in four key sectors (consumer and retail, automotive and mobility, health care, and freight and logistics) by 2030.
This implies significant disruptions to value chains and uncertainty about jobs, consumption, and the socio-political context.
If China is to ensure the continued development of its digital economy, while containing the risks associated with disruption, its leaders will need to implement smart regulations.
And that will require careful consideration of the factors that have contributed to – and impeded – its progress so far.
As recently as a decade ago, few expected China’s remarkable digital breakthrough.
In fact, both of the country’s key Internet pioneers, Jack Ma of Alibaba and Pony Ma of Tencent, experienced early failures.
But thanks to the Chinese leadership’s willingness to experiment, allowing access to foreign capital and technology, these pioneers were able to pursue initial public offerings elsewhere – Tencent in Hong Kong and Alibaba in New York.
As they took advantage of emerging digital technology – not to mention China’s high-quality public infrastructure – to leverage and build services, these pioneers spearheaded rapid progress in China’s digital economy.
Alibaba’s e-commerce platform expanded market access and reduced transaction costs, crowding out traditional middleman who undermined productivity.
Tencent’s WeChat reduced the costs of communication, interaction, coordination, and socialization among individuals, stimulating innovation across industries.
Both broke down barriers among manufacturing, distribution, media, and finance, thereby achieving scale, expanding scope, and increasing speed.
These achievements – which produced major productivity, income, and wealth gains – are a testament to private-sector ingenuity.
But they were facilitated by the state, which pursued a policy of flexible non-enforcement of functional rules and regulations that enabled not only the expansion of private markets in China, but also the integration of those markets into the global economy.
Yet market-based innovations are intrinsically unpredictable, and expectations regarding innovations often overshoot.
In the case of China’s digital economy, imperfect and lagging regulations and enforcement exacerbated the effects of imbalances in the business environment, which enabled the emergence of severe vulnerabilities, from financial and debt risk to pollution and inequality.
Under China’s current system, it is up to the government to deal with these problems.
And, over the last five years, it has attempted to do just that, often using old, imperfect, but already-available administrative tools.
Over the last year alone, China’s authorities have steadily tightened regulations governing the crypto-currency Bitcoin, B2C financing platforms, shadow banking, cross-border capital flows, and debt and securities markets.
But such changes do not address the underlying weaknesses that allow risk to proliferate.
For that, China must build more effective institutions to deal with business failures, absorb losses, and manage risks and uncertainty.
In particular, China needs improved bankruptcy procedures, multilevel capital markets, an effective social-security system, reliable public housing, and a progressive tax regime that aims to reduce inequality.
At the same time, to counter market abuses, China should introduce more robust competition laws, anti-corruption mechanisms, and stronger environmental regulations.
The digital economy is naturally pro-market, pro-productivity, and pro-globalization.
Yet, without effective management, it can generate significant economic imbalances that foster political and social instability.
This is all the more true at a time of large-scale disruptions, owing to rapid technological progress, demographic shifts, and climate change.
The only way to harness the digital economy’s potential while avoiding downside risks is to build fair and inclusive social institutions that protect property rights and ensure efficient markets.
In other words, it all comes down to delineating clearly, appropriately, and effectively the roles of the state and the market.
Deciphering China’s Economic Resilience
NEW HAVEN – Once again, the Chinese economy has defied the hand wringing of the nattering nabobs of negativism.
After decelerating for six consecutive years, real GDP growth appears to be inching up in 2017.
The 6.9% annualized increase just reported for the second quarter exceeds the 6.7% rise in 2016 and is well above the consensus of international forecasters who, just a few months ago, expected growth to be closer to 6.5% this year, and to slow further, to 6%, in 2018.
I have long argued that the fixation on headline GDP overlooks deeper issues shaping the China growth debate.
That is because the Chinese economy is in the midst of an extraordinary structural transformation – with a manufacturing-led producer model giving way to an increasingly powerful services-led consumer model.
To the extent that this implies a shift in the mix of GDP away from exceptionally rapid gains in investment and exports, toward relatively slower-growing internal private consumption, a slowdown in overall GDP growth is both inevitable and desirable.
Perceptions of China’s vulnerability need to be considered in this context.
This debate has a long history.
I first caught a whiff of it back in the late 1990s, during the Asian financial crisis.
From Thailand and Indonesia to South Korea and Taiwan, China was widely thought to be next.
An October 1998 cover story in The Economist, vividly illustrated by a Chinese junk getting sucked into a powerful whirlpool, said it all.
Yet nothing could have been further from the truth.
When the dust settled on the virulent pan-regional contagion, the Chinese economy had barely skipped a beat.
Real GDP growth slowed temporarily, to 7.7% in 1998-1999, before reaccelerating to 10.3% in the subsequent decade.
China’s resilience during the Great Financial Crisis was equally telling.
In the midst of the worst global contraction since the 1930s, the Chinese economy still expanded at a 9.4% average annual rate in 2008-2009.
While down from the blistering, unsustainable 12.7% pace recorded during the three years prior to the crisis, this represented only a modest shortfall from the 30-year post-1980 trend of 10%.
Indeed, were it not for China’s resilience in the depths of the recent crisis, world GDP would not have contracted by 0.1% in 2009, but would have plunged by 1.3% – the sharpest decline in global activity of the post-World War II era.
The latest bout of pessimism over the Chinese economy has focused on the twin headwinds of deleveraging and a related tightening of the property market – in essence, a Japanese-like stagnation.
Once more, the Western lens is out of focus.
Like Japan, China is a high-saving economy that owes its mounting debt largely to itself.
Yet, if anything, China has more of a cushion than Japan to avoid sustainability problems.
According to the International Monetary Fund, China’s national savings is likely to hit 45% of GDP in 2017, well above Japan’s 28% saving rate.
Just as Japan, with its gross government debt at 239% of GDP, has been able to sidestep a sovereign debt crisis, China, with its far larger saving cushion and much smaller sovereign debt burden (49% of GDP), is in much better shape to avoid such an implosion.
To be sure, there can be no mistaking China’s mounting corporate debt problem – with nonfinancial debt-to-GDP ratios hitting an estimated 157% of GDP in late 2016 (versus 102% in late 2008).
This makes the imperatives of state-owned enterprise reform, where the bulk of rising indebtedness has been concentrated, all the more essential in the years ahead.
Moreover, there is always good reason to worry about the Chinese property market.
After all, a rising middle class needs affordable housing.
With the urban share of China’s population rising from less than 20% in 1980 to more than 56% in 2016 – and most likely headed to 70% by 2030 – this is no trivial consideration.
But this means that Chinese property markets – unlike those of other fully urbanized major economies – enjoy ample support from the demand side, with the urban population likely to remain on a 1-2% annualized growth trajectory over the next 10-15 years.
With Chinese home prices up nearly 50% since 2005 – nearly five times the global norm (according to the Bank for International Settlements and IMF global housing watch) – affordability is obviously a legitimate concern.
The challenge for China is to manage prudently the growth in housing supply needed to satisfy the demand requirements of urbanization, without fostering excessive speculation and dangerous asset bubbles.
Meanwhile the Chinese economy is also drawing support from strong sources of cyclical resilience in early 2017.
The 11.3% year-on-year gain in exports recorded in June stands in sharp contrast with earlier years, which were adversely affected by a weaker post-crisis global recovery.
Similarly, 10% annualized gains in inflation-adjusted retail sales through mid-2017 – about 45% faster than the 6.9% pace of overall GDP growth – reflect impressive growth in household incomes and the increasingly powerful (and possibly under-reported) impetus of e-commerce.
Pessimists have long viewed the Chinese economy as they view their own economies – repeating a classic mistake that Yale historian Jonathan Spence’s seminal assessment warned of many years ago.
The asset bubbles that broke Japan and the United States are widely presumed to pose the same threat in China.
Likewise, China’s recent binge of debt-intensive economic growth is expected to have the same consequences as such episodes elsewhere.
Forecasters find it difficult to resist superimposing the outcomes in major crisis-battered developed economies on China.
That has been the wrong approach in the past; it is wrong again today.
Should China Be Ejected from the SDR?
SANTA BARBARA – Last week, the Chinese government tightened its grip on the renminbi’s exchange rate. China has now effectively reneged on a promise it made 18 months ago, when it lobbied its way into the basket of currencies that determines the value of the International Monetary Fund’s synthetic reserve asset, the Special Drawing Right (SDR).
China’s latest move will hardly strengthen confidence in its currency.
As some of us warned at the time, the renminbi’s admission to the SDR basket was a highly political decision that could have adverse long-term consequences.
The basket had previously comprised the US dollar, the euro, the British pound, and the Japanese yen – all world-class currencies that meet the IMF’s two criteria for admission: they are issued by the world’s leading exporters, and they are “freely usable,” meaning that they are widely exchanged worldwide.
By contrast, the renminbi met only the first criterion when it was included in the SDR.
Although China was already the world’s largest exporting country, its financial markets were primitive, and its currency plainly fell far short of being freely usable.
In 2015, the renminbi ranked seventh in global central-bank reserves, eighth in international bond issuance, and 11th in global currency trading; and it remained non-convertible for most capital-account transactions.
Still, the renminbi was admitted.
China had made it abundantly clear that it would not be happy with a negative decision, and no one wanted to poke the dragon.
But rather than upholding its usual standards, the IMF and its principal members settled for China’s vague promise to make the renminbi more usable sometime in the future.
Historically, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) had fixed the renminbi’s exchange rate on a daily basis, without regard to underlying market sentiment; and it had allowed for the renminbi to trade only within very narrow limits.
But even before the IMF decided to include the renminbi in the SDR, the Chinese government announced that it was loosening its control over the currency.
The PBOC declared that market signals would henceforth be factored into its daily exchange-rate fixing. And it promised gradual liberalization of China’s capital controls, which would boost the renminbi’s attractiveness to investors.
And yet the Chinese authorities’ latest move indicates that they have no intention of playing by the rules.
Instead of further loosening its grip on the exchange rate, the PBOC is reasserting control and reducing the role of market sentiment in its decision-making.
The proof is in the pudding: the renminbi is clearly less freely usable than it was 18 months ago.
Since mid-2016, China has been imposing strict new capital controls to prevent the renminbi from pouring out of the country and being converted into dollars.
China has also placed new limits on Chinese corporations’ foreign direct investments, and it is scrutinizing other cross-border transactions.
It is not difficult to understand why China has reneged on its promises.
Over the past two years, newly affluent Chinese citizens have been seeking ways to move their wealth abroad.
This has increased downward pressure on the renminbi, and has forced the PBOC to spend more than $1 trillion in foreign-exchange reserves to prop up the exchange rate. And yet that still wasn’t enough to prevent Moody’s Investors Service from downgrading China’s credit rating earlier this month, leaving policymakers on the defensive.
Of course, China’s current problems may amount to a brief detour on the long road to greater openness. But they may not.
If the Chinese government is serious about opening its capital market, it will have to implement reforms that go straight to the heart of the Chinese Communist Party’s model of political and economic management.
An efficient, open financial sector could seriously erode the CCP’s authority, not least because financial repression is a key component in China’s machinery of political autocracy.
At best, China’s government acted prematurely when it insisted that the renminbi be included in the SDR.
At worst, it set an unfortunate precedent that could encourage other big emerging economies, such as India or Russia, to demand the same treatment for their currencies, regardless of whether they meet the IMF’s criteria.
Indeed, if China can get into such a prestigious, exclusive club despite its arbitrary policy behavior, then why can’t they?
Never mind that the IMF’s authority would be severely compromised.
Looking to the future, there is only one solution.
The renminbi should be removed from the SDR, unless China can make credible commitments to pursue serious and permanent financial liberalization.
The criterion that a constitutive currency should be freely usable is a guarantee of stability for the global monetary system. That guarantee is only as credible as the criterion itself.
China, the Innovation Dragon
WASHINGTON, DC – China has achieved much since 1978, when Deng Xiaoping initiated the transition to a market economy.
In terms of headline economic progress, the pace of China’s transformation over the past 40 years is unprecedented.
The country’s GDP grew by nearly 10% per year on average, while reshaping global trade patterns and becoming the second-largest economy in the world.
This success lifted 800 million people out of poverty, and the mortality rate of children under five years old was halved between 2006 and 2015.
The question now is whether China, well positioned to become the world’s innovation leader, will realize that opportunity in 2018 or soon after.
China’s transformation has been underpinned by an unprecedented manufacturing boom.
In 2016, China shipped more than $2 trillion worth of goods around the world, 13% of total global exports.
It has also pursued economic modernization through massive infrastructure investment, including bridges, airports, roads, energy, and telecoms.
In less than a decade, China built the world’s largest bullet train system, surpassing 22,000 kilometers (13,670 miles) in July 2017.
Annual consumption is expected to rise by nearly $2 trillion by 2021, equivalent to adding another consumer market the size of Germany to the global economy.
Earlier this month, Apple CEO Tim Cook declared that, “China stopped being a low-labor-cost country many years ago, and that is not the reason to come to China.”
The country’s manufacturing strengths now lie in its advanced production know-how and strong supply-chain networks.
Understandably, China’s leadership wants to increase productivity and continue to move further up the value chain.
Building on its 13th Five Year Plan (in May 2016), the authorities established objectives for China to become an “innovative nation” by 2020, an “international innovation leader” by 2030, and a “world powerhouse of scientific and technological innovation” by 2050.
It also committed to increasing its expenditure on research and development to 2.5% of GDP and almost doubling the number of patents filed per 10,000 people by 2020.
To enable this innovation, municipal governments are building technology hubs, hoping to attract talent.
The city of Guangzhou is encouraging researchers, entrepreneurs, and corporations to base themselves there.
General Electric recently committed to build its first Asian biopharmaceutical project in an $800 million bio-campus.
The southern city of Shenzhen is already known as the “Silicon Valley of Hardware,” and the greater Shenzhen-Hong Kong area is ranked second in terms of global inventive clusters (measured by patents).
Business in China often operates at a speed and nimbleness unlike anywhere else in the world.
China is fully embracing digital models, not just digitizing old models.
Its lack of legacy systems has already enabled it to leapfrog the West in areas such as digital payments, the sharing economy (dockless bicycles are sweeping the world), and e-commerce.
Total spending on R&D in China (as a percentage of GDP) more than doubled from 0.9% in 2000 to 2.1% in 2016.
To date, the increase has mostly been focused on applied research and commercial development, with only 5% dedicated to basic science.
Nevertheless, China ranked 22nd in the 2017 Global Innovation Index (a survey of 127 countries and economies based on 81 indicators) ahead of Spain, Italy, and Australia.
China’s share of high-impact academic publications (the top 0.1% of papers in Scopus, which rates by citations) has grown, from less than 1% in 1997 to about 20% in 2016.
The sheer volume of university graduates (6.2 million in 2012, six times the 2001 total) combined with an internationally trained, highly skilled diaspora whose members return home in large numbers – there are 800,000 Chinese students in tertiary education abroad – is likely to produce enough talent to achieve the desired effect.
American workers are still considerably more productive than their Chinese counterparts.
On average, each Chinese worker generates only about 19% of the amount of GDP that an American worker does.
But this lead is being eroded.
Other factors in America’s favor include 30 of the top 100 universities in the world, a risk-taking, entrepreneurial culture, and its companies’ heavy exposure to market forces.
Traditionally, this has driven US firms to compete aggressively, often relying on innovation.
But American industry is not as dynamic as it once was.
Between 1997 and 2012, two-thirds of America’s industries experienced an increase in market concentration, and a record 74% of employees are working at these aging (16 years or older) incumbents.
US President Donald Trump’s administration seems to have completely misunderstood what is needed.
Trump favors a more protectionist future, which would take the pressure off US companies to be globally competitive or truly innovative.
American universities are being undermined by changes in the tax code and impending spending cuts – part of what appears to be a broader war on science.
And immigration – an essential source of talent and ideas – looks likely to be restricted.
Given its own policies, and those of the US, China is on track to become the world’s innovation leader.
By the end of 2018, it will be more apparent just how quickly and easily this latest chapter in the Chinese success story will be written.
Calling the Chinese Bully’s Bluff
NEW DELHI – The more power China has accumulated, the more it has attempted to achieve its foreign-policy objectives with bluff, bluster, and bullying.
But, as its Himalayan border standoff with India’s military continues, the limits of this approach are becoming increasingly apparent.
The current standoff began in mid-June, when Bhutan, a close ally of India, discovered the People’s Liberation Army trying to extend a road through Doklam, a high-altitude plateau in the Himalayas that belongs to Bhutan, but is claimed by China.
India, which guarantees tiny Bhutan’s security, quickly sent troops and equipment to halt the construction, asserting that the road – which would overlook the point where Tibet, Bhutan, and the Indian state of Sikkim meet – threatened its own security.
Since then, China’s leaders have been warning India almost daily to back down or face military reprisals.
China’s defense ministry has threatened to teach India a “bitter lesson,” vowing that any conflict would inflict “greater losses” than the Sino-Indian War of 1962, when China invaded India during a Himalayan border dispute and inflicted major damage within a few weeks.
Likewise, China’s foreign ministry has unleashed a torrent of vitriol intended to intimidate India into submission.
Despite all of this, India’s government, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has kept its cool, refusing to respond to any Chinese threat, much less withdraw its forces.
As China’s warmongering has continued, its true colors have become increasingly vivid.
It is now clear that China is attempting to use psychological warfare (“psywar”) to advance its strategic objectives – to “win without fighting,” as the ancient Chinese military theorist Sun Tzu recommended.
China has waged its psywar against India largely through disinformation campaigns and media manipulation, aimed at presenting India – a raucous democracy with poor public diplomacy – as the aggressor and China as the aggrieved party.
Chinese state media have been engaged in eager India-bashing for weeks.
China has also employed “lawfare,” selectively invoking a colonial-era accord, while ignoring its own violations – cited by Bhutan and India – of more recent bilateral agreements.
For the first few days of the standoff, China’s psywar blitz helped it dominate the narrative.
But, as China’s claims and tactics have come under growing scrutiny, its approach has faced diminishing returns.
In fact, from a domestic perspective, China’s attempts to portray itself as the victim – claiming that Indian troops had illegally entered Chinese territory, where they remain – has been distinctly damaging, provoking a nationalist backlash over the failure to evict the intruders.
As a result, President Xi Jinping’s image as a commanding leader, along with the presumption of China’s regional dominance, is coming under strain, just months before the critical 19th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).
And it is difficult to see how Xi could turn the situation around.
Despite China’s overall military superiority, it is scarcely in a position to defeat India decisively in a Himalayan war, given India’s fortified defenses along the border.
Even localized hostilities at the tri-border area would be beyond China’s capacity to dominate, because the Indian army controls higher terrain and has greater troop density.
If such military clashes left China with so much as a bloodied nose, as happened in the same area in 1967, it could spell serious trouble for Xi at the upcoming National Congress.
But, even without actual conflict, China stands to lose.
Its confrontational approach could drive India, Asia’s most important geopolitical “swing state,” firmly into the camp of the United States, China’s main global rival.
It could also undermine its own commercial interests in the world’s fastest-growing major economy, which sits astride China’s energy-import lifeline.
Already, Indian Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj has tacitly warned of economic sanctions if China, which is running an annual trade surplus of nearly $60 billion with India, continues to disturb border peace.
More broadly, as China has declared unconditional Indian troop withdrawal to be a “prerequisite” for ending the standoff, India, facing recurrent Chinese incursions over the last decade, has insisted that border peace is a “prerequisite” for developing bilateral ties.
Against this background, the smartest move for Xi would be to attempt to secure India’s help in finding a face-saving compromise to end the crisis.
The longer the standoff lasts, the more likely it is to sully Xi’s carefully cultivated image as a powerful leader, and that of China as Asia’s hegemon, which would undermine popular support for the regime at home and severely weaken China’s influence over its neighbors.
Already, the standoff is offering important lessons to other Asian countries seeking to cope with China’s bullying.
For example, China recently threatened to launch military action against Vietnam’s outposts in the disputed Spratly Islands, forcing the Vietnamese government to stop drilling for gas at the edge of China’s exclusive economic zone in the South China Sea.
China does not yet appear ready to change its approach.
Some experts even predict that it will soon move forward with a “small-scale military operation” to expel the Indian troops currently in its claimed territory.
But such an attack is unlikely to do China any good, much less change the territorial status quo in the tri-border area.
It certainly won’t make it possible for China to resume work on the road it wanted to build.
That dream most likely died when India called the Chinese bully’s bluff.
Trumpism Down Under
SYDNEY – Thirty years ago, a colleague of mine in the British government who had ministerial responsibilities in Africa and Asia hung the world map in his office upside down.
Placing what was then called the Third World at the top, he claimed, improved his understanding of those countries’ problems and perspectives.
But, for the British, the real “down under” – the country you would reach if you turned the world on its head – is Australia.
Schoolchildren used to be taught that, if you dug a straight tunnel through the planet, Australia is where you would end up.
Their seasons were the opposite of ours, as were the days – a point that was driven home when, in the early morning hours, we listened to cricket commentaries from Brisbane or Adelaide.
While Britain slept, the Aussies played in the sunshine.
Australia is a beautiful and prosperous country, with a grand landscape and fine cities, most notably Sydney and Melbourne.
It is a rumbustious democracy with a profound appreciation of the rule of law, a free and open society that has provided a haven for immigrants and refugees from all over the world.
While its past treatment of its indigenous population has undoubtedly been problematic, it has had the courage and maturity to acknowledge unpleasant truths.
Yet this admirable country now faces an existential challenge.
As Australia’s relationship with the United States comes under increasing strain, its political dynamics are becoming increasingly complex and perilous.
For decades, Australia has had a close partnership with the US, not least in security terms.
But, in his year since taking office, President Donald Trump has not only challenged ties with many of America’s traditional allies; he has also worked actively to undermine the systems of global and regional cooperation that the US itself spearheaded and underwrote.
He has reversed his predecessors’ hard-won progress in building relationships and striking mutually beneficial deals, including the Iran nuclear agreement, the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, and the Paris climate agreement.
Contrary to Trump’s claims that his policies will “Make America Great Again,” he is deeply compromising his country’s role in the world.
Long-standing allies regret that the US, a country they have long admired, is now being steered by a mendacious, untrustworthy diplomatic arsonist.
This is bad news for Australia, which would clearly like to build a stronger partnership with regional powers that share its democratic values and interests, including India, Japan, and the US.
Such an alliance would not seek to contain China, but to ensure that it does not abuse its power and stoke regional tensions and instability.
Without a reliable regional counterweight, that is exactly what China seems eager to do.
Like Trump, Chinese President Xi Jinping has reversed many of his predecessors’ policies, including some of the market-oriented reforms pushed through by Deng Xiaoping.
Having cultivated a Mao-style cult of personality, Xi proclaims that the time has come to Make China Great Again.
So foreign-policy restraint has gone out the window, and Xi has enabled the Communist Party of China to reassert its control over the economy.
Free enterprise is now once again subordinated to the public sector.
The “Communist united front” has been let off its leash.
Every Communist regime since the Russian Revolution of 1917 has sought to use the “united front” to extend the power of the party, both at home and abroad, in ways that may be subtle or overt, but are invariably underhanded.
Today’s Chinese united front is no exception, and Australia is one of the countries that is being targeted.
Australia has strong economic ties with China, which buys much of what it mines and grows.
For its own part, China has exported money and people to Australia, from the business world to academia.
Most Chinese in Australia, some of whom regard their new home as a haven from repression and corruption, have become enthusiastic Australians with a proud Chinese heritage.
But a few Chinese in Australia have allowed themselves to become foot soldiers of China’s Leninist (not really communist) dictatorship, manipulated by Chinese diplomats and a few businessmen.
The effects of their activities can be seen in the conduct of foreign policy and in attempts to mobilize votes against the government.
Now Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull’s administration has responded to this activity, introducing legislation that bans foreign donations to political parties and activist groups, including some charities, and requires former politicians, lobbyists, and executives working for foreign interests to register if they are to be involved in Australian politics.
The move is explicitly intended to prevent foreign – and, specifically, Chinese – interference in Australia’s democratic life.
Turnbull’s crackdown on foreign interference in domestic politics amounts to a bold attempt to strengthen Australia’s position in the global South.
The country, Turnbull is making clear, is prepared to be a friend to China, but it will not be bullied or manipulated.
A united front of democracies would certainly help get that point across.
But, beyond failing to support Australia, Trump’s antics are actually undermining Turnbull’s effort.
Australia, like so many other traditional allies, surely yearns for the day when Trump, with his crude and self-defeating nationalism, can no longer harm his own country and others.
A Chinese Model for Foreign Aid
SINGAPORE – Last month, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation released a status report tracking progress on the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
The data, which were meant to highlight efforts to eradicate extreme poverty and reduce premature deaths, was also intended to cajole.
Countries can, and must, do more to address the global development challenges that the planet collectively faces, the report concluded.
No country was singled out in the Gates report for its potential to restore the “world’s commitment to development.”
Rather, “leaders everywhere” bear responsibility for ensuring that the SDGs are met by 2030.
But we believe there is one country that can do more than others to build the world envisaged by the SDGs: China.
Two years into the SDG program, international development is at a crossroads.
The United States, long the torchbearer of foreign aid, is retreating; so is Europe (albeit to a lesser extent).
But China, with its newly articulated global ambitions, has an opportunity to reinvigorate the conception and delivery of humanitarian assistance.
Adopted by the UN General Assembly in 2015, the SDGs outline a vision for global development that targets poverty, education, public health, inequality, sustainability, and climate action over the next 15 years.
It presents a broad vision for development, whereby issues once viewed as country-specific are treated as challenges for the entire world to tackle collectively.
By contrast, the Millennium Development Goals, which ended in 2015, were more narrowly focused, and primarily targeted at issues affecting poor countries.
But the Gates’ study suggests that some of the SDG targets are already in jeopardy.
For example, the health goal (SDG 3), which includes a target for eliminating preventable deaths among newborns and children, is unlikely to be achieved in the allotted timeframe.
At the current pace, mortality reduction in South Asia and Africa will not be realized until mid-century.
Clearly, more investment is needed globally in the types of interventions that have proven effective locally.
Ethiopia’s Health Extension Worker program and Malawi’s Health Surveillance Assistant program have been proven to reduce child mortality.
Aid dollars should be earmarked to help programs like these expand to other regions.
Instead, the opposite is happening.
The growing isolationism associated with the populist backlash around the world is having severe consequences for foreign assistance.
According to the OECD, bilateral aid to the world’s least-developed countries fell by nearly 4% in 2016.
This is an alarming drop for these countries, given that official development assistance (ODA) accounts for more than two thirds of the aid they receive.
The US, which remains the world’s largest donor for nutrition programs and for maternal and child health initiatives, is leading the funding retreat.
President Donald Trump’s 2017 budget proposal includes a staggering 45% cut to funding by the US Agency for International Development for water and sanitation projects, a 26% cut to global health funding, and the elimination of funds for family planning.
While it is not clear whether Congress will support Trump’s budget request, which would amount to billions of dollars in lost aid, even a minor reduction in US aid spending would hurt many of the world’s poorest.
The US is not alone in its foreign aid retrenchment.
The European Union’s 2018 draft budget proposes a €90 million ($106 million) cut to development spending, while Austria, Germany, and Italy have all diverted development assistance budgets towards migration crises viewed as imminent national security threats.
These are troubling trends, because private philanthropy cannot replace aid withdrawn by governments.
The world needs a new champion for international development, and China should assume the role.
With weakening ODA commitments from traditional donors, China has a chance to lead in human development, poverty alleviation, and public health spending.
It is true that China’s aid model differs from the West’s.
Europe and the US have historically focused on funding health care and education initiatives, while encouraging civil-society growth and participation.
China, on the other hand, grants aid on a bilateral basis, and has typically targeted its funding toward infrastructure projects.
But Chinese leaders have also recently shown interest in aid to strengthen civil society and improve livelihoods.
Although Chinese ODA is still a fraction of what OECD countries spend, China has signaled its interest in becoming a development leader, especially in the health sector.
At the 2015 UN Sustainable Development Summit in New York, China pledged $2 billion to help implement the SDG agenda, and China’s flagship “Belt and Road Initiative” includes health cooperation as part of its proposed strategy.
In 2014, China also committed $47 million to help contain the Ebola outbreak in West Africa.
While that was significantly lower than the US pledge of $1.8 billion, China was among the fastest to deliver on its commitment.
China’s geopolitical and economic influence is growing, and so, too, must its role in promoting international peace and development.
Skepticism about China’s development intentions will no doubt emerge, given China’s political and ideological differences with the West.
But the skepticism could yield positive results, especially if it prompts Western powers to reevaluate their foreign aid retreat.
Even if it does not, China has the tools to become a leader in international development.
And, having lifted some 470 million of its own citizens out of extreme poverty between 1990 and 2005, it also has the experience.
But, more than anything, China now has the political opportunity.
As the US and Europe turn inward, ensuring the SDGs’ success will increasingly depend on encouraging – and becoming accustomed to – Chinese leadership.
The Global Economy’s New Rule-Maker
MILAN – In a recent commentary for the South China Morning Post, Helen Wong, HSBC’s chief executive for Greater China, shows that China’s rising generation of 400 million young consumers will soon account for more than half of the country’s domestic consumption.
This generation, Wong notes, is largely transacting online, through innovative, integrated mobile platforms, indicating that it has already “leapt from the pre­web era straight to the mobile Internet, skipping the personal computer altogether.”
Of course, China’s rising middle class is not news.
But the extent to which digitally oriented younger consumers are driving rapid growth in China’s service industries has not yet received ample attention.
Services, after all, will help drive China’s structural transition from a middle- to a high-income economy.
Not too long ago, many pundits doubted that China could make the shift from an economy dominated by labor-intensive manufacturing, exports, infrastructure investment, and heavy industry to a service economy underpinned by domestic demand.
But even if China’s economic transition is far from complete, its progress has been impressive.
In recent years, China has been offloading its labor-intensive export sectors to less-developed countries with lower labor costs.
And in other sectors, it has shifted to more digital, capital-intensive forms of production, rendering labor-cost disadvantages insignificant.
These trends imply that supply-side growth has become less dependent on external markets.
As a result of these changes, China’s economic power is rapidly rising.
Its domestic market is growing fast, and could soon be the largest in the world.
And because the Chinese government can control access to that market, it can increasingly exert its influence in Asia and beyond.
At the same time, China’s declining dependence on export-led growth is reducing its vulnerability to the whims of those who control access to global markets.
But China does not actually need to limit access to its own markets to sustain its growth, because it can increase its bargaining power by merely threatening to do so.
This suggests that China’s position in the global economy is starting to resemble that of the United States during the post-war period, when it, along with Europe, was the dominant economic power.
For decades after World War II, Europe and the US represented well over half (and near 70% at one point) of global output, and they were not heavily dependent on markets elsewhere, other than for natural resources such as oil and minerals.
Now, China is rapidly approaching a similar configuration.
It has a very large domestic market – to which it can control access – rising incomes, and high aggregate demand; and its growth model is increasingly based on domestic consumption and investment, and less on exports.
But how will China wield its increasing economic power?
In the post-war period, the advanced economies used their position to set the rules for global economic activity.
They did so in such a way as to benefit themselves, of course; but they also tried to be as inclusive as possible for developing countries.
The post-war powers certainly did not have to take that approach. It was within their power to focus far more narrowly on their own interests.
But that might not have been wise.
It is worth remembering that in the twentieth century, following two world wars, peace was the top priority, along with – or even before – prosperity.
China shows every sign of moving in the same direction.
It most likely will not pursue a narrowly self-interested approach, mainly because to do so would diminish its global stature and clout.
China has shown that it wants to be influential in the developing world – and certainly in Asia – by playing the role of a supportive partner, at least in the economic realm.
Whether China can achieve that goal will depend on what it does in two key policy areas.
The first is investment, where China has moved aggressively by introducing a variety of multilateral and bilateral initiatives.
For example, in addition to investing heavily in African countries, it created the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank in 2015, and, in 2013, announced the “Belt and Road Initiative,” meant to integrate Eurasia through massive investments in highways, ports, and rail transport.
Second, how China manages access to its vast internal market, in terms of trade and investment, will have far-reaching consequences for all of China’s external economic partners, not just developing countries.
China’s domestic market is now the source of its power, which means that the choices it makes in this area in the near term will largely determine its global standing for decades to come.
To be sure, China’s current position on domestic-market access is less clear than its economic ambitions abroad.
But China will most likely move toward an open, largely rules-based multilateral framework.
The lesson from the post-war period is that this approach will do the most good externally, and will thus enhance China’s international influence.
At this stage of China’s development, such an approach will have few if any costs, while most likely conferring many benefits.
What remains to be seen is how China’s relationship with the US fares.
The US is suffering from non-inclusive growth patterns and related political and social upheavals. And it now seems to be departing from its historical post-war approach to international economic policy.
But even if the US is isolating itself under President Donald Trump, it is still too big simply to ignore.
If the Trump administration enacts aggressive policies directed at China, the Chinese will have no choice but to respond.
Still, in the meantime, China can continue to pursue a rules-based multilateral approach, and it can expect broad support from other advanced and developing countries.
The key is not to be distracted by America’s descent into nationalism.
After all, it is anyone’s guess how long that will last.
Soviet Lessons for Chinese Purges
CLAREMONT, CALIFORNIA – On August 1, China’s People’s Liberation Army celebrated its 88th anniversary.
But the country’s 2.3 million soldiers have little to cheer about.
On the eve of the anniversary, the PLA’s former top general, Guo Boxiong, was unceremoniously booted out of the Communist Party and handed over to military prosecutors to face corruption charges, including allegations that he took large bribes from fellow PLA officers in exchange for promotions.
And Guo will not be the last PLA officer to face such charges.
Guo, a vice chairman of the Central Military Commission, was in charge of the military’s day-to-day affairs from 2002 to 2012.
His arrest follows that of General Xu Caihou, who served on the commission from 2007 to 2012, in June of last year.
Guo and Xu are not the only senior officers to have fallen since their commander-in-chief, President Xi Jinping, launched his war on corruption at the end of 2012.
Based on official data, 39 generals (including Guo’s son, a major general) have already been arrested.
And if there is merit to the allegations that a large number of generals bribed Guo and Xu for their promotions, it is reasonable to assume that the most wide-ranging purge of senior PLA officers since the Cultural Revolution will continue.
That is precisely the message Xi sent to the military in a recent speech to the 16th army group, for which Xu served as political commissar in the early 1990s.
After vowing to eradicate Xu’s influence, “ideologically, politically, and also in terms of organization and work style,” Xi stressed that disobedience to the Party leadership would not be tolerated.
The army must, Xi declared, “resolutely conform to orders from the party Central Committee and the Central Military Commission.”
Anyone who has been watching Xi over the last two and a half years could discern his goal of consolidating Communist Party rule in China by strengthening his personal authority, reinvigorating domestic repression, and pursuing an assertive foreign policy.
To achieve this goal, Xi needs to secure the PLA’s unimpeachable loyalty – and that requires the purge of unreliable or corrupt officers.
On a personal level, the PLA’s loyalty is vital to make up for Xi’s lack of an institutional power base.
By contrast, when former President Jiang Zemin became General Secretary of the Communist Party following the Tiananmen crackdown in 1989, he was able to rely on capable and loyal officials in Shanghai to run the bureaucracy; he then expanded his support base by co-opting other factions in the 1990s.
And Jiang’s successor, Hu Jintao, hailed from the Communist Youth League, which has alumni at all levels of the party-state.
While Xi will work to build a strong power base by gradually appointing his supporters to key positions, he needs the PLA to defend his political authority in the interim.
The most efficient way for Xi to secure the PLA’s loyalty is to replace its top generals – most of whom were promoted by previous presidents – with his own supporters.
It seems that the lesson from the fall of Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev in 1964 was not lost on Xi.
Khrushchev was ousted in a palace coup sponsored by the KGB and blessed by the military.
Had the Red Army been completely loyal to Khrushchev, the conspirators would not have succeeded.
But Xi’s plans extend beyond his personal authority – and so do the lessons of the Soviet Union.
Shortly after Xi’s assumption of power, he lamented to local officials in Guangdong that when the Soviet Union collapsed, the elite had lost the will to fight.
At a time when the Chinese Communist Party’s political monopoly is increasingly being challenged, Xi will not make that mistake.
To avoid the Soviet Union’s fate, Xi and his colleagues have re-imposed ideological control and curtailed civil liberties.
While the Party has so far employed only the police and Internet censors (and now wants to embed secret policemen within all Internet companies), its longer-term survival is inconceivable without a loyal PLA, especially if protests like that in Tiananmen Square in 1989 erupt again.
The final pillar of Xi’s strategy for solidifying the Communist Party’s authority is to replace Deng Xiaoping’s cautious foreign policy with a muscular one.
Should China have to back its aggressive tactics in, say, the South China Sea or the Taiwan Strait with force, its military must not be led by venal and perfidious generals.
If Xi’s efforts to root out corruption in the PLA can accomplish these three objectives, one must grudgingly admit that it will be a stroke of political genius.
But, to ensure that China is in the strongest possible position, Xi must learn one more lesson from the Soviets: Purges can easily lead to excesses.
Stalin annihilated the Red Army’s officer corps on the eve of Nazi Germany’s invasion.
Xi cannot afford to make the same mistake.
China’s Solitary Development Model
BERKELEY – It seems that China’s leaders have now forsaken Deng Xiaoping’s advice to tao guang yang hui (“keep a low profile”).
In declaring a “new era” for China during October’s 19th National Congress in Beijing, President Xi Jinping presented the Chinese system of governance as a model for other countries to emulate.
Leaders who “want to speed up their development while preserving their independence,” Xi said, should look to China as “a new option.”
Developing countries, particularly in Southeast Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa, seem awestruck by this possibility.
China’s official news agency, Xinhua, has even suggested that as the West’s democracies falter, “enlightened Chinese democracy” could offer a path forward.
Amid all the lofty rhetoric, it is worth asking: what, precisely, is the Chinese model of economic and political development?
And, is it actually preferable to the alternatives?
China’s model comprises a number of key characteristics, including authoritarian governance buttressed by the perception of stability; state-guided industrial policy and finance; massive infrastructure investments; rural industrialization backed by small-scale agriculture; and openness to foreign trade and technology.
This model has, no doubt, produced rapid economic growth in China over the last three decades, lifting hundreds of millions of people out of poverty.
But the implication that the first ingredient – authoritarianism – is necessary for rapid development misses the mark.
In fact, it is this characteristic of the Chinese system that should give other countries the greatest pause.
Consider China’s East Asian neighbors – in particular, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan.
Each has achieved high growth through state-guided industrial policy, rural industrialization, and openness to trade.
But Japan achieved these objectives within the framework of its postwar democracy, while South Korea and Taiwan have been democracies for three decades.
Authoritarianism, in other words, served no necessary modernizing role.
Democracy is, to be sure, exasperatingly slow and often contentious.
But its deliberative and electoral processes help mitigate conflicts, especially in heterogeneous and conflict-ridden societies.
Even in a more homogeneous country like China, the absence of open public discourse does the opposite, as evidenced by the state’s mishandling of ethnic unrest among Tibetans and Uighurs.
Without a strong civil society or an independent judiciary to check government power, Chinese leaders have, on many occasions, made catastrophic errors in judgment.
Look no further than Mao Zedong’s Great Leap Forward or the Cultural Revolution.
Xi, too, has blundered.
For example, his decision to order China’s state-owned enterprises (SOEs) to prop up China’s falling stock market in 2015 was an epic miscalculation.
Once foreign exchange reserves held by the People’s Bank of China stopped flowing to struggling SOEs, the market fell to the same low levels as before intervention.
By that point, hundreds of billions of dollars had been wasted.
The absence of political checks and institutional mechanisms for public scrutiny has also encouraged abuse of power and high levels of corruption, contributing to high inequality, arbitrary land grabs, unsafe working conditions, food safety scares, and toxic pollution, among other problems.
While Xi’s energetic anti-corruption efforts may stem some injustices, without fundamental political reform, his campaign against dishonest party officials is likely to be a Sisyphean task – when it is not merely a ploy to curb potential political rivals.
Economic management suffers from similar opacity.
At the moment, there are few, if any, checks on debt-fueled investment by SOEs or politically connected firms.
This shortcoming, to the extent that it results in massive misallocation of capital, is and will remain a source of major macroeconomic uncertainty for China.
As China’s economy becomes more complex, the absence of transparent and accountable governance processes, combined with frequent crackdowns on civil society and efforts to enforce conformity and discipline, will ultimately stifle entrepreneurship and innovation.
It does not help that, while China’s expenditure on research and development as a share of GDP is now quite high, much of it is in the public sector.
If the SOEs remain too-big-to-fail, this will create a further drag on innovation.
As China graduates from the “catch-up” phase of economic development, addressing this constraint will only become more important.
The lack of openness and transparency could also test political stability.
In the face of crisis, China’s leaders often overreact by repressing dissent.
Collective and pragmatic leadership in recent decades has done a reasonable job of managing the problem, but Xi’s consolidation of power, and the cult of personality surrounding him, could exacerbate instability.
Democratic governments, for all their messiness, are less fragile, as they draw their legitimacy from pluralism and political contestation, rather than from high economic growth or nationalist appeals.
Judicial decisions overturning President Donald Trump’s arbitrary travel bans in the United States, or similar rebukes of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s attempts to criminalize dissent, are examples of how institutional autonomy strengthens the resilience of democratic political systems – resilience that China lacks.
Despite the official narrative, most of the features of the Chinese system of governance that Xi has championed have little to do with him.
They are vestiges of China’s imperial or early communist governments: a performance-based meritocratic promotion system; an organizational framework that ensures top-down loyalty without compromising the quality of local governance; and a unique system of political centralization combined with economic and administrative decentralization.
In other words, for all its allure, the Chinese model is deficient in some basic respects, and not easily reproducible in others.
Any country that takes to heart Xi’s invitation to emulate China but does not have a similar organizational history will likely be unsatisfied.
Not only is China politically unique, but it also possesses a large and increasingly prosperous domestic market that enables it to lure foreign investment on its own terms.
So, no matter what the Middle Kingdom’s newest emperor might claim, development with Chinese characteristics is really only for China.
Moving From Debt to Equity in China
HONG KONG – A spate of recent commentary has been warning of the vertiginous rise in China’s debt, which jumped from 148% of GDP in 2007 to 249% at the end of the third quarter of 2015.
Many are anxiously pointing out that China’s debt is now comparable to that of the European Union (270% of GDP) and the United States (248% of GDP).
Are they right to worry?
To some extent, they are.
But while observers’ concerns are not entirely baseless, it is far too early to sound the systemic-risk alarm.
As a recent HSBC report points out, the reasons for China’s rapid accumulation of debt, which is concentrated in the corporate and local-government sectors, suggest that the situation is not nearly as dangerous as many are making it out to be.
For starters, China has a very high saving rate – above 45% over the last decade, much higher than in the advanced economies – which enables it to sustain higher debt levels.
Moreover, China’s banking system remains the primary channel for the deployment of the household sector’s savings, meaning that those savings fund corporate investment through bank lending, rather than equity financing (which accounts for only about 5% of net investment).
Indeed, the sharp acceleration in the debt-to-GDP ratio is partly attributable to the relative underdevelopment of China’s capital market.
Once these factors are taken into account, China’s overall debt levels do not seem abnormally high.
While debt might be a problem for Chinese companies with excess capacity and low productivity, companies in fast-growing, productive sectors and regions may not be in too much trouble.
More generally, China has made recent progress in boosting labor productivity, encouraging technological innovation, and improving service quality in key urban areas, despite severe financial repression and inadequate access to funding by small and medium-size private enterprises.
Of course, China’s debt is still rising – a trend that, if left unchecked, could pose a mounting threat to financial and economic stability.
But the structure of China’s national balance sheet suggests that it still has plenty of room to mitigate the risks that escalating debt might bring.
Thanks to China’s high saving rate, the country’s banking system had a loan-to-deposit ratio of 74% at the end of 2015, with 17.5% in required reserves held at the central bank.
The capital adequacy ratio was as high as 13.2%.
Given that China’s net external lending position amounts to $1.8 trillion, or 17.2% of GDP, the central bank has enough liquidity to reduce banks’ reserve requirements without resorting to unconventional monetary policy.
Furthermore, after more than three decades of rapid income growth, China has accumulated wealth (or net assets) in almost all sectors.
By any standard, China’s household sector has very low leverage, with a debt-to-deposit ratio of 47.6%.
Even the corporate sector’s leverage is not as high as many reports suggest.
Household deposits accounted for 40.1% of total bank deposits of CN¥146.5 trillion ($22.5 trillion) at end-March 2016, while non-financial corporations comprised 32.1% and the share of government deposits was 17.1%.
The combined debt-deposit ratio of the non-financial corporate sector and the government sector was 97.6%, meaning that these sectors’ total deposits exceeded their debts to the banking system by CN¥1.7 trillion.
In addition, the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences estimates that the central and local governments have accumulated net assets amounting to nearly 146% of GDP, mostly in real estate.
In short, while China has a problem with inefficient capital allocation, it is nowhere near a solvency or liquidity crisis.
Nonetheless, China does need to address its domestic debt overhang.
One option is higher inflation.
But advanced countries have learned the hard way in recent years how difficult this approach can be, as their massive unconventional monetary policies have failed to overcome deflationary forces.
With much of the world facing very low inflation, and even the possibility of outright decline in the price level, the real burden of debt has been increasing.
A second option is to issue more equity.
The banking system is the wrong channel for allocating resources to high-growth, high-risk sectors, which should hold equity as risk capital.
But last year’s A-share debacle – when a price rout drove the government to suspend trading in more than half of A-share companies – underscored how difficult it is to build a strong equity market when the investment culture and tax system remain tilted toward debt.
But China still has options.
A substantial share of the corporations holding large debts are state-owned, and are thus more subject to policy than they are to markets.
Simply put, the government has the power to bring about balance-sheet changes.
The key will be to encourage the reduction of bad debts and increases in the stock of safe assets, while taxing excess capacity and encouraging innovation, thereby improving total factor productivity.
Giacomo Corneo of the Free University of Berlin has proposed that, in addition to taxing underused real estate, China should create a sovereign wealth fund to improve the management of public assets.
Given that those assets amount to an estimated $18 trillion, a higher return on capital would boost GDP and reduce debt.
China’s bank regulators have already permitted experiments in debt-equity swaps, which the International Monetary Fund says should be incorporated in a comprehensive strategy to accelerate reform of state-owned enterprises.
China has the savings to address its growing debt burden.
Amid slowing growth, however, its window of opportunity is narrowing.
The sooner China rebalances from debt to equity, the better off it will be.
A New Front in Asia’s Water War
NEW DELHI – China has long regarded freshwater as a strategic weapon – one that the country’s leaders have no compunction about wielding to advance their foreign-policy goals.
After years of using its chokehold on almost every major transnational river system in Asia to manipulate water flows themselves, China is now withholding data on upstream flows to put pressure on downstream countries, particularly India.
For decades, China has been dragging its neighbors into high-stakes games of geopolitical poker over water-related issues.
Thanks to its forcible annexation of Tibet and other non-Han Chinese ethnic homelands – territories that comprise some 60% of its landmass – China is the world’s unrivaled hydro-hegemon.
It is the source of cross-border riparian flows to more countries than any other state.
In recent years, China has worked hard to exploit that status to increase its leverage over its neighbors, relentlessly building upstream dams on international rivers.
China is now home to more dams than the rest of the world combined, and the construction continues, leaving downstream neighbors – especially the vulnerable lower Mekong basin states, Nepal, and Kazakhstan – essentially at China’s mercy.
So far, China has refused to enter into a water-sharing treaty with a single country.
It does, however, share some hydrological and meteorological data – essential to enable downstream countries to foresee and plan for floods, thereby protecting lives and reducing material losses.
Yet, this year, China decided to withhold such data from India, undermining the efficacy of India’s flood early-warning systems – during Asia’s summer monsoon season, no less.
As a result, despite below-normal monsoon rains this year in India’s northeast, through which the Brahmaputra River flows after leaving Tibet and before entering Bangladesh, the region faced unprecedented flooding, with devastating consequences, especially in Assam state.
China’s decision to withhold crucial data is not only cruel; it also breaches the country’s international obligations.
China is one of just three countries that voted against the 1997 United Nations Watercourse Convention, which called for the regular exchange of hydrological and other data between co-basin states.
But China did enter into a five-year bilateral accord, which expires next year, requiring it to transfer to India hydrological and meteorological data daily from three Brahmaputra-monitoring stations in Tibet during the risky flood season, from May 15 to October 15.
A similar agreement, reached in 2015, covers the Sutlej, another flood-prone river.
Both accords arose after flash floods linked to suspected discharges from Chinese projects in Tibet repeatedly ravaged India’s Arunachal and Himachal states.
Unlike some other countries, which offer hydrological data to their downstream counterparts for free, China does so only for a price.
(The Watercourse Convention would have required that no charges be levied, unless the data or information was “not readily available” – a rule that may also have contributed to China’s “no” vote.)
But it was a price India was willing to pay.
And this year, as always, India sent the agreed amount.
Yet it received no data, with the Chinese foreign ministry claiming after almost four months that upstream stations were being “upgraded” or “renovated.”
That claim was spurious: China did supply data on the Brahmaputra to Bangladesh.
Three weeks earlier, the state-controlled newspaper Global Times offered a more plausible explanation for China’s failure to deliver the promised data to India: the data transfer had been intentionally halted, owing to India’s supposed infringement on Chinese territorial sovereignty in a dispute over the remote Himalayan region of Doklam.
For much of the summer, that dispute took the form of a border standoff where Bhutan, Tibet, and the Indian state of Sikkim meet.
But even before the dispute flared in mid-June, China was seething over India’s boycott of its May 14-15 summit promoting the much-vaunted “Belt and Road” initiative.
The denial of data apparently began as an attempt to punish India for condemning China’s massive, cross-border infrastructure agenda as an opaque, neocolonial enterprise.
China’s desire to punish India was then reinforced by the Doklam standoff.
For China, it seems, international agreements stop being binding when they are no longer politically convenient.
This reading is reinforced by China’s violations of its 1984 pact with the United Kingdom, under which China gained sovereignty over Hong Kong in 1997.
China claims that the agreement, based on the formula “one country, two systems,” had lost “practical significance” over the last 20 years.
Were the roles reversed, a downstream China would have stridently accused an upstream India of exacerbating flood-related death and destruction by breaching its international obligations.
But just as China has unilaterally and aggressively asserted its territorial and maritime claims in Asia, it is using the reengineering of cross-border riparian flows and denial of hydrological data to deepen its regional power.
In fact, China’s cutoff of water data, despite the likely impact on vulnerable civilian communities, sets a dangerous precedent of indifference to humanitarian considerations.
It also highlights how China is fashioning unconventional tools of coercive diplomacy, whose instruments already range from informally boycotting goods from a targeted country to halting strategic exports (such as of rare-earth minerals) and suspending Chinese tourist travel.
Now, by seizing control over water – a resource vital to millions of lives and livelihoods – China can hold another country hostage without firing a single shot.
In a water-stressed Asia, taming China’s hegemonic ambition is now the biggest strategic challenge.
A ‘China First’ Strategy for North Korea
LONDON – Most pundits agree that the least bad way to deal with North Korea’s nuclear saber rattling is a continued combination of tight containment and aggressive diplomacy.
Fewer, however, have recognized that the least bad military option – the one implied by US President Donald Trump’s insistence that China take responsibility for its dangerous neighbor – is a Chinese invasion, or regime change forced through China’s threat to launch one.
This outcome, which would sharply shift East Asia’s strategic balance in China’s favor, is not as unlikely as most people think.
In fact, its very plausibility is one reason why it needs to be taken seriously, including by Chinese military planners.
In Trumpian terms, this is a “China First” option that could help “Make China Great Again.”
Any military intervention, Chinese or otherwise, would carry huge risks.
But before dwelling on them, consider what a successful Chinese intervention would achieve.
For starters, it would put North Korea right where the country’s post-Korean War history suggests it belongs: under a Chinese nuclear umbrella, benefiting from a credible security guarantee.
Mao Zedong used to say that his country and North Korea were “as close as lips and teeth” – a fitting description, given Chinese troops’ role in averting an American victory in the Korean War.
But while Japan and South Korea have remained close allies of the United States during the six decades since then, hosting US bases and sheltering under US nuclear protection, China and North Korea have drifted ever further apart.
As a result, China has little control over its neighbor and purported ally, and probably scant knowledge of what is going on there.
It could, it is true, tighten the existing siege on North Korea by cutting trade further and blocking energy supplies.
But this might achieve little beyond pushing Kim Jong-un’s cloistered regime to look for support from its other neighbor, Russia.
If, as is commonly assumed, North Korea wants some sort of credible security guarantee in exchange for curtailing its nuclear program, the only country capable of providing it is China.
No American promise would remain credible beyond the term of the president who gave it, if even that long.
So if China were to combine threats of invasion with a promise of security and nuclear protection, in exchange for cooperation and possible regime change, its chances of winning over large parts of the Korean People’s Army would be high.
Whereas a nuclear exchange with the US would mean devastation, submission to China would promise survival, and presumably a degree of continued autonomy.
For all except those closest to Kim, the choice would not be a difficult one.
China’s strategic gains from a successful military intervention would include not only control of what happens on the Korean Peninsula, where it presumably would be able to establish military bases, but also regional gratitude for having prevented a catastrophic war.
No other action holds as much potential to make Chinese leadership within Asia seem both credible, and desirable, especially if the alternative is a reckless, poorly planned US-led war.
What China needs, above all, is legitimacy, and intervention in North Korea would provide it.
Successful use of hard power would bring China, to borrow the distinction coined by Harvard’s Joseph S. Nye, huge reserves of soft power.
But now to the 64 billion renminbi question: Could it work?
We can’t know the answer for sure, and any military intervention carries great risks.
The Chinese armed forces are now well equipped, but lack comparable battlefield experience.
Their inferior opponents have leaders who might be prepared to use nuclear weapons or other weapons of mass destruction, if they did not simply accept Chinese terms and surrender.
What we can say with near certainty is that a Chinese land and sea invasion, rather than an American one, would stand a better chance of avoiding Kim’s likely response: an artillery attack on the South Korean capital, Seoul, which lies just a few dozen miles south of the demilitarized zone.
Why would North Korea slaughter its southern brothers and sisters in retaliation for a Chinese invasion that came with a promise of continued security, if not autonomy?
Moreover, while the Kim regime’s nuclear restraint could hardly be taken for granted, China would be a less likely target than the US for North Korean missiles.
Were a Chinese military option to be contemplated seriously, some intelligence and missile-defense collaboration with the US might be worth exploring.
Given the risks, it would be hard for the US to refuse.
This scenario may well never happen.
But it is so logical that the possibility of it should be taken seriously.
It is, after all, China’s best opportunity to achieve greater strategic parity with the US in the region, while removing a source of instability that threatens them both.
China’s Debt-Trap Diplomacy
NEW DELHI – If there is one thing at which China’s leaders truly excel, it is the use of economic tools to advance their country’s geostrategic interests.
Through its $1 trillion “one belt, one road” initiative, China is supporting infrastructure projects in strategically located developing countries, often by extending huge loans to their governments.
As a result, countries are becoming ensnared in a debt trap that leaves them vulnerable to China’s influence.
Of course, extending loans for infrastructure projects is not inherently bad.
But the projects that China is supporting are often intended not to support the local economy, but to facilitate Chinese access to natural resources, or to open the market for its low-cost and shoddy export goods.
In many cases, China even sends its own construction workers, minimizing the number of local jobs that are created.
Several of the projects that have been completed are now bleeding money.
For example, Sri Lanka’s Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport, which opened in 2013 near Hambantota, has been dubbed the world’s emptiest.
Likewise, Hambantota’s Magampura Mahinda Rajapaksa Port remains largely idle, as does the multibillion-dollar Gwadar port in Pakistan.
For China, however, these projects are operating exactly as needed: Chinese attack submarines have twice docked at Sri Lankan ports, and two Chinese warships were recently pressed into service for Gwadar port security.
In a sense, it is even better for China that the projects don’t do well.
After all, the heavier the debt burden on smaller countries, the greater China’s own leverage becomes.
Already, China has used its clout to push Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, and Thailand to block a united ASEAN stand against China’s aggressive pursuit of its territorial claims in the South China Sea.
Moreover, some countries, overwhelmed by their debts to China, are being forced to sell to it stakes in Chinese-financed projects or hand over their management to Chinese state-owned firms.
In financially risky countries, China now demands majority ownership up front.
For example, China clinched a deal with Nepal this month to build another largely Chinese-owned dam there, with its state-run China Three Gorges Corporation taking a 75% stake.
As if that were not enough, China is taking steps to ensure that countries will not be able to escape their debts.
In exchange for rescheduling repayment, China is requiring countries to award it contracts for additional projects, thereby making their debt crises interminable.
Last October, China canceled $90 million of Cambodia’s debt, only to secure major new contracts.
Some developing economies are regretting their decision to accept Chinese loans.
Protests have erupted over widespread joblessness, purportedly caused by Chinese dumping of goods, which is killing off local manufacturing, and exacerbated by China’s import of workers for its own projects.
New governments in several countries, from Nigeria to Sri Lanka, have ordered investigations into alleged Chinese bribery of the previous leadership.
Last month, China’s acting ambassador to Pakistan, Zhao Lijian, was involved in a Twitter spat with Pakistani journalists over accusations of project-related corruption and the use of Chinese convicts as laborers in Pakistan (not a new practice for China).
Zhao described the accusations as “nonsense.”
In retrospect, China’s designs might seem obvious.
But the decision by many developing countries to accept Chinese loans was, in many ways, understandable.
Neglected by institutional investors, they had major unmet infrastructure needs.
So when China showed up, promising benevolent investment and easy credit, they were all in.
It became clear only later that China’s real objectives were commercial penetration and strategic leverage; by then, it was too late, and countries were trapped in a vicious cycle.
Sri Lanka is Exhibit A. Though small, the country is strategically located between China’s eastern ports and the Mediterranean.
Chinese President Xi Jinping has called it vital to the completion of the maritime Silk Road.
China began investing heavily in Sri Lanka during the quasi-autocratic nine-year rule of President Mahinda Rajapaksa, and China shielded Rajapaksa at the United Nations from allegations of war crimes.
China quickly became Sri Lanka’s leading investor and lender, and its second-largest trading partner, giving it substantial diplomatic leverage.
It was smooth sailing for China, until Rajapaksa was unexpectedly defeated in the early 2015 election by Maithripala Sirisena, who had campaigned on the promise to extricate Sri Lanka from the Chinese debt trap.
True to his word, he suspended work on major Chinese projects.
But it was too late: Sri Lanka’s government was already on the brink of default.
So, as a Chinese state mouthpiece crowed, Sri Lanka had no choice but “to turn around and embrace China again.”
Sirisena, in need of more time to repay old loans, as well as fresh credit, acquiesced to a series of Chinese demands, restarting suspended initiatives, like the $1.4 billion Colombo Port City, and awarding China new projects.
Sirisena also recently agreed to sell an 80% stake in the Hambantota port to China for about $1.1 billion.
According to China’s ambassador to Sri Lanka, Yi Xianliang, the sale of stakes in other projects is also under discussion, in order to help Sri Lanka “solve its finance problems.”
Now, Rajapaksa is accusing Sirisena of granting China undue concessions.
By integrating its foreign, economic, and security policies, China is advancing its goal of fashioning a hegemonic sphere of trade, communication, transportation, and security links.
If states are saddled with onerous levels of debt as a result, their financial woes only aid China’s neocolonial designs.
Countries that are not yet ensnared in China’s debt trap should take note – and take whatever steps they can to avoid it.
Taking the Politics Out of Development
LONDON – Later this month, Chinese President Xi Jinping will host a summit for many of the leaders of the 65 countries engaged in his “one belt, one road” (OBOR) initiative, a pioneering program that will channel billions of investment dollars toward infrastructure projects across Asia, Africa, and Europe.
Despite a strong economic case for the project, reactions have been mixed.
The main impulse driving the OBOR initiative is physical connectivity: efficient infrastructure enhances productivity, fosters investment, and lowers the costs of trade.
With effective channels for the exchange of goods and well-connected information networks, growth accelerates, economic opportunity increases, and inequality narrows.
The good news is that such infrastructure can be built in an efficient and cost-effective manner.
The key is cooperative efforts that exploit each country’s respective comparative advantage, be it capital, technological know-how, logistical or construction capabilities, raw materials, or even industrial goods.
Such an approach can jumpstart development in low-income countries, and help emerging economies bypass the dreaded middle-income trap.
But making physical connectivity work requires not only massive amounts of funding; policy coordination and regulatory harmonization are necessary as well.
In the short term, infrastructure investment can be impeded by significant political, sovereign, and financial risks.
For starters, there is the risk that political leaders will prioritize short-term interests above a long-term vision.
For example, they may try to win votes with reductions in road tolls or water tariffs, causing otherwise good infrastructure projects to produce net losses.
They may also lack motivation to raise funds for big projects, unless those efforts would translate into actual votes.
It does not help that many countries are also grappling with public debt, which makes it difficult for them to borrow from multilateral development institutions.
With limited fiscal space, governments might need to resort to levying taxes – a politically difficult solution – to pursue infrastructure investment. They might also have to reduce investment in other critical areas, like education, health, or environmental protection.
Private investors, for their part, may be neither willing nor able to hold illiquid assets for the entire gestation and construction process.
That process is long in the best of times; in developing countries with weak institutional capabilities, it is often drawn out substantially, creating massive additional costs.
Many national authorities are attempting to address this by improving governance and providing an enabling environment for infrastructure investment, including by promoting public-private partnerships.
But successes have been far and few between.
China sees all of this.
It recognizes the urgency with which developing countries need investments in roads, railroads, power plants and grids, airports, and seaports, as well as the challenges they face in securing them.
And it is well aware of the potential benefits of connectivity, particularly if it extends beyond the Asia-Pacific region.
Since introducing the OBOR initiative, China has often been accused of attempting to wrest greater control over the developing world, and even to replace the United States as the dominant global superpower.
Some, pointing to the historical record, warn of the “Thucydides Trap”: a rising power will eventually try to challenge an established one.
But such warnings overlook a crucial lesson of that record: the challenges almost always end badly.
China is well aware of how the Thucydides Trap has ensnared both the dominant power and the challenger, even after the challenger might seem to have won.
This has not, however, stopped politicians from stoking fears about China and the OBOR initiative.
Sri Lanka is a case in point.
Until recently, it had welcomed – and even sought – infrastructure investment from China.
When politicians began to attempt to win support by sowing doubts about China’s intentions, however, the prevailing mood vis-à-vis China turned from appreciation to indignation.
Those politicians then accepted financial support from the US and India, but that money never came.
Today, Sri Lanka’s government has little choice but to rekindle its relationship with China.
Fortunately for Sri Lanka – and other OBOR participants – China’s intentions are far from malicious.
Its real goal is to lead an inclusive and cooperative integration process that benefits all participants.
And, in fact, China may well be the best-equipped country for the job.
In the US, a major infrastructure upgrade is long overdue, with politics, among other factors, impeding progress.
By contrast, China has, in the words of Jeffrey D. Sachs, “proved itself highly effective at building large and complex infrastructure” that “complements industrial capital” and has “attracted foreign private-sector capital and technology.”
Of course, China may be accused of advancing its own agenda for any action that it takes abroad.
And, to some extent, such accusations would be true, just as they are whenever a global power intervenes abroad, whatever the motivation.
The US-led Marshall Plan was aimed not just at supporting the reconstruction of Western Europe after World War II, but also at reviving markets for US exports and containing the Soviet Union.
This is not to say that China could not have done anything better in pursuing the OBOR initiative.
On the contrary, it could have been more effective in making the economic case for physical connectivity.
And Chinese companies could have taken more care to understand and appreciate local customs and cultures, thereby avoiding unnecessary tensions with local people, as well as to ensure environmental sustainability.
But these lapses are fixable – and are being addressed, both by Xi’s administration and Chinese companies investing overseas.
The bigger challenge lies in creating a designated institution to coordinate the many OBOR initiatives. On this front, success will be possible only if countries avoid allowing politics to cloud their judgment.
There is no defense for rejecting an economically sensible global initiative just because China is the one leading it.
What Does Xi Jinping Want?
BEIJING – Most Western media have characterized the recent 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC) as a pure power play, with President Xi Jinping entrenching his position.
But the accumulation of political capital in this case is a means to an end.
For Xi, that end is a smooth transition into modernity that cements the CPC’s long-term authority and ensures his own legacy as modern China’s most significant leader.
Xi knows that if China is to continue to thrive in a fast-changing world, he will need to manage deftly a major social and economic transformation, while, even more important, improving state governance.
And, in order to secure the long-term survival of China’s one-party system, he must reform state and Party institutions; indeed, political reform is, for Xi, a prerequisite for economic reform.
(And yet, he will carefully avoid what he considers the mistakes of the last Soviet president, Mikhail Gorbachev.)
Xi’s motive in pursuing modernity is not, as many in the West have wrongly inferred, to establish China as a superpower on par with the United States; on the contrary, Xi views his current challenge and mission as being primarily domestic.
He is motivated by the knowledge that success in this area will define his place in history. That, not the amount of authority he wields today, is his primary concern.
Assuming otherwise sells Xi – and his political ingenuity – short.
Now firmly established as China’s most powerful leader since Deng Xiaoping, Xi can shape his legacy according to his own vision.
Because his predecessor Hu Jintao lacked sufficient political capital to do likewise, China followed a largely passive path for a decade, pursuing conciliatory diplomacy (which enraged its citizens) and economically conservative strategies (which included suspending necessary reforms).
No one, however, should mistake Xi’s enhanced powers for a personal dictatorship.
His choice of members for the Standing Committee of the Politburo, China’s highest authority, was an accommodation to the reality that there are limits to his power. Only half of the men named to the committee were his true confidantes.
The legacy that Xi seeks comprises three key components.
The first is alleviation of growing social tensions.
Beyond improving the provision of public goods, his promotion of the so-called China Dream of national rejuvenation has been aimed, in part, at encouraging people to seek fulfillment beyond material wealth.
Second, Xi wants to strengthen the CPC, not by force, but by reform.
Over the last five years, Xi has led an unprecedented anti-corruption campaign, which has brought down one million Party officials, from low-ranking bureaucrats (known as “flies”) to the highest-level officials (“tigers”), throughout the country.
Such a large-scale campaign, as some observers have portrayed it, was not a political purge in disguise.
Rather, Xi knew that widespread corruption was undermining the CPC’s legitimacy in the eyes of ordinary Chinese.
Only by cleaning up the Party’s behavior could Xi reestablish its credibility.
Now, Xi is ready for Act II of his CPC revival: improving state governance.
Xi is well aware that a case-by-case approach will not address the root causes of widespread corruption.
For that, the entire system needs an overhaul.
As he put it, “The Party needs to govern itself.”
The first step is to improve the legislative framework.
For many years, the lack of accountability and transparency, and of clear decision-making processes, has impeded reform.
Now, China needs institutionalized mechanisms for enforcing the rule of law – one aspect of Western political systems that Xi admires – among CPC officials, though the idea that the judiciary could be independent of the Party remains farfetched.
But even the best-designed system cannot work if there is a dearth of competent personnel to run it – a limitation highlighted by Xi’s push for economic reforms in his first term as president.
That is why Xi is placing a strong emphasis on cultivating a new generation of highly educated, loyal, and, most important, incorruptible Party leaders.
A key challenge here lies in stemming the migration of China’s top talent to the private sector.
The third component of Xi’s legacy is also the most important – and already effectively secured.
At the 19th National Congress, CCP delegates agreed to add “Xi Jinping Thought” to the Party’s constitution, alongside “Mao Zedong Thought” and “Deng Xiaoping Theory.”
Now that Xi’s eponymous political ideology, which proposes an alternative to liberal democracy, is part of the school of thought around which the CPC coalesces, challenging Xi is tantamount to challenging the Party’s very belief system.
In short, Xi has made himself virtually unassailable – his rare political skill elevating him to the status of secular deity.
The fact is that, as a leader, Xi has a lot going for him.
He is well-educated and experienced in international affairs.
He has weathered serious challenges and experienced firsthand the consequences of political and economic policies gone awry.
He has a vast political network, thanks not only to his own deftness, but also to his family: he is the son of a comrade of Mao.
And he now stands alongside Mao, as well as Deng, in modern China’s political pantheon.
But Xi is not Mao, and he will not govern China as Mao did.
Instead, he will learn from Mao’s mistakes, so that he can lead China effectively into the next phase of its history – and secure the legacy that he so prizes.
Has China’s Economic Growth Finally Stabilized?
BEIJING – For the last decade or so, China’s economy has been on something of a roller coaster ride.
As 2018 begins, is the country approaching a new ascent, a steep drop, or something in between?
Prior to the global economic crisis a decade ago, the Chinese economy was growing at a breakneck pace.
But when the crisis hit, the growth rate fell relatively sharply.
Thanks to a $4 trillion stimulus package, growth soon reached its trough and began to climb again, reaching 12.2% year on year in the first quarter of 2010.
Soon after, however, monetary tightening put economic growth back on a downward trajectory, spurring the government to loosen policy and introduce mini-stimulus packages in late 2011 and early 2012.
This produced a short-lived and moderate rebound, with economic growth again beginning to slide, albeit less steeply, soon after.
Finally, in 2016, Chinese economic growth began to stabilize again, with the annual rate reaching 6.7% for three quarters in a row.
The latest figures show that China’s economy grew by 6.8% in the third quarter of 2017, leading many economists to offer rather optimistic forecasts for the coming year.
Though China’s financial system is fraught with worrying vulnerabilities, many Chinese economists believe that the country has at last entered a period of stable annual growth of about 6.5% – a level that is in line with potential.
The International Monetary Fund has echoed this view in its latest World Economic Outlook, predicting 6.8% growth in 2017 and a 6.5% rate in 2018.
I am less sanguine.
For decades, fixed-asset investment was the main driver of growth, accounting for almost half of total demand.
Its share of China’s GDP today exceeds 50%, while investment calculated as residual capital formation accounts for some 45% of GDP.
Yet, since late 2013, investment growth has been declining steadily, a trend that accelerated in the second half of 2017.
In the first three quarters of 2017, fixed-asset investment grew at an average rate of just 2.19% year on year.
In the third quarter, investment growth was actually negative, at -1.1%.
China has not seen such lows in decades.
From the perspective of structural adjustment, China’s declining dependence on fixed-asset investment should be hailed as an achievement.
But, as the Financial Times’ Martin Wolf emphasized in 2016, it will be very difficult for China to sustain aggregate demand amid weakening investment growth.
Household consumption is unlikely to pick up the slack.
In the first three quarters of 2017, private consumption grew by 5.9% in real (inflation-adjusted) terms – down 0.5 percentage points from 2016.
It is difficult to envisage a sudden surge in household consumption in 2018.
Growth in net exports, too, seems unlikely to offset declining investment, not least because US President Donald Trump continues to lean toward protectionism in his dealings with China.
And while China probably will continue to use fiscal policy to shore up demand, the extent to which it can do so will be constrained by factors like local governments’ debt burden and a consequent clampdown on so-called local-government financing vehicles.
The government probably will not allow the budget deficit to surpass 3% of GDP.
China’s fixed-asset investment comprises three main categories: manufacturing, infrastructure, and real estate.
Manufacturing investment accounts for the largest share – 30%.
But it has been declining steadily since 2012, weakening overall investment growth.
And it is unlikely to pick up again, unless China achieves some technological or institutional breakthrough.
Real-estate investment, meanwhile, has followed a cyclical pattern over the last two decades, recovering strongly in early 2016 before falling again in 2017.
Given the government’s determination to contain housing prices – which have, at various times, stoked concern about local bubbles – there is little reason to expect that real-estate investment will rebound anytime soon.
This leaves only infrastructure investment, whose share of total investment has been increasing since 2012.
But infrastructure investment has already reached such a high level that continued growth could worsen resource allocation – the opposite of the government’s stated objectives.
Add to that fiscal constraints and stricter financial regulation, and a further expansion of infrastructure investment would be difficult, to say the least.
All of this leads to a simple conclusion: unless I’ve read the official investment statistics wrong, optimism about China’s economic growth in 2018 is not warranted.
But this does not mean that China’s prospects are altogether dismal.
If economic growth seems to be falling far below the 6.5% target, the government will employ macroeconomic stabilization tools, despite the high heavy future costs, while working to prevent financial vulnerabilities from turning into systemic financial risks.
More promising, the Chinese government’s ongoing efforts to cultivate innovation and implement structural reforms are likely to produce major returns in the long term.
All of this suggests that China’s economic roller coaster is headed for another climb, and that growth will eventually stabilize at a decent rate.
But, as with most popular attractions, its passengers may have to wait a while.
Why the Renminbi Won’t Rule
TOKYO – In the dystopian fantasy Blade Runner 2049, Los Angeles 32 years from now looks a lot like China’s megacities today: grey, polluted, and dominated by tall towers emblazoned with flashing neon advertisements.
The viewer never learns much about the outside world, much less in what currency the advertised goods are traded.
Is the US dollar still dominant, has the Chinese renminbi taken over, or has some other currency surged to global preeminence?
US President Donald Trump seems intent on ensuring that America retreats, at least partly, from its global leadership role.
But, as was the case with the British pound in the interwar period, a currency can remain globally dominant even after its issuing country loses its economic, financial, and geopolitical hegemony.
Today, too, the world should expect the US dollar to remain the key reserve currency, used to invoice and settle international trade, for a long time to come.
But, in terms of international financial diplomacy, the dollar’s position may not be as secure.
The question is whether the end of “dollar diplomacy,” which the economist Barry Eichengreen predicts, will necessarily mean the rise of renminbi diplomacy.
Chinese policymakers have been hoping to develop the renminbi’s role in international finance, in order to strengthen China’s geopolitical standing, since the 1990s.
And, in recent years, the Chinese leadership has led a concerted effort to fulfill that ambition, especially by internationalizing China’s currency.
Yet renminbi-denominated finance is nowhere near ready to compete with – let alone rival – dollar finance.
In fact, the renminbi still trails other reserve currencies (the US dollar, the euro, the Japanese yen, and the British pound) in international finance by so much that a renminbi-led international monetary system by mid-century seems about as likely as a Blade Runner 2049-style dystopia.
One reason for the renminbi’s continued weakness in international finance is that, despite considerable progress since 2010, it remains a half-baked international currency.
The renminbi is illiquid and unconvertible outside designated offshore markets.
As a result, its weight in international investors’ portfolios is miniscule.
Even China itself uses the renminbi in only about a quarter of its international trade, and its international finance remains dollar-denominated.
China’s blue-chip firms – Alibaba, Baidu, and Tencent – are listed in New York or Hong Kong, where they are priced either in US or Hong Kong dollars.
And most of China’s fast-expanding loans and overseas investments are in dollars.
But the most compelling reason why one should not expect a renminbi-dominated international finance system to arise anytime soon is that China’s leaders have never shown any sustained commitment to developing the renminbi as a true alternative to the dollar.
Instead, they have pursued a cooperative approach to reform of the international monetary system, which they argue should not be dependent on any one currency.
For the Chinese, the future of the international monetary system should be one in which multiple national currencies provide choice – in terms of invoicing, payments, and asset allocation – thereby reducing the system’s exposure to national politics.
Moreover, with more central banks creating liquidity, and international financial centers offering pools of it, such a system would entail a lower risk of cash crunches.
Already, China has been experimenting with the development of offshore renminbi markets in key financial centers, as a way to overcome its currency’s limited liquidity.
In order to build such a multi-currency system, however, the world would need to undertake far-reaching reforms of the international institutions.
This was precisely the point that Zhou Xiaochuan, the governor of the People’s Bank of China, made in a 2009 speech challenging the view that only the US, through the dollar, could guarantee the functioning of the international monetary system.
As Zhou pointed out, the US dollar’s monetary dominance is underpinned by the Bretton Woods institutions, created after World War II.
Reforming the international monetary system, therefore, means reforming the governance of the multilateral financial institutions – an argument that China emphasized during its G20 presidency last year.
As the US retreats from the world stage and a multipolar global order emerges, the international monetary system may well be transformed – but probably not into a renminbi-led system.
Whether because of the intrinsic weakness of China’s international finance or an understanding that a truly international currency must be more market-driven than the government-controlled renminbi could be, not even China expects the age of renminbi diplomacy to arrive anytime soon.
China’s Soft and Sharp Power
CAMBRIDGE – China has invested billions of dollars to increase its soft power, but it has recently suffered a backlash in democratic countries.
A new report by the National Endowment for Democracy argues that we need to re-think soft power, because “the conceptual vocabulary that has been used since the Cold War’s end no longer seems adequate to the contemporary situation.”
The report describes the new authoritarian influences being felt around the world as “sharp power.”
A recent cover article in The Economist defines “sharp power” by its reliance on “subversion, bullying and pressure, which combine to promote self-censorship.”
Whereas soft power harnesses the allure of culture and values to augment a country’s strength, sharp power helps authoritarian regimes compel behavior at home and manipulate opinion abroad.
The term “soft power” – the ability to affect others by attraction and persuasion rather than the hard power of coercion and payment – is sometimes used to describe any exercise of power that does not involve the use of force.
But that is a mistake. Power sometimes depends on whose army or economy wins, but it can also depend on whose story wins.
A strong narrative is a source of power.
China’s economic success has generated both hard and soft power, but within limits.
A Chinese economic aid package under the Belt and Road Initiative may appear benign and attractive, but not if the terms turn sour, as was recently the case in a Sri Lankan port project.
Likewise, other exercises of economic hard power undercut the soft power of China’s narrative.
For example, China punished Norway for awarding a Nobel Peace Prize to Liu Xiaobo. It also threatened to restrict access to the Chinese market for an Australian publisher of a book critical of China.
If we use the term sharp power as shorthand for information warfare, the contrast with soft power becomes plain.
Sharp power is a type of hard power.
It manipulates information, which is intangible, but intangibility is not the distinguishing characteristic of soft power.
Verbal threats, for example, are both intangible and coercive.
When I introduced the concept of soft power in 1990, I wrote that it is characterized by voluntarism and indirection, while hard power rests on threats and inducements.
If someone aims a gun at you, demands your money, and takes your wallet, what you think and want is irrelevant. That is hard power.
If he persuades you to give him your money, he has changed what you think and want. That is soft power.
Truth and openness create a dividing line between soft and sharp power in public diplomacy.
When China’s official news agency, Xinhua, broadcasts openly in other countries, it is employing soft-power techniques, and we should accept that.
When China Radio International covertly backs 33 radio stations in 14 countries, the boundary of sharp power has been crossed, and we should expose the breach of voluntarism.
Of course, advertising and persuasion always involve some degree of framing, which limits voluntarism, as do structural features of the social environment.
But extreme deception in framing can be viewed as coercive; though not violent, it prevents meaningful choice.
Techniques of public diplomacy that are widely viewed as propaganda cannot produce soft power.
In an age of information, the scarcest resources are attention and credibility.
That is why exchange programs that develop two-way communication and personal relations among students and young leaders are often far more effective generators of soft power than, say, official broadcasting.
The United States has long had programs enabling visits by young foreign leaders, and now China is successfully following suit.
That is a smart exercise of soft power.
But when visas are manipulated or access is limited to restrain criticism and encourage self-censorship, even such exchange programs can shade into sharp power.
As democracies respond to China’s sharp power and information warfare, they have to be careful not to overreact.
Much of the soft power democracies wield comes from civil society, which means that openness is a crucial asset.
China could generate more soft power if it would relax some of its tight party control over civil society.
Similarly, manipulation of media and reliance on covert channels of communication often reduces soft power.
Democracies should avoid the temptation to imitate these authoritarian sharp-power tools.
Moreover, shutting down legitimate Chinese soft-power tools can be counter-productive.
Soft power is often used for competitive, zero-sum purposes; but it can also have positive sum aspects.
For example, if both China and the US wish to avoid conflict, exchange programs that increase American attraction to China, and vice versa, would benefit both countries.
And on transnational issues such as climate change, where both countries can benefit from cooperation, soft power can help build the trust and create the networks that make such cooperation possible.
While it would be a mistake to prohibit Chinese soft-power efforts just because they sometimes shade into sharp power, it is also important to monitor the dividing line carefully.
For example, the Hanban, the government agency that manages the 500 Confucius Institutes and 1,000 Confucius classrooms that China supports in universities and schools around the world to teach Chinese language and culture, must resist the temptation to set restrictions that limit academic freedom. Crossing that line has led to the disbanding of some Confucius Institutes.
As such cases show, the best defense against China’s use of soft-power programs as sharp-power tools is open exposure of such efforts. And this is where democracies have an advantage.
China’s Creditor Imperialism
BERLIN – This month, Sri Lanka, unable to pay the onerous debt to China it has accumulated, formally handed over its strategically located Hambantota port to the Asian giant.
It was a major acquisition for China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) – which President Xi Jinping calls the “project of the century” – and proof of just how effective China’s debt-trap diplomacy can be.
Unlike International Monetary Fund and World Bank lending, Chinese loans are collateralized by strategically important natural assets with high long-term value (even if they lack short-term commercial viability).
Hambantota, for example, straddles Indian Ocean trade routes linking Europe, Africa, and the Middle East to Asia.
In exchange for financing and building the infrastructure that poorer countries need, China demands favorable access to their natural assets, from mineral resources to ports.
Moreover, as Sri Lanka’s experience starkly illustrates, Chinese financing can shackle its “partner” countries.
Rather than offering grants or concessionary loans, China provides huge project-related loans at market-based rates, without transparency, much less environmental- or social-impact assessments.
As US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson put it recently, with the BRI, China is aiming to define “its own rules and norms.”
To strengthen its position further, China has encouraged its companies to bid for outright purchase of strategic ports, where possible.
The Mediterranean port of Piraeus, which a Chinese firm acquired for $436 million from cash-strapped Greece last year, will serve as the BRI’s “dragon head” in Europe.
By wielding its financial clout in this manner, China seeks to kill two birds with one stone.
First, it wants to address overcapacity at home by boosting exports.
And, second, it hopes to advance its strategic interests, including expanding its diplomatic influence, securing natural resources, promoting the international use of its currency, and gaining a relative advantage over other powers.
China’s predatory approach – and its gloating over securing Hambantota – is ironic, to say the least.
In its relationships with smaller countries like Sri Lanka, China is replicating the practices used against it in the European-colonial period, which began with the 1839-1860 Opium Wars and ended with the 1949 communist takeover – a period that China bitterly refers to as its “century of humiliation.”
China portrayed the 1997 restoration of its sovereignty over Hong Kong, following more than a century of British administration, as righting a historic injustice.
Yet, as Hambantota shows, China is now establishing its own Hong Kong-style neocolonial arrangements.
Apparently Xi’s promise of the “great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation” is inextricable from the erosion of smaller states’ sovereignty.
Just as European imperial powers employed gunboat diplomacy to open new markets and colonial outposts, China uses sovereign debt to bend other states to its will, without having to fire a single shot.
Like the opium the British exported to China, the easy loans China offers are addictive.
And, because China chooses its projects according to their long-term strategic value, they may yield short-term returns that are insufficient for countries to repay their debts.
This gives China added leverage, which it can use, say, to force borrowers to swap debt for equity, thereby expanding China’s global footprint by trapping a growing number of countries in debt servitude.
Even the terms of the 99-year Hambantota port lease echo those used to force China to lease its own ports to Western colonial powers.
Britain leased the New Territories from China for 99 years in 1898, causing Hong Kong’s landmass to expand by 90%.
Yet the 99-year term was fixed merely to help China’s ethnic-Manchu Qing Dynasty save face; the reality was that all acquisitions were believed to be permanent.
Now, China is applying the imperial 99-year lease concept in distant lands.
China’s lease agreement over Hambantota, concluded this summer, included a promise that China would shave $1.1 billion off Sri Lanka’s debt.
In 2015, a Chinese firm took out a 99-year lease on Australia’s deep-water port of Darwin – home to more than 1,000 US Marines – for $388 million.
Similarly, after lending billions of dollars to heavily indebted Djibouti, China established its first overseas military base this year in that tiny but strategic state, just a few miles from a US naval base – the only permanent American military facility in Africa.
Trapped in a debt crisis, Djibouti had no choice but to lease land to China for $20 million per year.
China has also used its leverage over Turkmenistan to secure natural gas by pipeline largely on Chinese terms.
Several other countries, from Argentina to Namibia to Laos, have been ensnared in a Chinese debt trap, forcing them to confront agonizing choices in order to stave off default.
Kenya’s crushing debt to China now threatens to turn its busy port of Mombasa – the gateway to East Africa – into another Hambantota.
These experiences should serve as a warning that the BRI is essentially an imperial project that aims to bring to fruition the mythical Middle Kingdom.
States caught in debt bondage to China risk losing both their most valuable natural assets and their very sovereignty.
The new imperial giant’s velvet glove cloaks an iron fist – one with the strength to squeeze the vitality out of smaller countries.
China’s State-Owned Enterprises at a Crossroads
HONG KONG – China has lately been facing harsh criticism for the direction of its reforms of state-owned enterprises, particularly its strengthening of the role of Communist Party committees in SOE management.
But while this might seem like a step backward for China’s market-oriented reforms, there are good reasons to boost oversight, at least for now.
With China undergoing a fundamental transformation into an innovation-driven, knowledge-based, and services-led economy, its leaders must think carefully about how to reform the SOEs so that they can contribute to the new economy.
In the past, the role of the SOEs was clear.
Over the last three decades, they underpinned China’s emergence as a global manufacturing powerhouse, by spearheading China’s infrastructure-construction boom.
In the process, they became dominant, especially in sectors prone to natural monopolies (such as telecommunications and power) and key strategic sectors (such as steel, coal, and banking).
But the traditional single-sided markets where SOEs lead are now being disrupted by new technology firms like Alibaba and Tencent, which straddle multi-sided markets of production, logistics, and distribution by using unified platforms that benefit from economies of scale.
By creating platforms for consumers and small-scale producers – what is essentially public infrastructure – these firms have directly challenged the SOE business model.
New digital platforms respond quickly and efficiently to public needs.
These businesses are more collaborative or sharing than the traditional business of manufacturing, allowing consumers and smaller start-ups to shape products and services, from design to distribution.
Given China’s population of 1.3 billion – a major competitive advantage in terms of innovation and purchasing power – these platforms can disrupt the incumbent one-sided market producers by offering superior scale, speed, and convenience, including access to global markets.
Meanwhile, the SOEs’ obsolete business model – not to mention strong inertia – makes it difficult to identify and respond to new opportunities in providing public goods in a changing economy.
China’s state-owned telecommunication companies and banks, for example, have failed to respond to new technological challenges.
Even traditional private companies like Huawei and Midea have done much better, adjusting to shifting consumer demand and changing factor costs by retooling as quickly as possible, acquiring, for example, robot technology and product designs from the West.
Such responsiveness is particularly critical today, when the inexorable logic of technological progress is demanding a transformation of China’s growth model.
With demand for consumer hardware and durables falling, China must begin to develop its own higher-tech products, while building a strong services sector.
And with world exports of goods declining – both cyclically and as a result of the growth slowdown in the advanced economies – China must activate its domestic consumer base.
But the inability to update the roles and business models of SOEs is holding China back in this regard.
SOEs may enjoy privileged access to bank credit, natural resources, and land, but they also suffer from rigid governance and high staff turnover, spurred by President Xi Jinping’s anti-corruption campaign.
When it comes to key personnel, the Communist Party establishment calls the shots.
So, for SOEs to make changes, there must be consensus among internal and external officials in charge of business, industrial policy, and politics.
In the late 1990s, public listings of SOEs had the twin benefits of securing new resources for tackling legacy losses and propelling governance and productivity gains.
Today, however, privately owned technology platforms, many of which are listed abroad, have captured much of the valuation gains of the new economy.
As a result, policymakers are struggling to find a way to finance the creative destruction of outdated SOEs burdened by debt, excess capacity, and obsolete equipment.
It is this uncertainty that seems to have spurred the authorities to rethink their original, more aggressive reform plan.
They recognize that, when economic and financial systems comprise intricate networks of a variety of interlocking and interdependent elements, changes to one component – especially one as dominant as China’s state sector – can have far-reaching consequences.
With the recent adjustments to the reform strategy, China’s leaders have bought themselves some time to figure out where the SOEs can fit into the new economy.
The answer probably lies in new public infrastructure challenges – the kind that the advanced economies are already facing – including issues related to information security and competition.
If SOEs shift their business models to provide platform and regulatory services at low cost, taking advantage of economies of scale, they can help, for example, to manage the use of information by the large private platforms.
Or they might help to guide the entry of foreign tech giants like Facebook and Google into the Chinese market, to ensure that those companies do not become too dominant.
State-owned banks, for their part, might be able to provide multi-tiered financing for the millions of small and medium-size enterprises that are eager to shape and enrich the new economy.
Finally, SOEs can enter into public-private partnerships with local businesses to handle the construction and management of transport and traffic systems, urban drainage, and bodies responsible for food safety, pollution control, and public security.
The good news is that the Chinese government, at both the national and local levels, has plenty of assets with real value, amounting to more than 140% of GDP.
Those assets can help to smooth the transition to this new SOE business model, such as by plugging the holes in the social security system and addressing legacy liabilities, including those arising from past corruption, non-performing loans, and inadequate provision of public goods and services.
China’s SOEs are at a crossroads.
Given the high stakes of reform, the country’s leaders are right to take some time to assess their options.
Whichever route they take is sure to be challenging.
But those challenges pale in comparison to the problems that would arise from sticking to the old SOE model.
The Contradictions of China’s Communist Capitalism
BERKELEY – The recent dizzying plunge in the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges has posed a unique test for China’s Communist rulers.
So long as the markets were rising, the paradox of vigorous capitalist development overseen by the world’s largest and strongest Communist party confounded only academics and old-school Marxists.
As the Chinese Communist Party elite and their relatives, foreign financial institutions, and some Chinese small investors (enabled by margin lending) made money on stocks, no one bothered to comprehend the mutant creature they were milking.
But now, as the realization sinks in that Chinese stock prices will not keep rising indefinitely, the CCP is taking desperate, if clumsy, measures to control the correction.
All new initial public offerings have been halted, and much trading has been curtailed; the central bank has been asked to help the China Securities Finance Corporation induce investors to buy shares and thus stabilize the market.
Indeed, even the country’s sovereign wealth fund has gotten into the act.
But, unlike in other capitalist economies, money is not the only tool at the authorities’ disposal.
If your brokers in China advise you to sell shares, they must be careful not to appear to be rumormongers, subject to official punishment.
And there are reports that sales of large holdings may trigger investigations by the authorities.
Causing public disorder or financial instability can be a serious offense in China, where conspiracy theories about foreigners’ efforts to undermine the economy abound.
What Chinese officials desire is a capitalist stock market without the possibility of large losses that can shake confidence in the CCP’s credibility and control.
But that is a market that no one has yet invented.
The spectacle of a communist regime trying to jack up a casino-like capitalist market is just one of the many contradictions that have been accumulating in almost every corner of China’s economy and politics.
And now, their weight is perhaps becoming too heavy for the Party hierarchy to bear.
Indeed, the composition of the CCP is itself a contradiction.
The revolutionary party of peasants and workers is now dominated by businessmen, college students, and professionals.
One-third of the people listed in the Hurun Report, the Shanghai-based monitor of China’s wealthiest people, are Party members.
The average wealth of the richest 70 members of the National People’s Congress, China’s parliament, far exceeds $1 billion.
(The richest 70 members of India’s parliament or even the US Congress, both now controlled by right-wing political parties, are substantially less wealthy.)
Of course, President Xi Jinping’s recent drive against corruption high and low has made many Communist Party plutocrats jittery.
But questions abound as to whether the corruption charges being brought against the so-called “tigers” are a fig leaf for an old-fashioned purge of Xi’s rivals in the Party and the military.
Ordinary Chinese generally support the anti-corruption drive; it is they who usually initiate protests and point fingers at dishonest officials.
But, if such protests attract too much attention, it is more likely that they will be quashed and their leaders repressed than that the corruption will be stopped.
In 2008, for example, following the Sichuan earthquake, thousands of children died when their shoddily built schools collapsed.
For a while, tales of corruption in the schools’ construction dominated even the official news.
In the end, however, it was the protesting parents and teachers of the dead children who were detained and harassed by the state.
What the CCP refuses to recognize is that corruption cannot be rooted out as long as the Party maintains its monopoly on political power; with no organized opposition or functioning civil-society institutions, officials will continue to use their positions of public authority as a vehicle to generate personal wealth.
The Third Plenum of the 18th Party Congress gave primacy to the principle of market competition; but, as a senior Chinese banker commented in a related context some years back: “It’s quite hard to compete when you’re playing against the referee.”
That observation extends to the rule of law and constitutionalism.
Under Xi, the CCP has repeatedly insisted that the rule of law is a “core socialist value” and has pledged to promote the authority of the constitution.
Yet the rule of law in the Party’s eyes is a law that it dictates, interprets, and enforces.
Chinese citizens’ references to the constitution (especially article 35, which guarantees freedom of speech, press, assembly, and association) and constitutionalism in general are routinely censored, and lawyers who cite the constitution in court are frequently detained.
Mao famously speculated on the nature of contradictions in a 1937 essay: “The law of contradiction in things, that is, the law of the unity of opposites, is the fundamental law of nature and of society.”
One wonders, though, if even he could have grasped, much less managed, the contradictions of communist capitalism.
China’s Painful Structural Transformation
SHANGHAI – For more than a year, headlines worldwide have been pointing to a Chinese economic slowdown.
But a closer look at regional dynamics within China tells a different story – one that is less about deceleration than changing gears.
According to China’s National Bureau of Statistics, the resource-rich province of Shanxi has suffered an economic slowdown, but the southwestern provinces of Chongqing and Guizhou have experienced vibrant growth.
Hebei and three other northeastern provinces are feeling the effects of recession, but the heavy-industry economies of Tianjin, Shandong, and Jiangsu are booming.
After the 2008 financial crisis, when slower growth became the “new normal” for many countries, China began to accelerate its economic rebalancing by shifting the drivers of growth from manufacturing and exports toward goods and services for domestic consumption.
This transition has had far-reaching implications for the future dynamics of China’s economy.
With its previous export strategy, the government’s main priority was to integrate domestic manufacturing operations into global production chains.
Now, however, its aim is an economy that meets domestic consumers’ diverse demands, and it is the industries closely connected to those demands that are quickly expanding.
Previously, the economic activities that are now flourishing weren’t categorized as manufacturing industries at all, but as “services.” But services do not exist in a vacuum.
All businesses need manufactured products, transportation, information and communications technology (ICT), logistics, real estate, finance, insurance, and more.
Thus, new demand for new services has virtuous-cycle effects in terms of capital investment in infrastructure and equipment.
Contrary to the conventional wisdom, the growth of services in China to meet domestic demand does not mean the end of manufacturing and capital investment, much less of economic growth.
Service sectors stand to make up for much, if not all, of the growth lost to lower output in export-oriented manufacturing branches.
China’s transportation, ICT, finance, insurance, real estate, education, and health-care sectors have long had inappropriately low labor productivity, which means they have significant room to grow faster.
According to a paper by the economists Jong-Wha Lee and Warwick J. McKibbin, service-sector productivity growth in Asia “benefits all sectors eventually, and contributes to the sustained and balanced growth of Asian economies.”
Examining economic development trends in South Korea, the authors find that the average value added per worker in transportation, real estate, and ICT is now higher than the average in manufacturing, and they point to similar dynamics in the United States, Japan, and China.
This finding suggests that rapid development in China’s service economy could reverse the externally triggered dampening of growth since 2008.
But, as the Japanese and South Korean transitions from export to domestic demand-driven growth demonstrate, structural transformation is a slow and painful process.
China is in the midst of that process, and it must be careful not to undermine existing sources of growth lest it fall into a structural trap where the cost of transition itself derails new gains.
It is not a good sign that the high costs in many Chinese provinces have been weighing down overall growth.
This points to fundamental challenges ahead, notwithstanding the significant economic potential of Chinese consumers.
For starters, economic development based on diversified domestic demand is more complicated than export-driven development, because these new sectors rely more heavily on sophisticated financial services, free and equitable market access, better educated workers, and higher investment in research and development.
As a result, the new businesses emerging from the shift to a new growth model are demanding far more from China’s current economic-governance system than it can bear.
Further structural reforms would go a long way toward fixing this problem, but they will also require China’s leaders to make tough political decisions that won’t please everyone.
Another fundamental challenge is China’s slow rate of urbanization, which is still lagging, even after 25 years of export-led growth.
Each of a thriving service economy’s major components – ICT, finance, insurance, transportation, and real estate – needs the others to prosper, and cities are what bring them all together – a phenomenon of network externalities.
Unfortunately, China’s enduring system of dividing urban and rural regions, together with poor urban planning, has led to fragmented and scattered metropolitan communities without diversified networks that would otherwise have helped boost productivity.
China’s cities will be a key ingredient of its long-term economic success.
Urbanization should start accelerating today, and over the next 10-15 years, with the expansion of metropolitan areas geared toward the needs of services-led economic growth.
If China can rise to that challenge, it will be well positioned to clear the remaining hurdles in its path toward high-income status.
China’s Weapons of Trade War
BEIJING – China exports more to the United States than the US exports to China.
That makes US President Donald Trump furious – so furious, in fact, that he may be willing to start a trade war over it.
Trump has leveled tough protectionist threats against China.
As he attempts to consolidate his presidency, he is unlikely to back away from them.
And with the Communist Party of China’s 19th National Congress set to take place in Beijing in November, Chinese leaders are unlikely to yield to US pressure.
A trade war would undoubtedly hurt both sides.
But there is reason to believe that the US has more to lose.
If nothing else, the Chinese seem to know precisely which weapons they have available to them.
China could stop purchasing US aircraft, impose an embargo on US soybean products, and dump US Treasury securities and other financial assets.
Chinese enterprises could reduce their demand for US business services, and the government could persuade companies not to buy American.
The bulk of numerous Fortune 500 companies’ annual sales come from China nowadays – and they already feel increasingly unwelcome.
Beyond being America’s second most important trading partner, China is America’s main jobs supplier.
A trade war could thus cost the US millions of jobs.
If China switched from Boeing to Airbus, for example, the US would lose some 179,000 jobs.
Reduction in US business services would cost another 85,000 jobs.
Soybean-producing regions – for example, in Missouri and Mississippi – could lose some 10% of local jobs if China halted imports.
Moreover, though the US exports less to China than vice versa, it is China that controls key components in global supply chains and production networks.
Consider the iPhone.
While China provides just 4% of value added, it supplies the core components to Apple at low prices.
Apple cannot build an iPhone from scratch in the US, so it would have to search for alternative suppliers, raising its production costs considerably.
This would give Chinese smartphone businesses an opportunity to seize market share from major players.
Today, 80% of global trade comprises international supply chains.
Declining trade costs have allowed firms to splinter their production lines geographically, with goods processed and value added in multiple countries along the chain.
If China threw a handful of sand in the gears of these chains, it could disrupt entire production networks, doing serious damage to the US (and, indeed, all the countries participating in such networks).
An escalating trade war, with each side erecting symmetric import barriers, would fuel inflationary pressure in the US, potentially driving the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates higher and faster than it would otherwise.
That, together with diminished growth prospects, would depress equity markets, and declining employment and household income could lead to a sizeable loss of GDP in both the US and China.
A more likely scenario, however, is that both countries would initiate disputes in specific sectors, particularly traditional manufacturing industries like iron and steel production.
Meanwhile, Trump will continue to accuse China of manipulating its exchange rate, ignoring the recent downward pressure on the renminbi (which indicates that the currency was actually overvalued), not to mention the simple fact that many governments intervene to manage their exchange rates.
Both Japan and Switzerland have engaged in outright currency intervention in recent years, and the US itself may well join their ranks, when the strong dollar’s impact on US export competitiveness becomes untenable.
In any case, China can probably forget about achieving “market economy status” under World Trade Organization rules until after Trump is out of the White House.
The trade confrontation between the US and China will also affect bilateral investment flows.
The US may cite national security concerns to block Chinese investments.
It may also stop government purchases from Chinese companies like Huawei, and force Chinese firms and wealthy individuals to reduce investments that have hitherto bolstered US asset prices.
A high-quality US-China bilateral investment treaty would create a level playing field for American companies, giving them better access to China’s large market.
But those talks will invariably be pushed back, while disputes over intellectual property rights and cyber security will be reinvigorated.
For now, China’s leaders seem convinced that they have little reason to bend to US pressure.
For one thing, Trump seems more concerned with other priorities, such as repealing the US Affordable Care Act, reforming the tax system, and investing in infrastructure.
Even if a trade war does happen, China’s leaders assume, it probably would not be sustained for long, given the income and job losses that both sides would suffer.
In any case, they have no intention of sending any signal of weakness to a leader so intent on testing other’s limits.
For the past five years, China has sought to establish a growth model that is less reliant on exports and more reliant on domestic consumption.
But China often needs a crisis or an external shock to drive reform.
Perhaps Trump is that shock.
While his policies will be bad for China in the short term, they may also provide the impetus China needs to stop subsidizing exports and perpetuating distortions in the domestic economy.
If this happens, China may actually emerge from the era of Trump better off than before.
Optimizing Decision-Making in a Dangerous World
CAMBRIDGE AND NEW YORK – The United States and China have reached a precarious moment in their relationship.
Ensuring a peaceful outcome will be the greatest geopolitical challenge of the twenty-first century.
Are our leaders up to it?
As things stand today, the risks seem only to be escalating.
US President Donald Trump’s administration has imposed economic sanctions on Chinese entities with financial ties to North Korea, because it does not believe that China has done enough to constrain the North Korean regime.
And, as Trump has said bluntly, if the Chinese don’t deal with North Korea, he will.
As North Korea inches closer to developing a nuclear-tipped missile that can hit the continental US, Trump has threatened the country with “fire and fury like the world has never seen.”
China, for its part, rejects what its foreign ministry has called the “China responsibility theory” regarding North Korea.
A recent editorial in a Chinese state-run newspaper asserted that while China would stay neutral if North Korea attacked first, US strikes aimed at regime change would cause China to intervene.
The Chinese also responded furiously to the passage of a US naval warship through disputed waters in the South China Sea last month, a move that the foreign ministry called a “provocation” that “severely undermines China’s sovereignty and security.”
While these issues are modern, the underlying political dynamic is not new.
Describing a similar power struggle in classical Greece, the historian Thucydides wrote that, “It was the rise of Athens, and the fear that this instilled in Sparta, that made war inevitable.”
Across the ages, the so-called Thucydides Trap has appeared repeatedly, fueling tensions between rising and reigning powers that caused otherwise manageable events to fuel cycles of action and reaction that ended in devastating wars.
Over the last 500 years, in 16 cases where a rising power threatened to displace a ruling power, 12 led to war.
The US and China should take note: business as usual is likely to produce history as usual.
But, beyond dire warnings, history offers instructive clues for avoiding conflict.
Consider the seemingly insurmountable dilemma faced by US President Franklin Roosevelt in 1940, when the United Kingdom was under serious strain in its fight against Nazi Germany.
The UK’s supplies and money were running low, but Roosevelt knew that the US Congress would never simply loan Britain the money it needed.
Roosevelt’s problem “seemed insoluble,” writes historian Doris Kearns Goodwin in her book No Ordinary Time.
But Roosevelt did something that would seem inconceivable in today’s political climate: he took a ten-day break on a navy ship, and gave the predicament the thought it deserved.
Then, too, the idea of the US president escaping from the world at a critical juncture initially drew criticism.
“I didn’t know for quite a while what he was thinking about, if anything,” Roosevelt aide Harry Hopkins later said.
“But then – I began to get the idea that he was refueling, the way he so often does when he seems to be resting and carefree.
So I didn’t ask him any questions.
Then, one evening, he suddenly came out with it – the whole program.”
Hopkins was referring to the groundbreaking $50 billion Lend-Lease Act, which became the primary means by which the US provided military aid to foreign countries during World War II.
Through that program, the president could transfer defense materials for which Congress had appropriated funds to the government of any country whose defense was considered vital to US security, without requiring compensation.
Today, leaders are under extraordinary pressure to apply similarly inspired decision-making skills to an array of daunting challenges.
Beyond deepening tensions between China and the US, they must confront Russia’s growing assertiveness, the Middle East’s continued instability, and the looming specter of catastrophic climate change.
How many have the courage to learn from Roosevelt’s approach?
It is hard to imagine Trump following in FDR’s footsteps.
But to insist that the most certain path to potentially catastrophic decisions begins with an exhausted, intemperate mind is not a partisan observation.
The Stoics understood this.
In his 19 years as Rome’s emperor, Marcus Aurelius faced nearly constant war, a horrific plague, and a coup attempt.
But instead of lashing out at those he presumed were against him, Aurelius calmly asked himself, “Does what’s happened keep you from acting with justice, generosity, self-control, sanity, prudence, honesty, humility, straightforwardness, and all other qualities that allow a person’s nature to fulfill itself?”
Chinese wisdom offers another helpful perspective.
Central to Taoism is the concept of wu wei, which can be literally translated as “non-action,” but is really much more than that.
In Taoism, when we are in a state of harmony and connection with ourselves, we operate in a kind of effortless, intuitive, and spontaneous way.
Looking back on his own presidency, Bill Clinton recognized the dangers of burnout.
“Every important mistake I’ve made in my life, I’ve made because I was too tired,” he once said.
David Gergen, in his book Eyewitness to Power, detailed the costs of Clinton’s undisciplined rest habits in the first period of his presidency.
“Clinton was still celebrating the victory and loved staying up half the night to laugh and talk with old friends,” he wrote.
This had a visible impact on the president, who according to Gergen, “seemed worn out, puffy, and hyper,” as well as “out of sorts, easily distracted, and impatient.”
Creating the time and the space needed to recharge, refuel, and reflect is essential for the human operating system to function optimally.
That is not a systemic bug; it’s a powerful feature – one that leaders today should be using to its fullest extent.
The China Factor in Kenya and Zimbabwe
BEIJING – Ask anyone with a basic knowledge of Africa which country is more poised for success – Zimbabwe or Kenya – and he or she will undoubtedly answer “Kenya.”
Events of the last week would seem to confirm that verdict.
On Monday, after Kenya’s Supreme Court upheld the reelection of President Uhuru Kenyatta in the country’s contested presidential election, the rule of law seemed to trump political violence for the first time in years.
Zimbabwe, on the other hand, is without President Robert Mugabe for the first time in 37 years.
And, although the country may be ecstatic now, its political future is far from certain.
But as a Kenyan living in China, one of the African continent’s most important development partners, I see one metric that tips the scale in Zimbabwe’s favor: its relationship with my adopted home.
In fact, Zimbabwe’s economic and political ties to China could prove decisive for Africa’s perpetual underdog.
On paper, Kenya clearly has the edge.
Although Zimbabwe has more natural resources and mineral wealth, it has far less land and extreme poverty is much more widespread.
More than 70% of the country’s 16 million people live on less than $1.90 a day, compared to 46% of Kenya’s 48 million people.
Moreover, as many as 90% of Zimbabweans are unemployed or underemployed, compared to 39% of Kenyans.
Even Kenya’s economic links to China might seem more impressive at first glance.
Kenya and China have long cooperated on large infrastructure projects.
A Chinese-funded railway between Nairobi and Mombasa, which opened earlier this year, is the latest example.
Since 2000, China has offered Kenya $6.8 billion in loans for infrastructure projects, compared to $1.7 billion for Zimbabwe.
And, because loan conditions often include a requirement to hire Chinese employees, Kenya had more than 7,400 at the end of 2015, while Zimbabwe had just over 950.
But in the competition for Chinese largesse, Kenya’s advantage over Zimbabwe ends there.
Cumulative Chinese foreign direct investment since 2003 has reached nearly $7 billion in Zimbabwe, compared to $3.9 billion for Kenya.
Year on year, more Chinese money is flowing to Zimbabwe as well.
Moreover, Zimbabwe’s trade balance with China is far superior to Kenya’s.
In 2015, Kenya’s exports to China totaled $99 million, while it imported from China a staggering 60 times that amount.
Even taking into account imports of materials tied to Chinese-built infrastructure, this is an exceptionally wide bilateral deficit.
Zimbabwe, on the other hand, despite its slow growth rate, exported $766 million worth of goods to China in 2015, and imported $546 million.
Most surprisingly, Zimbabwe’s exports were not restricted to minerals and metals, as one might assume, but also included tobacco and cotton, products that are relatively more labor-intensive, meaning more job creation at home.
And, while Zimbabwe has around 50 fewer registered Chinese companies than Kenya, Kenya’s economy is around 4.5 times the size of Zimbabwe’s, clearly implying that those firms that are operating there contribute more to the country’s economy.
How has Zimbabwe achieved what looks like, at least from a numerical perspective, a more productive relationship with China than Kenya has?
Few beyond Mugabe and his close colleagues, including the country’s new president, Emmerson Mnangagwa, know for sure.
But one way to make an educated guess is to compare both countries’ history of bilateral engagement with China.
Both Kenya and Zimbabwe have had two visits from Chinese heads of state during their post-colonial histories.
Chinese President Jiang Zemin visited each country in 1996, while President Hu Jintao visited Kenya in 2006.
China’s current president, Xi Jinping, visited Zimbabwe in 2015.
State visits in the other direction have been more uneven.
Mugabe’s first visit to China was in 1980, just six months after independence; he made 13 more during his tenure, and high-level visits by other Zimbabwean officials were even more frequent, occurring roughly once every two years during Mugabe’s reign.
Kenyan presidents, by contrast, traveled to China just six times during the same period, most recently in May 2017.
Zimbabwe’s leaders made the most of their visits to press for trade and military cooperation, and likely engaged directly with private Chinese companies.
This has nurtured a culture of reciprocity.
Just a few months ago, for example, a Chinese company approached my firm asking for advice about how to enter Zimbabwe’s health-care market.
I have not yet fielded similar questions about gaining access to markets in Kenya.
China’s role in African economies has been criticized; but, as I have argued before, Chinese investment has also been a lifeline to many on the continent.
From creating employment opportunities to providing direct investment in infrastructure, China has been a partner to Africa when many Western investors preferred to stay away.
How Kenya and Zimbabwe navigate their future relationships with China remains to be seen.
Both countries have supported Xi’s signature Belt and Road Initiative, which, in theory, should increase their strategic value to China.
Kenya’s return to political stability should also sustain, if not deepen, the country’s economic engagement with China.
Zimbabwe’s historic ties to China will be no less important.
Following Mugabe’s resignation, China’s foreign ministry went out of its way to praise the “friendship between China and Zimbabwe,” and Mnangagwa can be expected to continue that relationship.
The new president received military training in China, and paid an official visit as speaker of the parliament in 2001.
There is even speculation that China was warned of the looming coup in Zimbabwe, if not consulted beforehand.
As Kenya and Zimbabwe navigate their political futures, much in both countries will no doubt change – one hopes for the better.
Their ties with China will be a key metric in assessing their trajectory.
Inclusive Growth Depends on Cities
PARIS, WASHINGTON, DC – We live in turbulent times, and popular discontent with the status quo is mounting.
The reasons for popular frustration vary from country to country, but the common thread everywhere is a growing sense that the economy is rigged in favor of the few.
Indeed, the gains from economic growth are increasingly going to the very highest earners.
In OECD countries, people in the top 10% of the income distribution earn around ten times more than people in the bottom 10% – up from seven times more nearly 30 years ago.
In 2012, among the 18 OECD countries with comparable data, the top 10% accounted for 50% of total household wealth, while the bottom 40% accounted for only 3%.
We all pay a price when inequality reaches new heights.
In a range of OECD countries, rising inequality knocked 6-10 percentage points off overall GDP between 1990 and 2010.
When the poorest people are unable to fulfill their potential, economic growth suffers.
As policymakers and political leaders look for ways to make economic growth more inclusive, cities will play a central role in any solution.
A survey of OECD countries shows that half the total population lives in cities of more than 500,000 inhabitants, and that cities have accounted for 60% of total growth of employment and GDP since 2001.
However, this growth has not been inclusive: income inequality in cities is higher than the national average in all OECD countries surveyed, except Canada.
In the United States, 95 of the 100 largest metropolitan areas added jobs and increased their economic output in the five years following the Great Recession, but only 20 experienced median-wage growth.
Economic gains in recent years have not made the typical worker better off, and as wealthy individuals have reaped the benefits of growth, poverty has become more concentrated.
According to research by the Brookings Institution, the number of extremely poor neighborhoods in the US has more than doubled since 2000.
This has far-reaching costs.
Growing up in a poor neighborhood has been shown to reduce a person’s life prospects dramatically, even when earnings remain constant.
And in metropolitan areas such as London and Baltimore, the difference in life expectancy between poor and wealthy neighborhoods just a few miles apart can be more than 20 years.
As the site of both economic opportunity and disparity, cities are where we must look to tackle inequality.
In March, the OECD, the Ford Foundation, Brookings, and other institutions launched the Inclusive Growth in Cities Initiative, in partnership with New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and 20 other mayors from around the world.
By bringing together “Champion Mayors” to define a shared inclusive-growth agenda, the Initiative acknowledges the crucial role mayors play in creating economic opportunity and boosting the productive capacity of individuals and firms.
At a recent Brookings event, OECD Secretary-General Angel Gurría discussed four key areas where cities can work to reduce inequality.
These ideas will be developed further at a meeting in Paris on November 21, hosted by Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo.
First, cities should make education systems more inclusive by investing in vocational schools where people of all ages and backgrounds can learn marketable skills.
For example, in Atlanta, Mayor Kasim Reed has launched a partnership between a local startup incubator, the city’s workforce development agency, and a coding school to provide young people with mentorship networks, through which they can develop financial literacy and critical thinking skills, while also learning how to write code.
Second, cities should ensure that employment and entrepreneurship opportunities are available to all people, including women, young adults, immigrants, and disadvantaged populations.
In Stockholm, which took in 8,000 asylum-seekers between fall 2015 and spring 2016, Mayor Karin Wanngård is developing a new type of school for adults.
As part of a comprehensive integration strategy, the new schools will teach the language, cultural, and technical proficiencies necessary to participate in Stockholm’s job market.
In Seoul, Mayor Park Won-soon is leveling the playing field for small and medium-size enterprises with targeted financial support, fairer transaction and subcontracting rules, and informal-work regularization.
Third, cities must ensure high-quality, affordable housing for all in safe, healthy neighborhoods.
In Paris, Hidalgo’s “right of first refusal” plan allows the municipal government to acquire residences that come on the market in selected neighborhoods so that it can provide them to poorer residents at risk of being displaced.
Finally, cities should ensure that public infrastructure and services – including public transportation, water, energy, waste management, and broadband – are easily accessible for all.
In New York, de Blasio’s IDNYC initiative is providing free government-issued identification cards for all residents – including the homeless, undocumented immigrants, and former convicts – so that marginalized groups can make use of the city’s resources.
Efforts such as the Inclusive Growth in Cities Initiative and the United Nation’s Habitat III conference are helping to turn the tide against rising inequality one city at a time.
The more we can capitalize on local solutions for common global problems, the more progress all of us will make.
The Hidden Wealth of Cities
STOCKHOLM – The world is becoming increasingly urbanized, as more people are choosing to live in towns and cities than ever before.
The trouble is, most urban areas are unprepared to manage the influx.
Cities around the world face a looming investment crisis that makes them less livable than they should be.
The maintenance of vital social and economic infrastructure, not to mention development planning, is being delayed because of a lack of cash.
With local governments’ finances burdened by continuously expanding spending commitments, public resources in many cities are highly constrained.
It doesn’t have to be this way.
Even struggling cities own a range of commercial assets that can be used to reverse these trends.
Unlocking the public value of poorly utilized real estate, for example, or monetizing transportation and utility assets, could and should become core urban strategies.
This does not require privatization, but rather that assets could yield a reasonable return, freeing more resources than most cities currently have on hand.
In fact, through smarter asset management, cities could more than double their investments without having to raise taxes or cut spending.
For the last 50 years, government ownership of vast commercial holdings has triggered a polarized debate, especially in Europe, but recently also in the United States.
But private versus public ownership is a false dichotomy.
What matters most is the quality of professional management of such assets supporting local economies.
Compiling an accurate balance sheet – knowledge that is, despite its importance, shockingly rare in most cities – is a crucial step toward adopting a management-focused approach.
With a list of assets in hand, and a proper understanding of their market value, taxpayers, politicians, and investors can better reckon with the long-term consequences of political decisions.
They can also make better choices about mobilizing returns, and avoid the traditional routes of tax increases, debt-financed spending, or austerity.
For various reasons, cities generally do not assess the market value of their economic assets.
Consider a city like Boston, which, at first glance, does not appear to be particularly wealthy.
Its financial statements underestimate the true value of public assets, reporting total assets worth $3.8 billion, of which $1.4 billion is real estate.
That is slightly less than its liabilities of $4.6 billion in 2015.
But, like most cities, Boston reports its assets at book value, which are tied to the historic cost.
If holdings were reported using the International Financial Reporting Standards, which require the use of market value for assets, Boston’s holdings would be worth significantly more than what is currently reported.
In other words, the city is operating without fully understanding its hidden wealth.
And that wealth is vast.
An estimate of the market value of Boston’s property portfolio suggests that the city’s real estate alone is worth some $55 billion.
But, because Boston’s leaders have not accounted for this value, they cannot fully measure the cost of leaving these assets undermanaged.
If they could, they would get a sense of the benefits to be gained by developing these assets more astutely.
After accounting for the market value of municipal assets, the next step toward sound asset management is to understand the yield that a city earns from the revenue and rising market values of its assets.
This is crucial for comparing all investment options, but also for determining whether performance has been satisfactory, and to show stakeholders that their wealth is being managed responsibly.
Using Boston as an example again, let’s cautiously assume that the city could earn a 3% yield on its commercial assets with more professional and politically independent management.
A modest yield of 3% on a portfolio worth $55 billion would amount to an income exceeding its current total revenues, and many times more than Boston’s current capital plan.
Even with a modest yield, Boston could more than double its infrastructure investments.
Boston is by no means exceptional.
On the contrary, its approach to historical valuation is shared by cities worldwide.
As a result, public wealth is trapped in real estate and other non-optimized commercial assets.
The best way forward would be to consolidate publicly owned assets in a common investment vehicle that Stefan Fölster and I have called an “urban wealth fund.”
The fund would be managed at arm’s length in a transparent, accountable manner, guided by a city mandate but directed by a dedicated professional staff to keep it free from political influence.
This sounds challenging, but it canbe done.
Hamburg’s HafenCity GmbH, and parts of Copenhagen that were revitalized by the City & Port Development Company, are just two examples of urban areas that have used this type of development mechanism.
These efforts have not only increased the amount of residential housing; they have also funded vital infrastructure such as the Copenhagen Metro, schools, and universities.
In Hamburg, the recently opened Elbe Symphony Hall was also funded via a government-owned holding company.
Managing city assets better would help local leaders boost their economies, finance social and economic infrastructure, and develop strategies for vibrant and innovative mixed-use projects.
Better management of city assets would also help cover the costs of required maintenance without competing with government budgets, leaving more for spending on health care, education, and other social initiatives.
As urban populations grow, city planners must become more adept at budgeting for the long term.
And there is no better way to do that than by using the assets that are already in place.
The High Cost of Denying Class War
ATHENS – The Anglosphere’s political atmosphere is thick with bourgeois outrage.
In the United States, the so-called liberal establishment is convinced it was robbed by an insurgency of “deplorables” weaponized by Vladimir Putin’s hackers and Facebook’s sinister inner workings.
In Britain, too, an incensed bourgeoisie are pinching themselves that support for leaving the European Union in favor of an inglorious isolation remains undented, despite a process that can only be described as a dog’s Brexit.
The range of analysis is staggering.
The rise of militant parochialism on both sides of the Atlantic is being investigated from every angle imaginable: psychoanalytically, culturally, anthropologically, aesthetically, and of course in terms of identity politics.
The only angle that is left largely unexplored is the one that holds the key to understanding what is going on: the unceasing class war unleashed upon the poor since the late 1970s.
In 2016, the year of both Brexit and Trump, two pieces of data, dutifully neglected by the shrewdest of establishment analysts, told the story.
In the United States, more than half of American families did not qualify, according to Federal Reserve data, to take out a loan that would allow them to buy the cheapest car for sale (the Nissan Versa sedan, priced at $12,825).
Meanwhile, in the United Kingdom, over 40% of families relied on either credit or food banks to feed themselves and cover basic needs.
William of Ockham, the fourteenth-century British philosopher, famously postulated that, when bamboozled in the face of competing explanations, we ought to opt for the one with the fewest assumptions and the greatest simplicity.
For all the deftness of establishment commentators in the US and Britain, they seem to have neglected this principle.
Loath to recognize the intensified class war, they bang on interminably with conspiracy theories about Russian influence, spontaneous bursts of misogyny, the tide of migrants, the rise of the machines, and so on.
While all of these fears are highly correlated with the militant parochialism fueling Trump and Brexit, they are only tangential to the deeper cause – class war against the poor – alluded to by the car affordability data in the US and the credit-dependence of much of Britain’s population.
True, some relatively affluent middle-class voters also supported Trump and Brexit.
But much of that support rode on the coattails of the fear caused by observing the classes just below theirs plunge into despair and loathing, while their own children’s prospects dimmed.
Twenty years ago, the same liberal commentators were cultivating the impossible dream that globalizing financialized capitalism would deliver prosperity for most.
At a time when capital was becoming more concentrated on a global scale, and more militant against non-owners of assets, they were declaring the class war over.
As the working class was growing in size worldwide, even though its jobs and employment prospects were shrinking in the Anglosphere, these elites behaved as if class were passé.
The 2008 financial collapse and the subsequent Great Recession buried that dream.
Still, liberals ignored the undeniable fact that the gigantic losses incurred by the quasi-criminal financial sector were cynically transferred onto the shoulders of a working class they thought no longer mattered.
For all their self-image as progressives, the elites’ readiness to ignore widening class divisions, and to replace it with class-blind identity politics, was the greatest gift to toxic populism.
In Britain, the Labour Party (under Tony Blair, Gordon Brown, and Edward Miliband) was too coy even to mention the post-2008 intensification of the class war against the majority, leading to the rise across the Labour heartland of the UK Independence Party (UKIP), with its Brexit parochialism.
Polite society seemed not to give a damn that it had become easier to get into Harvard or Cambridge if you were black than if you were poor.
They deliberately ignored that identity politics can be as divisive as apartheid if allowed to act as a lever for overlooking class conflict.
Trump had no compunction to speak clearly about class, and to embrace – however deceitfully – those too poor to buy a car, let alone send their children to Harvard.
Brexiteers, too, embraced the “great unwashed,” reflected in images of UKIP leader Nigel Farage drinking in pubs with “average blokes.”
And when large swaths of the working class turned against the establishment’s favorite sons and daughters (the Clintons, the Bushes, the Blairs, and the Camerons), endorsing militant parochialism, the commentariat blamed the riffraff’s illusions about capitalism.
But it was not illusions about capitalism that led to the discontent that fueled Trump and Brexit.
Rather, it is the disillusion with middle-of-the-road politics of the kind that intensified the class war against them.
Predictably, the embrace of the working class by Trump and the Brexiteers was always going to arm them with electoral power that, sooner or later, would be deployed against working-class interests and, of course, minorities – always the penchant of populism in power, from the 1930s to today.
Trump has thus used his working-class support to usher in scandalous tax reforms, whose naked ambition is to help the plutocracy while millions of Americans face reduced health coverage and, as the federal budget deficit balloons, higher long-term tax bills.
Similarly, Britain’s Tory government, which has espoused Brexit’s populist aims, has recently announced another multi-billion-pound reduction in social security, education, and tax credits for the working poor.
Those cuts are matched exactly by reductions in corporate and inheritance tax cuts.
Today, establishment opinion-makers, who scornfully rejected the pertinence of social class, have contributed to a political environment in which class politics was never more pertinent, toxic, and less discussed.
Speaking on behalf of a ruling class comprising financial experts, bankers, corporate representatives, media owners, and big industry functionaries, they act exactly as if their goal were to deliver the working classes into the grubby hands of the populists and their empty promise of making America and Britain “great again.”
The only prospect for civilizing society and detoxifying politics is a new political movement that harnesses on behalf of a new humanism the burning injustice that class war manufactures.
Judging by its callous treatment of US Senator Bernie Sanders and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, the liberal establishment seems to fear such a movement more than it does Trump and Brexit.
In Defense of the 1.5°C Climate Change Threshold
MANILA – The Earth today is more than 1°C hotter than it was in pre-industrial times, and the terrible symptoms of its fever are already showing.
This year alone, back-to-back hurricanes have devastated Caribbean islands, monsoon flooding has displaced tens of millions in South Asia, and fires have raged on nearly every continent.
Pulling the planet back from the brink could not be more urgent.
Those of us who live on the front lines of climate change – on archipelagos, small islands, coastal lowlands, and rapidly desertifying plains – can’t afford to wait and see what another degree of warming will bring.
Already, far too many lives and livelihoods are being lost.
People are being uprooted, and vital resources are becoming increasingly scarce, while those suffering the most severe consequences of climate change are also among those who have done the least to cause it.
That is why the Philippines used its chairmanship of the Climate Vulnerable Forum (CVF) – an alliance of the 48 countries that stand to bear the brunt of climate change – to fight to ensure that the 2015 Paris climate agreement aimed explicitly to cap global warming at 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels.
For us, 1.5°C isn’t merely a symbolic or “aspirational” number to be plugged into international agreements; it is an existential limit.
If global temperatures rise above that level, the places we call home – and many other homes on this planet – will become uninhabitable or even disappear completely.
When we first introduced the 1.5°C target back in 2009, we met substantial resistance.
Climate-change deniers – those who refuse to believe the science of human-induced global warming – continue to dismiss any such effort to stem the rise in the planet’s temperature as futile and unnecessary.
But even well-meaning climate advocates and policymakers often opposed the 1.5°C target, arguing that, according to the science, humans had already emitted enough greenhouse gases to make meeting that goal virtually impossible.
Yet, on this front, the science is not as clear-cut as it might have seemed.
According to a recent paper published in Nature, the world’s remaining “carbon budget” – the amount of carbon-dioxide equivalents we can emit before breaching the 1.5°C threshold – is somewhat larger than was previously thought.
This finding is no reason for complacency, as some commentators (not scientists) seem to think.
It does not mean that previous climate models were excessively alarmist, or that we can take a more relaxed approach to reining in global warming.
Instead, the paper should inspire – and, indeed, calls for – more immediate, deliberate, and aggressive action to ensure that greenhouse-gas emissions peak within a few years and net-zero emissions are achieved by mid-century.
What would such action look like?
Global emissions would need to be reduced by 4-6% every year, until they reached zero.
Meanwhile, forest and agricultural lands would have to be restored, so that they could capture and sequester greater amounts of carbon dioxide.
Fully decarbonizing our energy and transportation systems in four decades will require a herculean effort, but it is not impossible.
Beyond their environmental consequences, such efforts would generate major economic gains, boosting the middle class in developed countries and pulling hundreds of millions out of poverty in the developing world, including by fueling job creation.
The energy transition will lead to massive efficiency savings, while improving the resilience of infrastructure, supply chains, and urban services in developing countries, particularly those in vulnerable regions.
According to a report published last year by the United Nations Development Programme, maintaining the 1.5°C threshold and creating a low-carbon economy would add as much as $12 trillion to global GDP, compared to a scenario in which the world sticks to current policies and emissions-reduction pledges.
The paper asserting that the 1.5°C target is achievable was written by well-respected climate experts and published in a top-ranking journal after extensive peer review.
But it is just one paper; there is still a lot more to learn about our capacity to limit global warming.
That is why top scientists are already discussing and debating its findings; their responses will also be published in top journals.
That is how scientific research works, and it is why we can trust climate science – and its urgent warnings.
Next year, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change will publish its own meta-analysis of all of the science related to the 1.5°C target, in what promises to be the most comprehensive summary of such research.
But we cannot afford to wait for that analysis before taking action.
The members of the CVF have already committed to doing our part, pledging at last year’s UN Climate Change Conference in Marrakech to complete the transition to 100% renewable energy as soon as possible.
Our emissions are already among the world’s smallest, but our climate targets are the world’s most ambitious.
But whether the world manages to curb climate change ultimately will depend on the willingness of the largest current and historical emitters of greenhouse gases to fulfill their moral and ethical responsibility to take strong action.
Keeping global temperatures below 1.5°C may not yet be a geophysical impossibility.
But, to meet the target, we must ensure that it is not treated as a political and economic impossibility, either.
Sounding the Alarm on Biodiversity Loss
NORWICH – With the United Nations’ climate change conference underway in Bonn, Germany, rising global temperatures are once again at the top of the world’s agenda.
But why care about the increase in temperature, if not because of its impact on life on Earth, including human life?
That is an important question to consider, in view of the relative lack of attention devoted to a closely related and equally important threat to human survival: the startling pace of global biodiversity loss.
The availability of food, water, and energy – fundamental building blocks of every country’s security – depends on healthy, robust, and diverse ecosystems, and on the life that inhabits them.
But, as a result of human activities, planetary biodiversity is now declining faster than at any point in history.
Many policymakers, however, have yet to recognize that biodiversity loss is just as serious a threat as rising sea levels and increasingly frequent extreme weather events.
This lack of sufficient attention comes despite international commitments to protect biodiversity.
In October 2010, global leaders met in Aichi, Japan, where they produced the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020, which included 20 ambitious targets – such as halving global habitat loss and ending overfishing – that signatories agreed to meet by 2020.
Safeguarding biodiversity is also specifically included in the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals.
Yet progress toward these global biodiversity goals is likely to fall dangerously short of what is needed to ensure an acceptable future for all.
Policymakers have largely agreed on the importance of holding the increase in global temperature to less than 2°C above pre-industrial levels – the goal of the Paris climate agreement.
But too few leaders have shown any sense of urgency about stemming biodiversity losses.
The sustainable future we want depends on ending this indifference.
Toward that end, the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), which I chair, will release a series of landmark reports next March on the implications of biodiversity decline.
Prepared over three years by more than 550 experts from some 100 countries, these expert assessments will cover four world regions: the Americas, Asia and the Pacific, Africa, and Europe and Central Asia.
A fifth report will address the state of land degradation and restoration at regional and global levels.
The reports will highlight trends and plausible futures, outlining the best policy options available to slow the degradation of ecosystems, from coral reefs to rainforests.
Taken together, the IPBES assessments will represent the global scientific community’s consensus view on the state of biodiversity and ecosystem services.
Moreover, the reports will highlight the close links between biodiversity loss and climate change, which should be addressed simultaneously.
The world will not be able to meet the goals of the Paris agreement – or many of the SDGs, for that matter – unless it takes into account the state of biodiversity and ecosystem services.
Today, most governments separate their environmental authorities from those focusing on energy, agriculture, and planning.
This makes it difficult to address climate change or biodiversity losses in a holistic way.
New types of innovative governance structures are needed to bridge these policy silos.
After the release of IPBES regional reports next year, a global assessment building on them will be published in 2019.
This will be the first global overview of biodiversity and ecosystem services since the authoritative Millennium Ecosystem Assessment of 2005.
It will examine the health of terrestrial, freshwater, and marine ecosystems, and the impact of factors including acidification, rising sea surface temperatures, trade, invasive species, overfishing, pollution, and land use changes.
The success of efforts to reverse unsustainable uses of the world’s natural assets will require policymakers to reconsider the value of biodiversity for their people, environments, and economies.
But the first step is ensuring that we have the best peer-reviewed knowledge available to make sound decisions; the forthcoming IPBES assessments will move us in that direction.
If the full consequences of climate change are to be addressed in our lifetime, we must recognize that human activity is doing more than just adding a few degrees of temperature to the annual forecast.
By early next year, we will have the data on biodiversity and ecosystem services to prove it, and the policy options to change course.
Carbon Pricing Takes Off
BONN – The hurricanes that pummeled the Caribbean, Texas, and Florida this year left highways submerged, homes and businesses demolished, and lives lost.
The floodwaters have since receded, but the images of upheaval remain etched in our collective memory.
Recovery will take years, perhaps decades, and it will cost billions of dollars.
Experts tell us that warming oceans are causing hurricanes to become more powerful, and other consequences of anthropogenic climate change – from severe droughts in the Horn of Africa to extreme flooding in Asia – are leaving millions without food and basic shelter.
But while the link between burning fossil fuels and deadly weather has been strengthening for years, policymakers have not always heeded the warnings.
This is changing rapidly.
Today, countries, citizens, and a growing number of businesses around the world are finally taking action.
This month, thousands gathered for the UN’s climate change conference in Bonn, Germany, to ratchet up global ambition in the fight against climate change.
Following the successful Paris climate agreement two years ago, expectations for further progress and continued collaboration are high.
One of the more promising recent initiatives is the Carbon Pricing Leadership Coalition (CPLC), which brings together 30 governments and more than 180 businesses and strategic partners to put a value on carbon dioxide emissions.
The idea is simple: if we are to meet the Paris accord’s target of limiting the increase in global average temperature to less than 2° Celsius above preindustrial levels – ideally, to 1.5° above preindustrial levels – we must dramatically cut emissions.
As co-chairs of the CPLC, we believe that one of the best ways to do that is by shifting the social and economic costs of heat-trapping gases from the public to the polluter.
With the sense of climate urgency increasing, it is no longer acceptable to pollute for free and pass the bill to future generations.
Putting a price on carbon is the most efficient way to reduce global emissions while encouraging sustainable and robust economic growth.
Moreover, by putting a price on pollution, governments can generate revenue for investments like clean energy, schools, and health care, making it a double win.
The ultimate goal, of course, is to encourage businesses to clean up their acts, and today, a growing share of business leaders understand that pricing carbon is one of the best ways to combat climate change.
They also recognize that their businesses can thrive even as they work to reduce emissions.
In fact, many business leaders are among the most enthusiastic supporters of effective carbon pricing.
Just last month, the Carbon Disclosure Project revealed that the number of companies with plans to pursue internal carbon price mechanisms has grown to almost 1,400 globally, up from 150 in 2014.
This includes more than 100 of the world’s largest companies, with total annual revenues of some $7 trillion.
Royal DSM (which is led by one of the authors) has set a carbon price of €50 ($59) per ton, joining other global companies like Michelin, Danone, and General Motors in applying meaningful carbon prices to “future-proof” their business.
Some 40 countries – including Canada – are also putting a price on carbon pollution, and more governments are planning to implement similar schemes soon.
In 2015, China announced plans to create the world’s largest carbon-pricing system.
And earlier this year, Ontario, Québec, and California signed an agreement to create the world’s second-largest carbon market.
This trend must continue – for environmental and economic reasons.
A May 2017 study conducted by the High-Level Commission on Carbon Prices – led by two of the world’s top economists, Joseph E. Stiglitz and Nicholas Stern – found that setting a “strong carbon price” is essential not only for reducing global emissions, but also for sustaining innovation and growth.
To be sure, putting a price on carbon pollution must become part of a broader set of actions to future-proof our economies and societies.
To reduce greenhouse-gas emissions further and foster economic vitality, we must improve public transportation; construct energy-efficient buildings; and support efforts by businesses, innovators, and investors to develop clean-energy solutions.
This is what Canada is already doing, because we know that these policies can reduce emissions and help create new, well-paying jobs.
As is often said, climate change represents both a challenge and an opportunity.
By pricing carbon pollution and harnessing our collective abilities, we can address the former and seize the latter.
Pooling the innovative and entrepreneurial spirit found in countries and businesses will enable us to fight climate change, strengthen our economies and societies, and leave our children and grandchildren a healthier planet.
The Climate-Conflict Nexus
BOSTON – Yemen and South Sudan are, in many ways, worlds apart.
But, despite vast differences in history, tradition, and culture, both countries share one painful feature: their people are now bearing the brunt of two of the most devastating manmade crises: violent conflict and climate change.
South Sudan has been mired in conflict for nearly a decade.
In the last five years alone, tens of thousands have died, and nearly a quarter of the population has been displaced, with many having little choice but to flee to neighboring Kenya, Uganda, or Sudan.
Yemen, for its part, has emerged as a major front in the ongoing struggle for regional influence between Saudi Arabia, which has ties to Yemen’s government, and Iran, which supports the Houthi rebel group.
In recent years, Saudi Arabia, in particular, has been carrying out devastating air strikes that have killed countless civilians and reduced Yemen’s infrastructure – including roads, schools, hospitals, apartment complexes, and markets – to rubble, leaving the country’s people without access to essential services.
With water and sanitation facilities knocked out, the country is now facing the worst cholera outbreak in modern history.
The effects of violent conflict are being exacerbated by climate change.
This year’s Climate Change Vulnerability Index ranks South Sudan among the world’s five most vulnerable countries, with the increase in temperature expected to be nearly two and a half times larger than the global average.
This will devastate an already-desperate country, where the livelihoods of 95% of the population depend on climate-related services, from agriculture to animal husbandry and fisheries.
Yemen, for its part, is considered among the clearest examples of the tangible consequences of climate change.
According to the World Bank, since 1970, irrigation in Yemen has increased by a factor of 15, as rain-fed agriculture has declined by nearly 30%.
The country faces both heavy rains and deadly floods – in 2008, floods in southeastern Yemen resulted in losses equivalent to 6% of GDP – and, at the other extreme, devastating droughts.
The global health community is now increasingly recognizing the extent to which the traditional consequences of war – such as injury, trauma, and displacement – are being compounded by the effects of climate change, which undermines nutrition and development.
For example, conflict can, as in Yemen, result in the contamination of water resources, which are already being depleted by climate change.
Similarly, malnutrition, rooted in the loss of crops and livelihoods from climate change, undermines people’s ability to recover from injuries sustained in violent conflict or endure the challenges of migration – a situation exacerbated by the destruction of health-care infrastructure.
The list goes on.
None of this is a matter of coincidence.
In fact, researchers are now concerned that conflict and climate change are mutually reinforcing, with economic and agricultural losses, as well as water shortages, triggering conflicts that then undermine health and livelihoods further.
In such an environment, outbreaks of an old disease (such as cholera) or a new one may lead to new regional and global pandemics.
The situation is further complicated by political calculations, including geostrategic considerations, like those behind Saudi Arabia’s actions in Yemen, and the rejection of scientific evidence in order to pander to constituents, as in the United States.
In fact, the withdrawal of US President Donald Trump’s administration from the Paris climate agreement is set to weaken the world’s collective ability to respond to climate change.
Cuts in aid funding for women’s health – another Trump administration policy – will not help matters.
The reality is that confronting the interconnected challenges associated with conflict and climate change demands comprehensive solutions.
Of course, influential countries – including China, France, and Germany – have a role to play in filling the gap left by the Trump administration’s retreat from global leadership.
But the scientific and public-health communities must also step up and rethink how to manage diseases and handle water shortages in conflict environments.
We have already seen what happens in the absence of systems-level solutions.
Consider the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa: despite ample support programs and infrastructure focused on confronting malaria, countries were not even remotely prepared to handle a new health challenge.
When Ebola emerged, the system simply broke down – with overwhelming human and economic consequences.
That is why the scientific and public-health communities must work urgently to deepen their understanding of the integrated challenges of conflict and climate change, finding and filling gaps in knowledge.
The first step is a clear-eyed assessment of the current state of affairs, which will surely produce a harsh reality check regarding the resilience and effectiveness of existing solutions.
It is time to recognize the speed at which the combined threat of conflict and climate change is spreading and intensifying, and that addressing it requires new multidisciplinary, evidence-based tools and solutions.
It is within our collective capacity to control, limit, and potentially even reverse the effects of the climate-conflict nexus.
But we have to do the work.
The Myth of a Fossil Fuel Phase-Out
BRUSSELS – How the world uses energy is a hot topic for a warming planet, and fears of pollution and resource strain have produced a virtual arms race of energy-efficiency strategies.
From the European Union to China, economies are vowing to reduce their energy intensity with the help of technological innovations and legislative changes.
Yet, despite these promises, consumer demand for energy is forecast by the International Energy Agency to rise until at least 2040.
With the world’s energy needs growing, how can policymakers guarantee supply?
To put it bluntly, the world has nothing to worry about when it comes to reserves.
After 40 years of fearing energy shortages, we have entered an era of abundance.
We need to guard against false narratives, not scarce resources.
The culprit of this storyline is the Club of Rome, a global think-tank that, in the 1970s, spurred energy anxiety with its absurd prophecies derived from questionable models.
As devoted followers of Thomas Malthus and Paul Ehrlich, the club argued that bad things come from exponential growth, and good things from linear growth.
This idea fueled the prediction that the world would run out of oil by 2000.
By adopting this nonsense dogma, developed countries enabled resource-rich authoritarian leaders like Muammar el-Qaddafi in Libya, and Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini in Iran, to use their oil reserves as tools to oppose the West – and particularly its support for Israel.
This contributed to the oil shocks of the 1970s, and reinforced the erroneous perception that hydrocarbon reserves were even more limited, and largely confined to the Middle East.
Rapid advances in technology, particularly in the field of exploration and the ability to extract hydrocarbons in new places, eventually upended such narratives.
Today’s energy “crisis” stems not from shortages, but from anxiety over pollution.
But this anxiety has not slowed our exploration habits.
On the contrary, politics and international law, like the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, have been adapted to enable discovery.
Consider, for example, the Rovuma gas field off the coast of Mozambique.
Today, a consortium of international companies from countries including Italy and China is preparing production, and one of Africa’s poorest countries is set to reap huge rewards.
Similarly, Israel, once thought to be the only place in the Middle East without hydrocarbons, is sitting on 800 billion cubic meters of offshore gas reserves, more than 130 years of the country’s current annual gas consumption.
Once a net energy importer, Israel today faces the very real challenge of exporting its gas bonanza.
But perhaps the biggest technology-driven upheaval for global energy markets in recent years has come from shale gas and shale oil production in the United States.
At 8.8 million barrels per day, US oil production is now higher than that of Iraq and Iran combined.
US shale gas is being delivered to Asia, Latin America, and parts of Europe.
These markets were long locked up by Qatar, Russia, and Australia, but now the global liquefied natural gas (LNG) industry, like the oil market, has entered a period of overproduction.
Taken together, these developments have contributed to lower energy prices, and reduced the strength of OPEC.
Furthermore, because LNG is favored by the transport sector (particularly freight and maritime shippers) for environmental reasons, the ability to use oil as a geopolitical weapon has disappeared.
Iran was so desperate to ramp up its oil exports that it agreed to abandon its nuclear program (strikingly, the Iran nuclear deal mentions the word “oil” 65 times).
Wind and solar are often presented as alternatives to oil and gas, but they cannot compete with traditional sources for electricity generation.
If they could, there would be no reason for the EU to support renewable energy production through legislation.
Moreover, while wind and solar technologies generate electricity, the biggest energy demand comes from heating.
In the EU, for example, electricity represents only 22% of final energy demand, while heating and cooling represents 45%; transportation accounts for the remaining 33%.
All of these factors help explain why fossil fuels, which currently meet more than 80% of the world’s energy needs, will remain the backbone of global energy production for the foreseeable future.
This may not come as welcome news to those pushing for an immediate phase-out of hydrocarbons.
But perhaps some solace can be gained from the fact that technological innovation will also play a key role in reducing the negative impacts on air and water quality.
Amid the global conversation about climate change, it is understandable that developed economies would promise significant gains in energy efficiency.
But while the EU may be committed to reducing CO2 emissions, other signatories of the 2015 Paris climate agreement do not seem as resolute.
It would not be surprising if most of the signatories actually raised their energy consumption in coming years, turning to fossil fuels because they cannot afford any other option.
Energy policy will remain on the agenda for advanced economies for many years to come.
But as countries work to balance security of supply with environmental goals, they must also commit to getting their facts straight.
The Geoengineering Fallacy
BERLIN – As the world struggles to rein in emissions of climate-changing gases and limit planetary warming, a new technological silver bullet is gaining supporters.
Geoengineering –the large-scale manipulation of the Earth’s natural systems – has been popularized as a means of counteracting the negative effects of climate change.
Proponents of this science feed the illusion that there is a way to engineer an exit from the climate crisis, meet the goals of the 2015 Paris climate agreement, and maintain a consumption-heavy lifestyle.
But this solution is not as simple as proponents would have us believe.
Betting on climate engineering – either as a planetary insurance policy or as a last-ditch measure to combat rising temperatures – is not only risky; it also directs attention away from the only solution we know will work: reducing carbon emissions.
Each of the engineered technologies being discussed carries dangers and uncertainties.
For example, the only way to test the effectiveness of solar radiation management (SRM) on a global scale would be to carry out experiments in the environment – either by spraying particles into the stratosphere, or by artificially modifying clouds.
While such tests would be designed to determine whether SRM could reflect enough sunlight to cool the planet, experimentation itself could cause irreversible damage.
Current models predict that SRM deployment would alter global precipitation patterns, damage the ozone layer, and undermine the livelihoods of millions of people.
Beyond the ecological risks, critics warn that, once deployed globally, SRM could spawn powerful weapons, giving states, corporations, or individuals the ability to manipulate climate for strategic gain (an idea that not even Hollywood can resist).
But perhaps the most important criticism is a political one: in a world of challenged multilateralism, how would global ecological interventions be governed?
Similar questions surround the other major group of climate engineering technologies under debate – so-called carbon dioxide removal (CDR).
Proponents of these technologies propose removing CO2 from the atmosphere and storing it underground or in the oceans.
Some CDR approaches are already prohibited, owing to concerns about possible environmental consequences.
For example, fertilization of oceans with carbon-sequestering plankton was banned by the London Protocol on marine pollution in 2008.
Parties to that decision worried about the potential damage to marine life.
But other CDR approaches are gaining support.
One of the most discussed ideas aims to integrate biomass with carbon capture and storage (CCS) techniques.
Called “bioenergy with CCS,” or BECCS, this method seeks to pair the CO2-absorption capabilities of fast-growing plants with underground CO2 storage methods.
Proponents argue that BECCS would actually yield “negative” emissions.
Yet, as with other engineered solutions, the promises are simply too good to be true.
For example, huge amounts of energy, water, and fertilizer would be required to operate BECCS systems successfully.
The effects on land use would likely lead to terrestrial species losses, and increase land competition and displacement of local populations.
Some forecasts even suggest that the land clearing and construction activities associated with these projects could lead to a net increase in greenhouse gas emissions, at least in the short term.
Then there is the issue of scale.
In order for BECCS to achieve emissions limits set by the Paris agreement, between 430 million and 580 million hectares (1.1 billion to 1.4 billion acres) of land would be needed to grow the required vegetation.
That is a staggering one third of the world’s arable land.
Simply put, there are safer – and proven – ways to withdraw CO2 from the atmosphere.
Rather than creating artificial CO2-binding “farms,” governments should focus on protecting already-existing natural ecosystems and allowing degraded ones to recover.
Rainforests, oceans, and peatlands (such as bogs) have immense CO2 storage capacities and do not require untested technological manipulation.
By pushing unproven technologies as a cure for all climate-changing ills, proponents are suggesting that the world faces an unavoidable choice: geoengineering or disaster.
But this is disingenuous.
Political preferences, not scientific or ecological necessity, explain the appeal of geoengineering.
Unfortunately, current debates about climate engineering are undemocratic and dominated by technocratic worldviews, natural science and engineering perspectives, and vested interests in the fossil-fuel industries.
Developing countries, indigenous peoples, and local communities must be given a prominent voice, so that all risks can be fully considered before any geoengineering technology is tested or implemented.
So what conversation should we be having about geoengineering?
For starters, we need to rethink the existing governance landscape.
In 2010, parties to the United Nations’ Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) agreed to a de facto international moratorium on climate-related geoengineering.
But today, with powerful advocates generating so much pressure to bring geoengineering technologies out of the lab, informal bans are no longer sufficient.
The world urgently needs an honest debate on the research, deployment, and governance of these technologies; the CBD and the London Protocol are essential starting points for these governance discussions.
Among the technologies that require the most scrutiny are CDR projects that threaten indigenous lands, food security, and water availability.
Such large-scale technological schemes must be regulated diligently, to ensure that climate-change solutions do not adversely affect sustainable development or human rights.
In addition, the outdoor testing and deployment of SRM technologies, because of their potential to weaken human rights, democracy, and international peace, should be banned outright.
This ban should be overseen by a robust and accountable multilateral global governance mechanism.
No silver bullet for climate change has yet been found.
And while geoengineering technologies remain mostly aspirational, there are proven mitigation options that can and should be implemented vigorously.
These include scaling up renewable energy, phasing out fossil fuels (including an early retirement of existing fossil infrastructure), wider diffusion of sustainable agroecological agriculture, and decreased energy and resource input into our economy.
We cannot afford to gamble with the future of our planet.
If we engage in a serious discussion about ecologically sustainable and socially just measures to protect the Earth’s climate, there will be no need to roll the dice on geoengineering.
The Meaty Side of Climate Change
BERLIN – Last year, three of the world’s largest meat companies – JBS, Cargill, and Tyson Foods – emitted more greenhouse gases than France, and nearly as much as some big oil companies.
And yet, while energy giants like Exxon and Shell have drawn fire for their role in fueling climate change, the corporate meat and dairy industries have largely avoided scrutiny.
If we are to avert environmental disaster, this double standard must change.
To bring attention to this issue, the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy, GRAIN, and Germany’s Heinrich Böll Foundation recently teamed up to study the “supersized climate footprint” of the global livestock trade.
What we found was shocking.
In 2016, the world’s 20 largest meat and dairy companies emitted more greenhouse gases than Germany.
If these companies were a country, they would be the world’s seventh-largest emitter.
Obviously, mitigating climate change will require tackling emissions from the meat and dairy industries.
The question is how.
Around the world, meat and dairy companies have become politically powerful entities.
The recent corruption-related arrests of two JBS executives, the brothers Joesley and Wesley Batista, pulled back the curtain on corruption in the industry.
JBS is the largest meat processor in the world, earning nearly $20 billion more in 2016 than its closest rival, Tyson Foods.
But JBS achieved its position with assistance from the Brazilian Development Bank, and apparently, by bribing more than 1,800 politicians.
It is no wonder, then, that greenhouse-gas emissions are low on the company’s list of priorities.
In 2016, JBS, Tyson and Cargill emitted 484 million tons of climate-changing gases, 46 million tons more than BP, the British energy giant.
Meat and dairy industry insiders push hard for pro-production policies, often at the expense of environmental and public health.
From seeking to block reductions in nitrous oxide and methane emissions, to circumventing obligations to reduce air, water, and soil pollution, they have managed to increase profits while dumping pollution costs on the public.
One consequence, among many, is that livestock production now accounts for nearly 15% of global greenhouse-gas emissions.
That is a bigger share than the world’s entire transportation sector.
Moreover, much of the growth in meat and dairy production in the coming decades is expected to come from the industrial model.
If this growth conforms to the pace projected by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization, our ability to keep temperatures from rising to apocalyptic levels will be severely undermined.
At the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP23) in Bonn, Germany, last month, several UN agencies were directed, for the first time ever, to cooperate on issues related to agriculture, including livestock management.
This move is welcome for many reasons, but especially because it will begin to expose the conflicts of interest that are endemic in the global agribusiness trade.
To skirt climate responsibility, the meat and dairy industries have long argued that expanding production is necessary for food security.
Corporate firms, they insist, can produce meat or milk more efficiently than a pastoralist in the Horn of Africa or a small-scale producer in India.
Unfortunately, current climate policies do not refute this narrative, and some even encourage increased production and intensification.
Rather than setting targets for the reduction of total industry-related emissions, many current policies create incentives for firms to squeeze more milk from each dairy cow and bring beef cattle to slaughter faster.
This necessitates equating animals to machinery that can be tweaked to produce more with less through technological fixes, and ignoring all of this model other negative effects.
California’s experience is instructive.
Pursuing one of the world’s first efforts to regulate agricultural methane, the state government has set ambitious targets to reduce emissions in cattle processing.
But California is currently addressing the issue by financing programs that support mega-dairies, rather than small, sustainable operators.
Such “solutions” have only worsened the industry’s already-poor record on worker and animal welfare, and exacerbated adverse environmental and health-related effects.
Solutions do exist.
For starters, governments could redirect public money from factory farming and large-scale agribusiness to smaller, ecologically focused family farms.
Governments could also use procurement policies to help build markets for local products and encourage cleaner, more vibrant farm economies.
Many cities around the world are already basing their energy choices on a desire to tackle climate change.
Similar criteria could shape municipalities’ food policies, too.
For example, higher investment in farm-to-hospital and farm-to-school programs would ensure healthier diets for residents, strengthen local economies, and reduce the climate impact of the meat and dairy industries.
Dairy and meat giants have operated with climate impunity for far too long.
If we are to halt global temperature spikes and avert an ecological crisis, consumers and governments must do more to create, support, and strengthen environmentally conscious producers.
That would be good for our health – and for the health of our planet.
Weathering the Violence of Climate Change
SANTA MONICA – With India experiencing its worst drought in 140 years, Indian farmers have taken to the streets.
At a protest in Madhya Pradesh this summer, police opened fire on farmers demanding debt relief and better crop prices, killing five.
In Tamil Nadu, angry growers have held similar protests, and lit candles in remembrance of those killed.
And at one rally in New Delhi, farmers carried human skulls, which they say belonged to farmers who have committed suicide following devastating crop losses over the past six months.
According to a recent study by Tamma A. Carleton of the University of California, Berkeley, suicides among Indian farmers have increased with the temperature, such that an increase of 1º Celsius above the average temperature on a given day is associated with approximately 70 additional suicides, on average.
Beyond exposing failed farming policies, this year’s drought-fueled turmoil also underscores the threat that climate change poses not just to India, but to all countries.
As global temperatures rise and droughts become more common, political agitation, social unrest, and even violence will likely follow.
In 2008, when severe weather cut into the world’s grain supply and drove up food prices, countries ranging from Morocco to Indonesia experienced social and political upheavals.
More recently, food insecurity has been used as a weapon in the wars in Yemen and Syria.
According to the Center for Climate and Security, failure to address such “climate-driven risks” could lead to increased fighting over water, food, energy, and land, particularly in already unstable regions.
CCS identifies 12 “epicenters” where climate change might ignite or exacerbate conflicts that could engulf large populations, and spill across national borders.
It is no coincidence that conflicts proliferate alongside rising temperatures.
A 2013 study estimates that interpersonal violence rises by 4%, and intergroup conflicts by 14%, “for each one standard deviation change in climate toward warmer temperatures or more extreme rainfall.”
Moreover, psychological studies have shown that when people are subjected to uncomfortably hot temperatures, they show increased levels of aggression.
And new research is finding that what is true for the individual also holds true for populations.
In Sub-Saharan Africa, researchers have found a strong correlation between three decades of rising temperatures and outbreaks of civil war.
If warming trends continue, civil wars and other conflicts will become more common in Africa, the South China Sea, the Arctic, Central America, and elsewhere.
Avoiding such outcomes will require renewed support for multilateral treaties such as the 2015 Paris climate agreement, which has been weakened by the withdrawal of the United States.
But it will also require increased engagement by countries, cities, and industries on three key areas: resource management, disaster mitigation, and migration.
In largely agricultural societies, farm productivity affects the entire economy.
As we’ve seen in the Horn of Africa and India this year, changes in temperature and rainfall can reduce crop yields, and thus rural incomes.
Under such conditions, and in the absence of other economic opportunities, communities may resort to violence as they compete for food and scarce resources.
International aid organizations, working with state and federal governments, should go beyond addressing the immediate causes of poverty to also develop long-term strategies for helping agricultural communities survive bad harvests.
Such strategies should focus on arable-land management and water conservation, among other areas.
Additionally, new strategies are needed to coordinate disaster-relief efforts.
As the climate changes, weather-related calamities such as floods, hurricanes, landslides, and typhoons will increase in frequency, intensity, and duration, undermining individual livelihoods and the broader economy.
Governments must work together to mitigate these risks, and to respond forcefully to disasters when they happen.
Otherwise, the fallout will disproportionately hurt poor and vulnerable communities, perpetuating the cycle of poverty and violence.
Finally, we need better policies for managing human migration, much of it related to severe weather and droughts.
In 2015, the number of international migrants reached a record high of 244 million.
As the climate shifts, entire regions could become uninhabitable, and many more people will be uprooted.
Parts of the Middle East, for example, could become too hot for humans by the end of this century; and heavily populated cities such as New Delhi could experience temperatures over 95º Fahrenheit (35º C) up to 200 days out of the year.
The International Organization for Migration fears that as more people flee the heat, the concentration of humanity into smaller spaces will have an unprecedented impact on local “coping capacity.”
Scientists agree that climate change poses a grave danger to the planet.
But for some reason, politicians and government officials have not connected the dots between a changing climate and human conflicts.
Among the many threats associated with climate change, deteriorating global security may be the most frightening of all.
It is bad enough to see farmers carrying skulls through the streets of India.
But if we do not get serious about climate-driven security risks, we could see far worse.
Is Global Warming Making Us Hungrier?
PRAGUE – For more than a decade, annual data showed global hunger to be on the decline.
But that has changed: According to the latest data from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) hunger affected 815 million people in 2016, 38 million more than 2015, and malnutrition is threatening millions.
Research from my think tank, Copenhagen Consensus, has long helped to focus attention and resources on the most effective responses to malnutrition, both globally and in countries like Haiti and Bangladesh.
Unfortunately, there are worrying signs that the global response may be headed in the wrong direction.
The FAO blames the rise in hunger on a proliferation of violent conflicts and “climate-related shocks,” which means specific, extreme events like floods and droughts.
But in the FAO’s press release, “climate-related shocks” becomes “climate change.”
The report itself links the two without citing evidence, but the FAO’s communiqué goes further, declaring starkly, “World hunger again on the rise, driven by conflict and climate change.”
It may seem like a tiny step to go from blaming “climate-related shocks” to blaming “climate change.”
Both terms relate to the weather.
But that little difference means a lot, especially when it comes to the most important question: how do we help feed the world better?
Jumping the gun and blaming climate change for today’s crises attracts attention, but it makes us focus on the costliest and least effective responses.
The best evidence comes from the United Nations’ climate change panel, the IPCC, which has clearly shown that there has been no overall increase in droughts.
While some parts of the world are experiencing more and worse droughts, others are experiencing fewer and lighter droughts.
A comprehensive study in the journal Nature demonstrates that, since 1982, incidents of all categories of drought, from “abnormally dry” to “exceptional drought,” have decreased slightly.
On flooding, the IPCC is even blunter: It has “low confidence” at a global level whether climate change has caused more or less flooding.
What the IPCC tells us is that by the end of the century, it is likely that worse droughts will affect some parts of the world.
And it predicts – albeit with low confidence – that there could be more floods in some places.
Relying on climate policies to fight hunger is doomed.
Any realistic carbon cuts will be expensive and have virtually no impact on climate by the end of the century.
The Paris climate agreement, even if fully implemented up to 2030, would achieve just 1% of the cuts needed to keep temperature from rising more than 2oC, according to the UN.
And it would cost $1 trillion a year or more – an incredibly expensive way to make no meaningful difference to a potential increase in flooding and droughts at the end of the century.
In fact, well-intentioned policies to combat global warming could very well be exacerbatinghunger.
Rich countries have embraced biofuels – energy derived from plants – to reduce their reliance on fossil fuels.
But the climate benefit is negligible: according to the International Institute for Sustainable Development, deforestation, fertilizer, and fossil fuels used in producing biofuels offset about 90% of the “saved” carbon dioxide.
In 2013, European biofuels used enough land to feed 100 million people, and the United States’ program even more.
Biofuel subsidies contributed to rising food prices, and their swift growth was reined in only when models showed that up to another 135 million people could starve by 2020.
But that means that the hunger of around 30 million people today can likely be attributed to these bad policies.
Moreover, climate policies divert resources from measures that directly reduce hunger.
Our priorities seem skewed when climate policies promising a miniscule temperature impact will cost $1 trillion a year, while the World Food Program’s budget is 169 times lower, at $5.9 billion.
There are effective ways to produce more food.
One of the best, as Copenhagen Consensus research has shown, is to get serious about investing in research and development to boost agricultural productivity.
Through irrigation, fertilizer, pesticides, and plant breeding, the Green Revolution increased world grain production by an astonishing 250% between 1950 and 1984, raising the calorie intake of the world’s poorest people and averting severe famines.
We need to build on this progress.
Investing an extra $88 billion in agricultural R&D over the next 32 years would increase yields by an additional 0.4 percentage points every year, which could save 79 million people from hunger and prevent five million cases of child malnourishment.
This would be worth nearly $3 trillion in social good, implying an enormous return of $34 for every dollar spent.
By the end of the century, the extra increase in agricultural productivity would be far greater than the damage to agricultural productivity suggested by even the worst-case scenarios of the effects of global warming.
And there would be additional benefits: the World Bank has found that productivity growth in agriculture can be up to four times more effective in reducing poverty than productivity growth in other sectors.
We are at a turning point.
After achieving dramatic gains against hunger and famine, we run the risk of backsliding, owing to poorly considered choices.
The stakes are far too high for us to pick the wrong policies.
When Climate Leaders Protect Dirty Investments
GENEVA – Solutions to the climate crisis are often associated with big conferences, and the next two weeks will no doubt bring many “answers.”
Some 20,000 delegates have now descended on Bonn, Germany, for the latest round of United Nations climate change talks.
The talks in Bonn should focus on the implementation of the Paris climate agreement.
And the path forward is clear.
The only way to keep the rise in global temperatures within the limit set in Paris – “well below 2°C” higher than pre-industrial levels – is to shift capital away from fossil fuels and toward zero-carbon projects.
To do that, we must change how global energy investments are governed.
At the moment, the very governments leading the fight against climate change continue to support and protect investment in fossil-fuel exploration, extraction, and transportation.
Rather than investing in efficient housing, zero-carbon mobility, renewable energy, and better land-use systems, these governments say one thing but still do another.
According to the most recent World Energy Investment report from the International Energy Agency, global expenditure in the oil and gas sector totaled $649 billion in 2016.
That was more than double the $297 billion invested in renewable electricity generation, even though achieving the Paris agreement’s target implies leaving at least three quarters of known fossil-fuel reserves in the ground.
As these numbers suggest, institutional inertia and entrenched industry interests continue to stand in the way of shifting investment into sustainable energy.
Much of the problem can be traced to bilateral investment treaties and investment rules embedded within broader trade pacts, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), the Energy Charter Treaty, and the EU-Canada Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA).
Because these treaties were designed to shield foreign investors from expropriation, they include investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) mechanisms that allow investors to seek compensation from governments, via international arbitration tribunals, if policy changes affect their business.
This has handcuffed governments seeking to limit fossil-fuel extraction.
Compensation from ISDS cases can be staggering.
In 2012, an American investor filed a lawsuit against the Quebec government’s decision to deny a permit for hydraulic fracturing under the Saint Lawrence River.
Arguing that the denial was “arbitrary, capricious, and illegal” under NAFTA, the Delaware-based energy firm sought $250 million in damages.
In January 2016, the TransCanada energy company used NAFTA to sue the United States, claiming $15 billion in losses after President Barack Obama denied a permit for the Keystone XL oil pipeline.
(The company suspended its suit after President Donald Trump approved the project in January 2017).
And in July 2017, Quebec agreed to pay nearly $50 million in compensation to companies after canceling oil and gas exploration contracts on Anticosti Island in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence.
These and other payments are in addition to the hundreds of billions of dollars in subsidies that continue to flow to the fossil-fuel industry.
Big payouts do more than drain public coffers; the mere threat of them discourages governments from pursuing more ambitious climate policies, owing to fear that carbon-dependent industries could challenge them in international tribunals.
Fortunately, this state of affairs is not set in stone.
Many governments now see reform of the investment regime not just as a possibility, but as a necessity.
Last month, the UN Conference on Trade and Development convened a high-level meeting in Geneva, with the goal of developing options for comprehensive reform of the investment regime, including the renegotiation or termination of some 3,000 outdated treaties.
Governments should start by overhauling or exiting the Energy Charter Treaty, the world’s only energy-specific investment pact.
The ECT’s investment protections and lack of climate provisions are no longer appropriate.
Since its inception, the ECT has served as the basis for more than 100 claims by energy firms against host countries, with some challenging national environmental policies, such as the nuclear phase-out in Germany.
Russia and Italy have already withdrawn from the ECT; other countries should do the same or commit to renegotiating it.
Moreover, countries should put climate concerns at the center of their trade and investment negotiations, such as by carving out fossil-fuel projects from investment clauses.
That is essentially what France recently proposed, when ecology minister Nicolas Hulot announced his country’s intention to enact a “climate veto” to CETA.
Hulot said France would ratify the treaty only if it contained assurances that its climate commitments could not be challenged before arbitration tribunals.
Fossil-fuel projects could also be exempted from investment protection in new environmental treaties, such as the Global Pact for the Environment presented by French President Emmanuel Macron to the UN General Assembly in September.
Rebalancing the global investment regime is only the first step toward a zero-carbon economy.
To shift capital from fossil-fuel heavy initiatives to green energy projects, countries will need new legal and policy frameworks at the regional, national, and international levels.
These agreements should promote and facilitate zero-carbon investments.
Big meetings like the one getting underway this week and the Paris Climate Summit next month can kick-start these conversations.

Closing the Education Gender Gap
WASHINGTON, DC – Completing primary school in Niger was never a certainty for Aishetu Mahmoudu Hama, given all the obstacles that stood in her way.
“It was hard to study,” she recalls.
“We sat on the ground – sometimes on a mat, sometimes just in the dirt.”
But Aishetu persevered, and she is now a 23-year-old university student.
Aishetu knows that without school, her life chances would likely be confined to herding, farming, getting married, and having a lot of children.
There simply would be no other opportunities for her to pursue.
Like the female teachers who inspired her to learn, Aishetu wants to be a role model to younger girls and her own siblings.
She hopes that her story will motivate them to complete their education, too.
On this International Day of the Girl, Aishetu stands as proof of the difference that education can make for girls and the people around them.
But the struggles that Aishetu overcame also remind us that education remains beyond reach for far too many girls.
Consider one appalling statistic: The number of girls not attending school, despite having fallen by 40% since 2000, still stands at 130 million.
This helps to explain why women struggle more than men to find meaningful, well-paying work, and why the share of women in the global workforce persistently lags behind that of men.
Making matters worse, even where girls’ educational attainment has grown rapidly, commensurate improvements for women in the workforce have remained elusive.
According to a 2015 study by the World Economic Forum, “while more women than men are enrolling at university in 97 countries, women make up the majority of skilled workers in only 68 countries and the majority of leaders in only four.”
These gender gaps represent a major generational challenge for large and small businesses alike.
Worldwide, companies are already struggling to find enough qualified workers for their increasingly automated work processes.
The International Commission for Financing Global Education Opportunity reported last year that nearly 40% of employers are having difficulties recruiting workers with the right skills.
Businesses investing in lower-income countries also need their workers to be healthy.
This is more likely when mothers are educated: they and their families tend to be healthier than in the case of less educated mothers.
In fact, research shows that if all childbearing-age women were to complete secondary education, the number of children dying before age five would drop by about 350,000 each year.
The businesses investing in developing- and emerging-market countries that are home to most out-of-school girls thus have an interest in helping girls get the education they deserve.
If educational outcomes improve, we will likely see far more women pursuing the higher-level technical training that today’s workplaces are demanding.
To put 130 million additional girls into school, we will have to overcome an array of stubborn barriers.
In many countries, educating girls is not considered important, owing to expectations that they will work exclusively at home or on the family farm.
Early marriage, sexual assault, a lack of sanitary facilities for menstruating girls, and humanitarian crises are just some of the factors that make completing an education more difficult for girls than for boys.
And in remote areas in particular, school fees and arduous commutes pose further challenges.
Even if these cultural, political, and geographic hurdles can be cleared, wealthier countries will need to commit far more resources to educating girls in developing economies than they have in the past.
Shockingly, the share of donor countries’ overseas development aid that is allocated for education has shrunk over the last six years, and is now smaller than it was in 2010.
Donor countries urgently need to reverse that trend.
The Global Partnership for Education has been one of the leading catalysts in educating girls over the past decade and a half.
Thanks to GPE funding, an additional 38 million girls in developing countries were enrolled in primary school from 2002 to 2014.
To build on that progress, GPE will hold a financing conference, co-hosted by the Senegalese and French governments, on February 8, 2018, in Dakar.
We are appealing to donors around the world to help us reach $2 billion in annual funds by 2020.
With sufficient funding, GPE can support the education needs of 870 million children in more than 80 countries.
And it can help developing countries build education systems that will give girls like Aishetu the chance to realize their potential.
When girls and women are empowered through education, they can and do transform the world for the better.
Investment in their potential is a bet that can’t lose.
A Long Way from Comey to Watergate
PRINCETON – President Donald J. Trump’s firing of FBI Director James Comey is unprecedented, as is much of what Trump has undertaken as president.
Despite similarities with President Richard M. Nixon’s infamous “Saturday Night Massacre” 44 years ago, during the Watergate scandal, the political situations are utterly different.
In October 1973, Nixon, waiting until a weekend, ordered the dismissal of a newly appointed special prosecutor, Archibald Cox, who had issued a subpoena demanding that Nixon hand over secretly recorded – and, as would become clear, highly damning – White House tapes.
Nixon’s defiance was direct, and the result was disastrous.
Attorney General Elliot Richardson and Deputy Attorney General William Ruckelshaus resigned in protest rather than carry out the president’s order.
A federal judge ruled the firing of Cox illegal.
Public opinion polls showed, for the first time, a plurality of Americans favoring Nixon’s impeachment.
It was the beginning of the end.
Congressmen introduced impeachment resolutions.
Nixon was forced to appoint a new special prosecutor.
The drama thickened for another ten months, until the Supreme Court unanimously ordered Nixon to surrender the tapes.
A few days after that, Nixon resigned rather than face certain impeachment and removal from office.
By contrast, unless the stars realign, Trump’s firing of Comey may mark the beginning of nothing, or at least of nothing bad for the president.
Trump, like Nixon, may well be guilty of grave impeachable offenses – even graver offenses than Nixon’s.
Trump, like Nixon, may have feared that unless he fired the person in charge of investigating him, some terrible revelation would be forthcoming.
But, even if all this is so, Trump, unlike Nixon, may very well get away with it.
The two events differ in many ways, including their timing.
By the time Nixon fired Cox, the Watergate affair had been building for far longer than the allegations about Trump and Russia have, so nerves had been rubbed raw.
The main differences, though, are political.
In Nixon’s time, there were solid adversarial Democratic majorities in both houses of Congress, and there were also some Republicans, especially in the Senate, who put concerns about the Constitution ahead of concerns for their party.
The Senate appointed a special select committee, headed by Democrat Sam Ervin and Republican Howard Baker, which heard testimony and gathered official evidence that led to the indictment of 40 administration officials and the conviction of several top White House aides, as well as to Nixon’s resignation.
Today’s Republican congressional majorities, however, have seemed singularly devoted to slowing and narrowing any serious inquiry into the thoroughly substantiated reports of Russian efforts to throw the 2016 election to Trump.
Although there has been talk, even from some Republicans, about appointing a select committee or a special prosecutor to look into the allegations about the Russians and the Trump campaign, the resistance has been extraordinary compared to 1973.
Based on the events of the last week, Republicans evidently would rather rail against insider leaks and, yes, Hillary Clinton’s email server than inquire into the White House’s insouciance about former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn’s alarming links to Russia and Turkey.
Without a significant shift, the congressional investigations will continue to remain confined to the standing House and Senate committees, where they will likely remain understaffed and under-motivated.
Then there is the press.
In 1973, dogged reporting by Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward of the Washington Post kept the Watergate story alive, after most news outlets had dropped it.
Once their reporting gained traction, the rest of the press picked up the scandal and kept up the pressure on the Nixon White House.
Today, Trump can count on the fervent support of propaganda operations that Nixon could only have prayed for, including the unabashedly polemical Fox News and Breitbart News, as well as the countless bloggers (and, for that matter, Russian-controlled cyberbots) pumping out pro-Trump propaganda.
As I write this, one Fox commentator after another is parroting the White House’s absurd claim that Trump fired Comey because of the terrible things the FBI director did to Clinton during the campaign.
One almost expects the network’s biggest star, Sean Hannity, to start leading on-air anti-Comey chants of “Lock Him Up!”
The effect on anyone who recalls Trump’s cheerleading for Comey last October – followed by the red-hatted crowds’ ritualistic baying to jail crooked Hillary – is psychedelic.
But fans of Fox News usually believe what the channel reports.
And while Nixon had Fox News' future Svengali, a young Roger Ailes, behind him, Fox and the rest were still two decades away.
It is possible, of course, that Trump’s firing of Comey will push some Republicans to decide that enough is enough and follow Baker’s example.
The early responses have been mixed: although Republican Senators Jeff Flake, John McCain, and Ben Sasse have expressed varying degrees of disappointment, normally independent-minded Senators Susan Collins and Lindsey Graham have backed Trump’s decision.
There is always a chance, in such a volatile climate, that deals will be broken, witnesses will flip, and facts will emerge that are every bit as incriminating as the evidence that felled Nixon.
International developments might also awaken some Republicans to the magnitude of the Russian offensive on Western democracies, an offensive which, in the wake of the French elections, feels like an undeclared war.
For the moment, though, there is no reason to see Trump’s firing of Comey as a re-run of Nixon’s “Saturday Night Massacre,” or any other event in American political history.
The president may be acting as if he has something terrible to hide, just as Nixon did, but that won’t be enough under the circumstances to cause the exposure of whatever it may be.
Ironically, Trump, the self-declared outsider who lost the popular vote and squeaked into office by winning the Electoral College, finds himself, for the moment, in some ways more protected than the party man Nixon, who won the 1972 election by overwhelming popular as well as electoral margins.
It may be unsettling to acknowledge, but history is not repeating itself, no matter how tragic or farcical things might appear.
Trump may yet fall, but a lot will have to change.
Building a Gender-Inclusive Workplace
NEW YORK – The wave of high-profile sexual harassment cases that began with revelations from Hollywood is having a profound impact on far less glamorous work environments.
Just as major film studios have been forced to take action against abuse, a similar revolution – powered by the #MeToo movement of women speaking out – is sweeping workplaces everywhere.
It has been terrible to learn of the abuse that women suffered at the hands of powerful men like Harvey Weinstein, Matt Lauer, and Al Franken.
But it is also deeply encouraging to see the corporate world take this issue seriously, by attempting to create a “shared future” for their female employees.
The collective response to the #MeToo movement could mark a turning point in the way employers think about sexual harassment and other issues involving gender – like pay and power.
But the workplace revolution is far from over.
New strategies are needed to encourage healthy interactions among employees.
When handled properly, gender equality promotes business output and productivity, whereas sexual discrimination, if ignored, can destroy an office culture – and so much more.
Companies have traditionally taken a box-ticking approach to addressing harassment, using written policies and trainings in a feeble bid to encourage respect.
But this top-down approach has proven ineffective, as scandals at Uber and other tech firms have demonstrated.
If workplace abuse is to be curtailed, business leaders and C-Suite executives need a fresh approach.
The first priority is to achieve gender balance at the top.
Diversity in leadership encourages employee cooperation and leads to healthier organizations.
This is not a new idea; a 2016 study published in the Harvard Business Review found that companies with more high-level female executives generate higher profits.
Other studies have shown that women perform better under stress, often making smarter decisions.
But, despite the obvious benefits that women bring, they remain under-represented in senior leadership positions at companies around the world.
Change is needed in the digital workplace as well.
Predators may lurk around the water cooler, but they are also active in online communities, chat rooms, and forums.
Concerns raised by the #MeToo movement spread virally on social media within hours, and similar anger could engulf an organization at any time.
Companies must therefore place a premium on promoting online decorum, and take seriously any comments and concerns expressed by their employees.
Most companies already monitor social media for reputational risks and customer satisfaction; they should do the same to protect their staff.
Finally, companies must be responsive to the concerns of their youngest employees, who will inherit the office of the future.
With more millennials entering the workforce and demanding greater equality, the youngest employees already have a stronger voice at work than previous generations.
A recent Boston Consulting Group study found that young male employees are often more open-minded than their superiors on issues like family leave and diversity, suggesting that true leadership on gender equality may actually come from a company’s youngest staff members.
Moreover, researchers at Rutgers University have shown that more than 50% of millennials would consider a pay cut if it meant working for a company that shared their values, while the Society for Human Resource Management notes that 94% of young workers want to use their skills to benefit a good cause.
Rather than resist these trends, companies should look to harness the benevolence of their youngest talent.
To build a more inclusive workplace, management must craft narratives that support the changes their employees are demanding.
Most important, employees need role models.
The willingness of celebrities like Salma Hayek, Rose McGowan, and Reese Witherspoon to share their stories of sexual harassment empowered women from many walks of life to speak out, too.
Changing workplace culture will demand similarly strong leadership.
That shift is on the horizon, and I am inspired by the women and men who are calling on future generations to work together more equitably.
It is easy to feel overwhelmed by the complexity of these issues, but if managers and employees can commit to building purpose-driven and inclusive work environments, change is inevitable.
The women of Hollywood may have initiated what has become a global call for equality at work, but the workplace revolution is no less significant for those of us who walk on less colorful carpets.
The Complexity of Inequality
MUNICH – Since 2013, when Thomas Piketty published his much-discussed study of the distribution of income and wealth, inequality has been at the forefront of public debate in most advanced economies, blamed for everything from slow growth and stagnating productivity to the rise of populism and the Brexit vote.
But inequality remains poorly defined, its effects highly variable, and its causes hotly debated.
Even the most basic question – how much inequality is too much – is virtually impossible to answer.
There is no “natural rate of inequality” characterizing an economy in equilibrium, a level at which policymakers can aim.
Instead, countries’ rates of inequality are measured against one another – a narrow approach that ignores everything from broader economic trends to differences in the impact of wealth inequality on populations in different social environments.
At a time when everyone seems to be complaining about inequality, wealth is, at the global level, more broadly distributed than ever.
In the last 16 years alone, the number of people who qualify for inclusion in the global middle class – at today’s level, people with net financial assets of €7,000-42,000 ($7,400-$44,600) – has more than doubled, to over one billion, or about 20% of the world population.
And it is not just the middle class that is growing.
At the end of last year, around 540 million people around the world could count themselves among the global wealthy, with net assets above €42,000.
That is some 100 million, or 25%, more than in 2000.
The key to this progress has been the success of the emerging economies, especially China.
And, indeed, many of those who have joined the high-wealth group are not from the traditional “rich” countries; on the contrary, the United States, Japan, and Western Europe now have just 66% of the world’s high-wealth households, compared with over 90% in 2000.
On the national level, inequality is rising, but only in some places.
In the emerging economies, the share of wealth owned by the middle class is increasing, indicating a drop in wealth inequality.
It is primarily in the industrialized world that inequality is on the rise, with the share of wealth held by the top 10% growing the most.
This discrepancy may be explained partly by the fact that the global financial crisis was most painful for the advanced countries, especially in Europe.
But the expansionary monetary policies that advanced-country central banks pursued after the crisis made a bad situation worse.
Those policies pushed up prices of assets – especially bonds and equities – that were held largely by wealthy households.
At the same time, they hurt middle-class savers, who typically rely on duller savings instruments like bank deposits.
With zero or, later, negative interest rates, those savers lost out.
Though median households are generally benefiting from lower borrowing costs, wealthier households are benefiting much more, thanks in part to savings on mortgage loans, which are highest relative to income for the upper middle class.
But the impact of ultra-loose monetary policy extends far beyond today’s wealth and income effects.
With advanced-country populations aging rapidly, saving for old age is more important than ever.
With very low interest rates reducing the rate of accumulation of pension assets, all but the wealthiest households will probably have to boost savings and/or reduce consumption, now and in the future.
The decline in lifetime spending will ultimately have a negative impact on growth and potentially generate social fault lines for the coming generations.
Complicating the inequality narrative further are differences across individual economies, including among those that, technically, have similar levels of inequality. Consider the disparities between the US, Denmark, and Sweden – all three of which are among the world’s most unequal societies, with respect to the distribution of wealth.
Denmark and Sweden are known for their well-developed social-welfare systems, free education, and high labor-market participation.
Moreover, Denmark took the top spot in the United Nations’ World Happiness report last year, suggesting that wealth inequality does not trouble Danes too much.
By contrast, in the US, which lacks many of the social protections provided by its northern European counterparts, inequality is very troubling indeed.
The increase in wealth inequality there over the last decade has been the most pronounced of any country.
Today, the US has the smallest middle class, holding just 22% of total net financial assets, half the average of other industrialized countries, and the highest concentration of wealth than in any other country.
As in Europe or Japan, the financial crisis and subsequent monetary policy might be a major cause for this development.
However, another factor could also be the digital revolution which, at least for the main protagonists, is increasingly turning out to be a “wealth catalyst”.
In any case, it is important to recognize that America’s situation is extraordinary.
It does not represent the state of Western capitalism.
It is the exception, not the rule.
All of this has important implications for how to tackle inequality.
Simply put, if the causes and impacts of inequality differ across countries, so should the policy prescriptions.
For some countries, such as in southern Europe, tackling unemployment is critical to enable middle- and lower-income households to save and consume.
Other countries should focus on improving the conditions for long-term savings, such as through occupational pension schemes.
Still others would do well to reduce the tax burden, in particular for low- and middle-wage earners.
There is, however, one policy prescription that would benefit many of the countries with the highest levels of inequality.
Central banks must bring down the curtain on zero and, especially, negative interest rates.
Doing so would certainly be a good start to combating rising wealth inequality.
Comrade Trump and the Truth
OXFORD – When US President-elect Donald Trump takes office later this month, Americans will be more divided than they have been in years.
Never before has an American presidential inauguration been met with so many hosannas from the United States’ oldest foe, Russia, and with such nervous anguish from its closest allies.
And never before has a US president been elected with such a popular-vote deficit: 2.8 million and counting.
The leader of a government that is supposed to be of, by, and for the people has been elected by a clear minority of those people.
It is fitting that only the Kremlin shares this idea of democracy.
Of course, educated observers know that US presidential elections are not decided by the popular vote, but by the Electoral College.
The Founding Fathers created this system as a compromise between the popular vote and a vote by Congress, to balance the influence of each state.
Alexander Hamilton reckoned that the Electoral College would prevent unqualified candidates with “talents for low intrigue, and the little arts of popularity” from being elected.
This rather confirms my view that the men who drafted the US Constitution had a sense of irony.
When Trump brags that he won by a landslide, he is engaging in his characteristic “truthiness.”
He won the crucial Democratic firewall states of Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania by only 107,000 votes – 0.09% of all votes cast across the country.
This election was not a landslide; it was a little sand blown into the great engine of American democracy by the promise to make Russia – sorry, America – “great again.”
Apparently, making America great again means pledging to remove elitist crooks from government, and then stuffing your cabinet with billionaires and Goldman Sachs alumni.
It means spurring economic growth, and then imposing a 35% tariff on imports.
And it means, among other things, promising to restore steelworkers’ and miners’ jobs, end the cosseting of minorities, deport all undocumented migrants, cut taxes and increase infrastructure spending by hundreds of billions of dollars, repeal Obamacare, eliminate or somehow renegotiate the national debt, torture militants, and target their families.
Come next year, everyone in Washington, DC, had better be nice to Trump, lest they be subjected to nasty tweets, hate mail, and online attacks.
And woe betide anyone who suggests that Russia’s malign interference in the election has anything to do with Trump’s own warmth toward Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Never mind that the CIA and FBI have concluded that Russia hacked both Democrats and Republicans, but only leaked Democrats’ emails; or that US President Barack Obama has now responded with a report detailing Russia’s involvement and sanctions against Russian intelligence agencies.
The inquiries into these weighty matters will continue after Trump’s inauguration, and you can bet that they will multiply, as leaks flood out of Washington.
Some of these may be false flags or bits of speculation, but others may be true, and possibly horrifying.
Either way, they will all be divisive, and they will weaken the US and its president.
Still, Trump will weather the storm, unless investigators can confirm complicity between his campaign and any Russian entity known to be connected to Putin.
One can only guess what the prize would be for finding such a treacherous link.
This will all be very messy, but we should perhaps be grateful that the shoe is not on the other foot.
Imagine that Trump had won the popular vote by a wide margin, but suffered a narrow defeat in the Electoral College.
Imagine if this happened alongside CIA reports that Russian intelligence agencies had hacked and leaked Trump’s campaign emails to put him at a disadvantage.
And imagine that Hillary Clinton was packing her cabinet with billionaires.
What would Trump be doing?
He would likely rally his supporters, who have been led to believe that Clinton and her husband are corrupt murderers.
Indeed, if the tables were turned, there would be ample cause to worry for the future of the US – a country that I love and have long admired.
So, what can we do in the dark days ahead?
For starters, we must not allow lies to crowd out the truth in public discourse and debate.
If social media are full of falsehoods, counter them with facts.
If co-workers are repeating fake-news headlines or ignorant, prejudiced claims, challenge them on it.
If television or radio news programs are distorting the truth, pick up the phone and tell them and their advertisers what you think.
And ask your pastors and other community leaders to roll up their sleeves and do the same.
Each of us, as citizens, must campaign for truth and against prejudice and humbug, because if we lose the truth, democracy will be next.
As Saint Augustine supposedly said, “The truth is like a lion; you don’t have to defend it.
Let it loose, and it will defend itself.”
In 2017, we must open the lion’s cage.
Consolidating Latin America’s Gains
SANTIAGO – At the time of last year’s failed coup in Turkey, I emailed a Turkish friend expressing concern.
His answer left me thinking.
After a somber review of events in his country, he concluded: “You are very lucky to be in Latin America, even though it may not seem that way sometimes.”
We Latin Americans are complainers.
We shudder to think that other people’s lot could be worse than ours.
But if a Latin American views today’s world objectively, it’s easy to understand why many would consider us fortunate.
Terrorism is on the rise in Europe, just as Colombia’s civil war, the region’s last, is ending.
Argentines, Brazilians, and Chileans of my generation grew up with heavily armed soldiers patrolling airports, train stations, and other public places.
Today we see the same in Brussels, Paris, and London, not here.
Compared to US President Donald Trump, some of Latin America’s populist politicians seem almost competent and well informed.
But this is not the first time Latin Americans can feel this way.
As Carlos Díaz-Alejandro, the great Cuban-American economic historian, put it:
“Reviewing the 1930s and 1940s, most Latin Americans could feel lucky, at least relative to the rest of humanity.
The Spanish and the Chinese Civil Wars, World War II, the depth of depression in the United States, Stalinist purges, the political dependence of Asia and Africa, and the pains of decolonization in India and elsewhere could be viewed by Brazilians and Mexicans as remote events that could not happen here any more.”
The sharpest contrast was political.
“In contrast with the ideological, religious, and ethnic frenzies of Europe, India, and even North America,” Díaz-Alejandro continues, “most Latin Americans viewed themselves then as tolerant, a view largely correct at least in relative terms, and demonstrated by the many refugees who found a haven in the region.”
The year 1948 saw the outbreak of “la violencia” in Colombia; today we witness the murderous persecution of President Nicolás Maduro’s political opponents in Venezuela.
Political repression was common in Central America back then, and remains common in Cuba today.
But they are the exceptions that confirm the rule.
Just as “the 1930s and 1940s witnessed little political bloodletting in Latin America,” in Díaz-Alejandro’s words, the same is largely true today.
Our democracies remain imperfect, but the region’s increasing political stability is undeniable.
We have had our share of wild-eyed populists recently.
But with the exception of Venezuela, where authoritarian chavistas remain in power despite massive opposition, populism is on the wane.
In Ecuador, former president Rafael Correa managed to get his handpicked successor elected, but low oil prices and dollar shortages make a turn toward policy moderation quite likely.
In Argentina, President Mauricio Macri, who ousted the Peronist-populist Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, remains popular despite an inevitable economic adjustment and slow growth.
The 1930s and 1940s were a time of great social and political change in the region.
Migration from abroad and from the countryside to the city gave rise to a new urban middle class employed mostly in government-related jobs.
The political clout of traditional land-owning elites declined, and powerful new working-class-based parties began to emerge.
Today, a new middle class – employed mostly in private firms – is on the rise.
In many countries, consumption has been booming, even as economic growth slows.
Shopping malls crop up in newly built suburbs, and Facebook has made it to the smallest Andean village.
Economic inequality remains high, but income disparities in Latin America have been narrowing for nearly two decades, just as they widened in the United States and Europe.
There are other economic similarities with the past.
One is the trajectory of commodity export prices, which increased through the late 1930s and 1940s, following the Depression-era collapse.
They likewise increased after the 2008-09 crisis, peaking in 2015.
In both cases, deciding what to do with the surfeit of dollars was a key policy choice.
Because the 1940s were, in Díaz-Alejandro’s words, the “golden age of import-substituting industrialization in Latin America,” the increase in export values and the compression of imports meant large trade surpluses, which were often used to repay debt.
Today, by contrast, most local private sectors have been borrowing abroad to finance what were, until recently, rising current account deficits.
Large stocks of dollar-denominated debt remain a key vulnerability.
As Latin America entered the 1950s and new export sectors failed to emerge, dollar abundance turned into dollar scarcity.
Boom-bust cycles and currency crises became common.
In what remains of this decade, the region’s policymakers will have to work hard to ensure that it doesn’t happen again, especially as rich-country central banks normalize interest rates and capital flows threaten to turn back toward the advanced economies.
A key to the relative success of Latin America in the 1930s and 1940s was the willingness to throw out old orthodoxies and experiment with new policies.
In response to the Great Depression, most countries abandoned the gold standard, developed new exchange-rate arrangements, and tried novel policies to stimulate local industry.
“Latin American economic thinking came into its own during the 1940s,” writes Díaz-Alejandro. “The creation of the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America was the major impetus behind ... fresh economic approaches.”
Fresh thinking is also needed today, to sustain Latin America’s recent political and economic gains.
The turn away from populism is anything but assured, especially if economies do not start growing again soon.
With the commodity boom unlikely to return, Latin America urgently needs new export products – and here a bit of modern, if unorthodox, industrial policy could prove useful.
Politics also needs to be shaken up.
Public dissatisfaction with traditional elites and parties is on the rise.
Successful new political vehicles like Macri’s Propuesta Republicana (PRO) are still the exception.
The political opening that occurred in many Latin American countries in the 1930s and 1940s eventually gave way to the political disarray of the 1960s and the dictatorships of the 1970s and 1980s.
We must not allow that to happen again.
A Bangladeshi Prescription for Cholera
DHAKA – By now, cholera should be history.
For decades, health officials have understood how to prevent the disease, doctors have known how to treat it, and development experts have recognized that with clean water and sanitation, outbreaks rarely become epidemics.
Unfortunately, the world is not so simple and neat, and the nightmare of cholera persists.
In many parts of the world, cholera has in fact been tamed.
Waterborne illnesses are virtually nonexistent in advanced economies.
And even in resource-starved countries and regions where cholera remains a problem, the availability of oral rehydration therapy, or ORT, has helped prevent countless deaths.
And yet cholera continues to flare up during times of crisis, killing the most vulnerable among us.
One of the worst epidemics today is ravaging Yemen, where armed conflict has led to the collapse of health, water, and sanitation systems – precisely the conditions under which cholera thrives.
The first cholera cases were reported in October 2016; within a year, the number of cases had soared to more than 600,000.
International organizations like the United Nations and the World Health Organization, in cooperation with Yemeni health-care officials, have mounted an impressive response.
Their efforts have kept the fatality rate to roughly 0.33% of infections (some 2,000 deaths), mitigating the tragedy.
But Yemenis are working in impossible conditions, and need resources and training.
My country is leading the effort to ensure that they receive both.
In October, a team of Yemeni nurses and doctors arrived at the International Centre of Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (icddr,b), where I have worked for much of my professional life.
Our institute is the birthplace of ORT, and medical professionals from around the world come to Dhaka to be trained to administer this simple solution of sugar, salt, other elements, and water.
Over the course of a week, Yemen’s health professionals received training on outbreak management, surveillance methods, and sanitation.
They observed the treatment of cholera patients in our hospital, an experience that provided hands-on training for case management and assessing dehydration status.
This is just one example of how icddr,b has helped alleviate human suffering in times of crisis.
As a founding member of the WHO’s Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN), icddr,b has deployed expert teams to Zimbabwe, Sudan, South Sudan, Mozambique, Syria, Somalia, Haiti, Sierra Leone, Ethiopia, and Iraq.
By sharing the knowledge and expertise that we have developed over decades of diarrheal disease management and research, we are playing a leading role in global efforts to tackle outbreaks.
Bangladesh knows wartime cholera all too well.
In 1971, fighting broke out when Bangladesh, then known as East Pakistan, declared independence from Pakistan.
In the ensuing conflict, refugees poured across the border into neighboring India into crowded camps, creating conditions that inevitably gave rise to cholera outbreaks.
The standard of care at the time was poor, and a dearth of intravenous drips meant that rehydration solutions could not be administered widely.
As many people lay dying, a pioneering doctor named Dilip Mahalanabis took a chance in a desperate situation.
American researchers in Bangladesh had shown that ORT could reverse fatal dehydration in cholera patients, but its effectiveness outside hospitals had not yet been proven.
Lacking proper equipment and medical facilities, Mahalanabis administered ORT in camps, and in the process, saved thousands of lives.
As a result, ORT became the new standard of care for diarrheal disease treatment; it has since saved more than 80 million people around the world.
Now, new wartime cholera crises have emerged, and Bangladeshi expertise is again being called into service.
Yemen is only one example.
Since August, hundreds of thousands of Rohingya have crossed the border into Bangladesh from Myanmar, the highest weekly outflow of refugees anywhere in the world since the Rwandan genocide in 1994.
These desperate and vulnerable people are crowded into refugee camps, and there is a high risk that conditions may lead to a deadly cholera epidemic.
In response to this threat, icddr,b is collaborating with UNICEF, the WHO, and other important stakeholders on multiple cholera-prevention initiatives.
Efforts are being made to improve access to clean water and sanitation, and ORT sachets are being stockpiled.
We have also worked with the WHO to secure some 900,000 doses of oral cholera vaccine (OCV), an internationally accepted tool to prevent and control outbreaks.
Like ORT, the development of OCV has roots in Bangladesh, and at icddr,b in particular.
The vaccine’s first successful field trials were conducted at icddr,b in the 1980s, and today, our scientists are drawing on decades of institutional knowledge to execute the second-largest OCV campaign ever conducted.
It might be hard to imagine that a developing country like Bangladesh could play a pioneering role in managing a disease of such magnitude.
But time and again, researchers and health workers in Bangladesh have demonstrated their expertise at containing cholera outbreaks and saving lives.
As the world looks for new ways to curb opportunistic epidemics, it must not overlook the science that developing countries already possess.
Cholera is back in the Global South.
But, as our work in Bangladesh demonstrates, the Global South has the skills to beat it.
Convicts for Export
NEW DELHI – China has devised a novel strategy to relieve pressure on its overcrowded prisons: employ convicts as laborers on overseas projects in the developing world.
The practice has exposed another facet of China’s egregious human-rights record, which, when it comes to the overseas operations of Chinese companies, includes the government’s failure to enforce its own regulations.
China executes three times as many people every year as the rest of the world combined.
Amnesty International has estimated that, in 2007, China secretly executed on average “around 22 prisoners every day.”
In addition to being the world’s leading executioner, China has one of its largest prison populations.
The 2009 “World Prison Population List” compiled by the International Center for Prison Studies at King’s College, London, put the total number of inmates in Chinese jails at 1.57 million – larger than the population of Estonia, Guinea-Bissau, Mauritius, Swaziland, Trinidad & Tobago, Fiji, or Qatar.
The forced dispatch of prisoners to work on overseas infrastructure projects raises new issues regarding China’s human-rights record.
It also adds a new element — the dumping of convicts — to its trade and investment policy, which has been much criticized for dumping goods.
Thousands of Chinese convicts, for example, have been pressed into service on projects undertaken by state-run Chinese companies in Sri Lanka, a strategically important country for China as it seeks to enhance its regional position in the Indian Ocean.
After providing Sri Lanka’s government with offensive weapon systems that helped end the country’s decades-long civil war, China has been rewarded with port-building, railroad, and other infrastructure projects.
Chinese convicts also have been dispatched to the Maldives, where the Chinese government is building 4,000 houses on several different islands as a government-to-government “gift” to win influence.
So far, however, China has failed to persuade the country’s president to lease it one of the 700 uninhabited Maldivian islands for use as a small base for the Chinese navy.
Chinese companies’ operating practice for overseas projects, including in Africa, is to keep the number of local workers to a bare minimum and to bring in much of the workforce from China, some of which comprises convicts “freed” on parole for project-related overseas work.
Convict laborers, like the rest of the Chinese workforce on such projects, are housed near the project site.
That way, if any convict worker escaped, he would be easy to find in an alien setting.
In theory, such practices run counter to regulations promulgated by the Chinese commerce ministry in August 2006, in response to a backlash against Chinese businesses in Zambia following the death of 51 Zambian workers in an explosion at a Chinese-owned copper mine.
These regulations called for “local­ization,” including hiring local workers, respecting local customs, and adhering to safety norms.
During an eight-nation 2007 African tour, Chinese President Hu Jintao made a point of meeting with Chinese businesses to stress the importance of corporate responsibility in their local dealings.
Moreover, in October 2006, the State Council – China’s cabinet – issued nine directives ordering that Chinese overseas businesses, among other things, “pay attention to environmental protection,” “support local community and people’s livelihood cause,” and “preserve China’s good image and its good corporate reputation.”
But Chinese regulations are sometimes promulgated simply to blunt external criticism, and thus are seldom enforced, except when a case attracts international attention.
For example, in 2003 China enacted a law on environmental-impact assessments, which was followed in 2008 by “provisional measures” to permit public participation in such assessments.
Yet Chinese leaders remain more zealous about promoting exports and economic growth than in protecting the country’s air and water.
Similarly, the State Council’s 2006 nine directives to Chinese overseas companies have been subordinated to the drive for exports and growth, even when it imposes environmental and social costs on local communities abroad.
Indeed, as part of the government’s “going global” policy, Chinese companies are offered major incentives and rewards for bagging overseas contracts and boosting exports.
The use of convict laborers adds a disturbing new dimension to this strategy.
But even before convicts became part of China’s overseas development effort, some Chinese projects, especially dam-building schemes, were embroiled in disputes with local communities in Botswana, Burma, Pakistan, Ghana, and Sudan.
In fact, several small bombs exploded less than three months ago at the site of Burma’s Myitsone Dam, whose construction by a Chinese company in insurgency-torn Kachin State is displacing thousands of subsistence farmers and fishermen by flooding a wide swath of land.
Chinese companies cannot get thousands of prisoners released on their own, let alone secure passports and exit permits for them.
It is obvious that the practice of pressing convicts into service on overseas projects has been instituted at the instance of the Chinese government.
Until the Chinese government’s treatment of its own citizens and those of other countries is guided by respect for basic human rights and the rule of law, China is unlikely to command the respect that it seeks on the world stage.
Time for Helicopter Money?
WASHINGTON, DC – “Out of ammo?” The Economist recently asked of monetary policymakers.
Stephen Roach has called the move by major central banks – including the Bank of Japan, the European Central Bank, and the Bank of Sweden – to negative real (and, in some cases, even nominal) interest rates a “futile” effort that merely sets “the stage for the next crisis.”
And, at the February G-20 finance ministers meeting, Bank of England Governor Mark Carney reportedly called these policies “ultimately a zero-sum game.”
Have the major advanced economies’ central banks – which have borne the burden of sustaining anemic post-2008 recoveries – really run out of options?
It certainly seems so.
Central-bank balance sheets have swelled, and policy rates have reached their “near zero” lower bounds.
There is plenty of cheap water, it seems, but the horse refuses to drink.
With no signs of inflation, and growth still tepid and fragile, many anticipate chronic slow growth, with some even fearing another global recession.
But policymakers have one more option: a shift to “purer” fiscal policy, in which they directly finance government spending by printing money – a so-called “helicopter drop.”
The new money would bypass the financial and corporate sectors and go straight to the thirstiest horses: middle- and lower-income consumers.
The money could go to them directly, and through investment in job-creating, productivity-increasing infrastructure.
By placing purchasing power in the hands of those who need it most, direct monetary financing of public spending would also help to improve inclusiveness in economies where inequality is rising fast.
Helicopter drops are currently proposed by both leftist and centrist economists.
In a sense, even some “conservatives” – who support more public infrastructure spending, but also want tax cuts and oppose more borrowing – de facto support helicopter drops.
Recently, more radical proposals have surfaced, reflecting a sense of urgency and widespread disappointment with the impact of current monetary policy.
Beyond advocating higher minimum wages, some are calling for “reverse income policies,” with governments imposing across-the-board wage increases on private employers – a move that would drive up prices and defeat deflationary expectations.
The fact that economists whose views typically fall nowhere near those of the far left are even thinking about such interventionism shows just how extreme circumstances have become.
I favor all of these proposals, in some form.
The details of their implementation would obviously have to vary, depending on each economy’s circumstances.
Germany, for example, is in a strong position to implement a reverse income policy, given its huge current-account surplus, though there would undoubtedly be major political barriers.
More spending on education, skills upgrading, and infrastructure, however, is a no-brainer almost everywhere, and is politically more feasible.
But there is another dimension of the challenge that has so far not been emphasized nearly enough, despite the warnings of Carney, Roach, and others.
Zero or negative real interest rates, when they become quasi-permanent, undermine the efficient allocation of capital and set the stage for bubbles, busts, and crises.
They also contribute to further income concentration at the top by hurting small savers, while creating opportunities for large financial players to benefit from access to savings at negative real cost.
As unorthodox as it may sound, it is likely that the world economy would benefit from somewhat higher interest rates.
Raising interest rates cannot, however, be a stand-alone policy.
Instead, small policy-rate increases must be incorporated into a broader fiscal and distributional strategy, implemented alongside more public spending on infrastructure and skills upgrading, as well as some gentle forms of income policies, employing, for example, “moral suasion.”
Even with such an approach, however, major central banks would have to coordinate their policies.
If a single major central bank attempted to introduce higher interest rates, its economy would immediately be “punished” through currency appreciation, declining competitiveness, and falling exports, all of which would undermine aggregate demand and employment.
If the major central banks decided to increase their policy rates simultaneously, these spillover effects would cancel one another out.
A coordinated move, perhaps raising rates in two modest 25 or 30 basis-point increments, would be neutral in terms of exchange rates and short-term competitiveness, even as it moved real interest rates back into positive territory.
If successful, this effort could eventually be followed by further small increases, creating space for more traditional monetary-policy “ammunition” to be deployed in the future.
Success also hinges on the simultaneous pursuit of fiscal expansion worldwide, with each country’s efforts calibrated according to its fiscal space and current-account position.
The expansion should finance a global program of investment in physical and human infrastructure, focusing on the two key challenges of our time: cleaner energy and skills for the digital age.
A coordinated and well-timed policy package could boost global growth, improve capital allocation, support a more equitable income distribution, and reduce the danger of speculative bubbles.
The various meetings in the run-up to the G-20 summit in China, including the spring meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, would be ideal forums for designing such a package, and advancing its implementation.
Economic orthodoxy and independent actions have clearly failed.
It is time for policymakers to recognize that innovative international policy cooperation is not a luxury; sometimes – like today – it is a necessity.
The Better Corporation
LONDON – Around the world, the corporate governance landscape is shifting, as efforts to improve business practices and policies gain support and momentum.
The wave of reform has become visible everywhere – from tough new regulations in Japan to sovereign wealth funds like Norway’s Norges Bank Investment Management taking a more active approach to their investments – and it is certain to continue to rise.
Three factors are driving these developments.
First, today’s deep economic uncertainty has broadened ordinary people’s awareness of the influence that companies have on politics, policy, and their own daily lives.
And, as I have noted previously, people are not only paying greater attention; they also have more power than ever before to make their voices heard.
Second, there has been a burgeoning awareness among governments that economic growth requires a proactive regulatory approach.
Robust and resilient economies need strong businesses, and to build strong businesses, governments must play a role in ensuring high-integrity oversight of business activity.
Company stewardship and country stewardship are increasingly linked, and authorities now recognize that paying to ensure good governance now is far less costly (both financially and politically) than paying for the consequences of bad governance later.
In Japan, the Financial Services Agency enacted a Stewardship Code in 2014, with a Corporate Governance Code from the Tokyo Stock Exchange entering into force this June.
By creating a more equal environment among shareholders, ensuring more disclosure and transparency, specifying the responsibilities of company boards, and requiring outside independent directors on company boards, the codes enshrine changes that make Japan more attractive for foreign investors.
More generally, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has emphasized that good corporate governance is critical to long-term economic growth and prosperity.
Toshiba’s recent accounting scandal – the company was found to have inflated its profits by ¥151.8 billion ($1.2 billion) over several years since 2008 – presents an opportunity for Japan’s government to demonstrate its seriousness about the new regulations.
Toshiba CEO Hisao Tanaka and other senior executives have had to resign; the interim CEO apologized to Abe’s office; Norio Sasaki, the company’s vice chairman and former CEO, has quit his posts on government panels; and the former chairman of Toshiba’s audit committee has stepped down from the government accounting panel.
In the United States, the Securities and Exchange Commission enacted a rule at the beginning of August requiring public companies to disclose the pay gap between workers and CEOs.
Corporate behavior and governance has emerged as a campaign issue for US presidential candidates.
Hillary Clinton gave a speech at the end of July decrying “quarterly capitalism” that chases short-term growth at the expense of sustainable business development, as well as addressing the exponential growth of CEO pay, and the need for a minimum-wage increase.
The European Union and its member states are also taking an increasingly active approach to corporate governance, including regulations concerning boardroom diversity.
Italy, France, Spain, Norway, and others have all enacted boardroom gender quotas, with companies required to fill 30-40% of independent board seats with women.
The latest example can be found in Germany, where, after much debate, new quotas require that from 2016 large companies fill 30% of non-executive board seats with women.
The third, and perhaps most important, factor underpinning recent changes in corporate governance has been the sharp rise in cross-border investing.
Sovereign wealth funds, pension funds, global investment banks, and hedge funds do not invest only in their own backyard.
They scour the planet looking for places to put their money, and they expect companies that receive it to play by rational rules.
The Olympus scandal of 2011-2012 – when investigations in Japan, the United Kingdom, and the US revealed that company executives falsified accounts to hide losses of ¥117.7 billion – is a watershed example of a traditional closed corporate culture coming up against international scrutiny.
As the full extent of the cover-up was revealed, foreign investors, like GIC Private Limited (Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund), rebelled.
Singapore sold nearly all of its 2% stake almost immediately, and other foreign investors and analysts reacted similarly.
It was a turning point for Japan, as the country’s clubby investment culture came up against global transparency and accounting standards.
Things have not been the same since, either for Japan or for companies’ understanding of the expectations and influence of international investors.
International investors are in a unique position to encourage, or even enforce, global best practices in corporate governance.
If such investors show that they are willing to withdraw financing, they will gain real influence in bringing about sustainable change – to the benefit of us all.
This is especially true if investors are guided by principles that go beyond financial returns.
Global funds that uphold high ethical standards concerning labor practices and environmental protections are safeguarding the global ecosystem on which they, and the rest of us, depend.
As they establish and implement such principles, the resulting momentum has been changing corporate governance and behavior across industries and regions.
This is evident from several high-profile examples.
CalPERS (the California Public Employees’ Retirement System), a $300 billion pension fund, has published its corporate governance principles, which include boardroom diversity, fair labor practices, and environmental protection.
Norges Bank Investment Management, Norway’s $870 billion sovereign wealth fund (the largest in the world), has also pushed for changing governance rules, including separating the role of chief executive and chairman and better reporting by companies on how they are addressing climate change.
The shift in emphasis on best-practice corporate governance is real, and it is here to stay.
It comes from people finding and raising their voices, from politicians recognizing the importance of corporate governance for sustainable economic growth, and from influential investors putting genuine pressure on companies to change their behavior.
Companies and boards ignore this trend at their peril.
GDP Should Be Corrected, Not Replaced
ZURICH – Respected economists have long pointed out that gross domestic product is an inadequate measure of economic development and social well-being, and thus should not be policymakers’ sole fixation.
Yet we have not gotten any closer to finding a feasible alternative to GDP.
One well-known shortcoming of GDP is that it disregards the value of housework, including care for children and elderly family members.
More important, assigning a monetary value to such activities would not address a deeper flaw in GDP: its inability to reflect adequately the lived experience of individual members of society.
Correcting for housework would inflate GDP, while making no real difference to living standards.
And the women who make up a predominant share of people performing housework would continue to be treated as volunteers, rather than as genuine economic contributors.
Another well-known flaw of GDP is that it does not account for value destruction, such as when countries mismanage their human capital by withholding education from certain demographic groups, or by depleting natural resources for immediate economic benefit.
All told, GDP tends to measure assets imprecisely, and liabilities not at all.
Still, while no international consensus on an alternative to GDP has emerged, there has been encouraging progress toward a more considered way of thinking about economic activity.
In 1972, Yale University economists William Nordhaus and James Tobin proposed a new framework, the “measure of economic welfare” (MEW), to account for sundry unpaid activities.
And, more recently, China established a “green development” index, which considers economic performance alongside various environmental factors.
Moreover, public- and private-sector decision-makers now have far more tools for making sophisticated choices than they did in the past.
On the investor side, demand for environmental, social, and governance data is rising steeply.
And in the public sector, organizations such as the World Bank have adopted metrics other than GDP to assess quality of life, including life expectancy at birth and access to education.
At the same time, the debate around gross national income has been gaining steam.
Though it shares fundamental elements with GDP, GNI is more relevant to our globalized age, because it adjusts for income generated by foreign-owned corporations and foreign residents.
Accordingly, in a country where foreign corporations own a significant share of manufacturing and other assets, GDP will be inflated, whereas GNI shows only income the country actually retains (see chart).
Ireland is a prominent example of how GNI has been used to correct for distortions in GDP.
In 2015, Ireland’s reported GDP increased by an eye-popping 26.3%.
As an October 2016 OECD working paper noted, the episode raised serious questions about the “ability of the conceptual accounting framework used to define GDP to adequately reflect economic reality.”
The OECD paper went on to conclude that GDP is not a reliable indicator of a country’s material well-being.
In Ireland’s case, its single year of astonishing GDP growth was due to multinational corporations “relocating” certain economic gains – namely, the returns on intellectual property – in their overall accounting.
To address the growing disparity between actual economic development and reported GDP, the Irish Central Statistics Office introduced a modified version of GNI known as GNI*) for 2016.
The gap between GDP and GNI will likely close soon in other jurisdictions, too.
In a recent working paper, Urooj Khan of Columbia Business School, Suresh Nallareddy of Duke University, and Ethan Rouen of Harvard Business School highlight a misalignment in “the growth in corporate profits and the overall US economy” between 1975 and 2013.
They find that, during that period, average corporate-profit growth outpaced GDP growth whenever the domestic corporate-income-tax rate exceeded that of other OECD countries.
In late December, this disconnect was addressed with the passage of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.
By lowering the corporate-tax rate to a globally competitive level and granting better terms for repatriating profits, the tax package is expected to shift corporate earnings back to the United States.
As a result, the divergence between GDP and GNI will likely close in both the US and Ireland, where many major US corporations have been holding cash.
Looking ahead, I would suggest that policymakers focus on three points.
First, as demonstrated above, the relevant stakeholders are already addressing several of the flaws in GDP, which is encouraging.
Second, public- and private-sector decision-makers now have a multitude of instruments available for better assessing the social and environmental ramifications of their actions.
And, third, in business one must not let the perfect become the enemy of the good.
We have not solved all of the problems associated with GDP, but we have come a long way in reducing many of its distortions.
Instead of seeking a new, disruptive framework to replace current data and analytical techniques, we should focus on making thoughtful, incremental changes to the existing system.
The Education Antidote to Radicalization
DUBAI – No visitor to the Middle East can avoid noticing the yawning gap between the educational, entrepreneurial, and occupational aspirations of the region’s young people and the harsh reality that deprives so many of them of a positive future.
Indeed, in the Middle East, half of those aged 18-25 are either unemployed or underemployed.
Aggravating this situation is the global refugee crisis, which has displaced some 30 million children, six million from Syria alone, very few of whom are likely to return home during their school-age years.
It should come as no surprise that the group known in the region as Daesh (the Islamic State) believes that it can find fertile ground for recruitment in this vast population of dispossessed and disaffected young people.
Daesh propagandists are misusing social media in the way that their extremist predecessors and contemporaries have sometimes misused mosques – as a forum for radicalization.
The group consistently posts content that challenges the possibility of coexistence between Islam and the West and calls young people to jihad.
The grotesquely violent videos that Daesh produces have shock appeal.
But what really attracts disaffected young people is the invitation to be part of something that seems larger than themselves and the societies in which they live.
Shiraz Maher of the International Center for the Study of Radicalization (ICSR) at King’s College London identifies a common thread of sentiment among recruits: “righteous indignation, defiance, a sense of persecution, and a refusal to conform.”
As a recent Quilliam Foundation report concludes, Daesh plays on the youthful desire to be part of something worthwhile; it is the organization’s utopian appeal that is most alluring to new recruits.
Given this, few would disagree that we find ourselves in a generational battle for hearts and minds that cannot be won by military means alone.
Hard power can eliminate Daesh’s hardcore leaders.
But we will need more than that to convince nearly 200 million young Muslims that extremism is, quite literally, a dead end.
There are many examples of under-the-radar operations working to counter extremism across the Indian subcontinent and the Middle East: children’s magazines in Pakistan, videos aimed at teenagers in North Africa, radio stations in the Middle East, and books and publications opposing Al Qaeda.
They can help to expose the truth about life in Daesh – that it is brutal, corrupt, and prone to internal purges – in several ways, including by drawing attention to defections.
As a 2014 report states, “[the very existence of defectors] shatters the image of unity and determination that [the group] seeks to convey.”
But we must be more ambitious if we are to win the war of ideas, sustaining the cultural space that Daesh calls the “the grey zone,” which it longs to destroy. It is a space in which Muslims and non-Muslims can coexist, discover their shared values, and cooperate.
Peter Neumann, the director of the ICSR, has proposed a YouTube contest for videos that explain the failings of Daesh.
“You would receive 5,000 videos in no time,” he says. “Four thousand are junk, but 1,000 of them are effective – 1,000 videos against [Daesh] propaganda.”
The best long-term tool for countering extremism, however, is education.
In Jaffa, Israel, a school run by the Church of Scotland teaches the virtues of tolerance to Muslim, Jewish, and Christian children.
Throughout Lebanon, a common school curriculum championing religious diversity – including the “refusal of any radicalism and religious or sectarian seclusion” – is being taught to Sunni, Shia, and Christian children starting at the age of nine.
The country has also introduced double shifts in its school system to accommodate some 200,000 Syrian refugee children.
If troubled Lebanon, wracked by sectarian violence and religious divides, can champion coexistence and provide Syrian refugees with a chance to study, there is no reason other countries in the region should not follow its example.
The choice could not be clearer.
We can stand by and watch a new generation of web-savvy Muslim youth be deluged with false claims that Islam cannot coexist with Western values.
Or we can recognize that the young people of the Middle East and the rest of the Muslim world share the aspirations of young people in every other part of the world.
All the evidence indicates that the region’s young people want education, employment, and the chance to make the most of their talents.
Our resolution for 2016 should be to make that happen.
Can We Have Too Much Sex?
LONDON – “Sex is like money,” John Updike wrote, “only too much is enough.”
As it turns out, that is not strictly true, at least not in the context of monogamous relationships.
So how much sex is enough?
In 2015, a group of University of Toronto-based psychologists set out to find out.
In their study, “Sexual Frequency Predicts Greater Well-Being, But More is Not Always Better,” Amy Muise, Ulrich Schimmack, and Emily Impett revealed that there is, in fact, a precise rate of sex that, for the average couple, optimally benefits the partners’ wellbeing: once per week.
The study found that the difference in wellbeing for people in relationships who engage in sex once per week, compared with those who have sex less than once per month, was greater than the difference in wellbeing for those earning $75,000 versus those making $25,000.
In other words, having sex four times as much boosted participants’ moods as much as an additional $50,000 per year would do.
But, just as having sex too infrequently can leave couples less happy, having sex too frequently can end up being more stressful than pleasurable, particularly if busy couples feel under pressure to do so.
Yet such pressure – stemming, at least partly, from social expectations and comparisons – is very real.
The University of Colorado sociologist Tim Wadsworth, in his 2014 study, “Sex and the Pursuit of Happiness: How Other People’s Sex Lives are Related to our Sense of Well-Being,” repeats Updike’s assertion that sex is like money.
But, in Wadsworth’s argument, what they have in common is that they both derive value from comparison.
As Wadsworth points out, past research has shown that it is not absolute income levels that determine happiness, but rather income levels relative to those around you – the colleagues, neighbors, former classmates, and others who form your reference group.
That is why a rising income does not necessarily bring a corresponding increase in happiness: it is crucial that the incomes of one’s reference group aren’t also rising.
Similarly, Wadsworth’s survey found that respondents who believe that they have more sex than their reference group are happier, while those who believe that their cohorts are having more sex than them are less content.
Wadsworth therefore concludes that happiness is positively correlated with one’s own sexual frequency, but negatively correlated with the sexual frequency of others.
But, beyond a certain point – roughly once per week, apparently – the benefits that a couple derives from sex wane.
This suggests that there is more to the relationship between sex and happiness than keeping up with the Joneses.
And, in fact, by putting pressure on couples to have sex as often as possible, the sense of competition may be doing more harm than good.
A recent study – “More Than Just Sex: Affection Mediates the Association Between Sexual Activity and Well-Being” – offers a novel theory regarding the link between sex and happiness.
Its authors – Anik Debrot, Nathalie Meuwly, Amy Muise, Emily Impett, and Dominik Schoebi – contend that the true power of sex in a relationship lies in the capacity of sex to foster a stronger connection between partners through shared affection, not just shared pleasure.
The authors even suggest that sex and affection could compensate for each other in supporting wellbeing, with increased affection counterbalancing reductions in sexual activity during some life phases, such as just after childbirth – a period sometimes associated with higher risk for infidelity in male partners.
The idea is that more alternative expressions of affection may help to sustain wellbeing, thereby decreasing the temptation to stray (though, because men generally report higher sexual desire, they may rely more on sex as a way of experiencing affection than the average woman does).
It seems that psychology may rebut Updike’s dictum that only too much sex is enough.
In fact, while regular sex is vital to promote intimacy and foster happiness through shared affection, more is not always better.
So sex may be like money, but only in that too little is bad.
The Holy Grail of Genetic Engineering
HONG KONG – Since its introduction four decades ago, genetic engineering has been a source of high hopes for health, agriculture, and industry.
But it has also provoked deep anxiety, not least owing to the laborious nature of the genome-editing process.
Now, a new technique, CRISPR-Cas, offers both precision and the ability to modify the genome text at several places simultaneously.
But this has not eliminated reason for concern.
The genome can be viewed as a kind of musical score.
Just as sheet music tells musicians in an orchestra when and how to play, the genome tells the cell’s component parts (generally proteins) what they must do.
A score may also include notes from the composer, showing possible changes, frills that can be added or omitted depending on the circumstances.
For the genome, such “notes” emerge from cell survival over many generations in an ever-changing environment.
The DNA genetic program is akin to a fragile book: the order of its pages can change, with some even being moved to another cell’s program.
If a page is, say, laminated, it is less likely to be damaged as it is moved around.
Likewise, elements of a genetic program protected by a solid coating are better able to invade a variety of cells, and then to reproduce as the cell reproduces.
Ultimately, that element becomes a virus, spreading rapidly.
The next step is for the cell that reproduces a virus, whether useless or harmful, to develop some way to resist it.
And, in fact, it was in this manner – as a bacteria’s defense against invading viruses – that the CRISPR-Cas process first emerged.
That process allows acquired characteristics to become inherited.
In the course of a first infection, a small fragment of the viral genome – a kind of signature – is copied into the CRISPR genomic island (an extra piece of genome, outside of the parent genome text).
As a result, the memory of the infection is retained across generations.
When a descendant of the cell is infected with a virus, the sequence will be compared to the viral genome.
If a similar virus has infected a cell’s parent, the descendant will recognize it, and ad hoc machinery will destroy it.
This complex process took many decades for scientists to decipher, not least because it controverted standard theories of evolution.
But now scientists have figured out how to replicate the process, enabling humans to edit, with the utmost precision, specific genomes – the Holy Grail of genetic engineering for nearly 50 years.
This means that scientists can apply the CRISPR-Cas mechanism to correct problems in the genome – the equivalent of typos in a written text.
For example, in the case of cancer, we would want to destroy those genes that allow the multiplication of tumor cells.
We are also interested in introducing genes in cells that never gained them by natural genetic transfer.
There is nothing new about these objectives.
But, with CRISPR-Cas, we are far better equipped to achieve them.
Previous techniques left traces in the modified genomes, contributing, for example, to antibiotic resistance.
A mutation obtained by CRISPR-Cas, by contrast, is not distinguishable from a mutation that emerged spontaneously.
That is why the US Food and Drug Administration has ruled that such constructs do not need to be labeled as genetically modified organisms.
Previous techniques were especially arduous if one needed to modify several genes, because the process would need to occur sequentially.
With CRISPR-Cas, the ability to perform genome modifications simultaneously has already enabled the creation of fungi and apples that do not oxidize, or turn brown, when they come into contact with air – a result that required several genes to be deactivated simultaneously.
Such apples are already on the market, and are not considered genetically modified organisms.
Other applications are in development.
The so-called gene drive procedure for manipulating the genome could diminish the harm caused by disease-carrying insects.
Targeted modification of gametes in mosquitoes – the world’s deadliest animal to humans – would render them incapable of transmitting a virus or parasite.
But the application of CRISPR-Cas must be approached with care.
While the technology could prove a boon in the fight against many deadly diseases, it also implies serious – and potentially entirely unpredictable – risks.
For starters, because genomes multiply and spread with reproduction, modifying an entire population would require modifications to only a limited number of individuals, especially if the organism’s lifecycle is short.
Moreover, given the ubiquity of hybridization among neighboring species, it is possible that the modification of a mosquito species would also spread progressively and uncontrollably to other species.
Analysis of animal genomes shows that such events have taken place in the past, with species invaded by genetic elements that could have affected ecosystem balances and species evolution (though it is impossible to say how).
And, if modifying a mosquito population is dangerous, there is no telling what could happen if we modify human cells – in particular, germ cells – without doing our due diligence.
CRISPR-Cas technology is poised to change the world.
The imperative now is to ensure that those changes are positive.
Strategies for Responsible Gene Editing
CAMBRIDGE – The discovery of a powerful new tool capable of addressing health and environmental problems as diverse as malaria, Lyme disease, and invasive species should be a cause for celebration.
But, because the tool, called CRISPR, can alter entire populations of wild organisms (and thus shared ecosystems), ensuring that these interventions are developed responsibly poses an unprecedented challenge for science and society.
Humans have been altering animals and plants through selective breeding for millennia; but, because these changes typically reduce the capacity for survival and reproduction in the wild, they do not spread to wild populations.
Alterations accomplished using CRISPR, which enables scientists to edit a cell’s DNA with unprecedented precision, are different in one crucial respect: The process can result in “gene drive,” a naturally occurring feature of some genes that enables them to spread through a population over generations, even if they do not help survival (and thus reproduction).
Simply put, we can now contemplate altering wild populations in very specific and consequential ways.
Those changes can be highly positive.
By altering certain features of mosquitos, we could reduce or even eradicate ancient scourges such as malaria and dengue that afflict hundreds of millions of people each year.
(Malaria alone kills a child every 90 seconds, on average.)
By permanently immunizing the relevant animal populations, we could prevent new cases of Lyme and other diseases that originate in wild organisms, or we could block newly emergent pathogens such as the Zika virus, which has been linked to an epidemic of stunted brain development in newborns in Latin America.
As for the environment, human activities have already impacted every ecosystem on Earth, with far-reaching consequences – for us and many other species – many of which are yet to unfold.
Gene drive elements could potentially reverse much of this damage.
For example, limiting invasive species – such as cane toads in Australia, mosquitoes in Hawaii, or rats and mice almost everywhere – could help to restore damaged biomes.
And eliminating pests’ attraction to our crops, without diminishing their capacity to fulfill their other ecological roles, would remove the need for toxic pesticides.
As we attempt to realize these tremendous potential benefits, however, we must bear in mind that the effects of gene drive interventions will be shared by entire communities.
Given the vast complexity of ecosystems, careful research will be needed to assess the consequences of each intervention before proceeding.
CRISPR gene drives also highlight a problem that goes beyond ecology: Existing systems for developing and evaluating new technologies are woefully inadequate for powerful new tools with broad impacts.
It should be self-evident that technologies like gene drives, which don’t require widespread adoption to have a widespread effect, should never be released without informed community consent.
Yet history shows the opposite pattern, with decision-making seldom factoring in environmental consequences or citizens’ opinions.
Nowadays, there are few opportunities for public input until after products are developed, when it is typically too late to make changes.
By ignoring potentially helpful contributions from an increasingly knowledgeable public, closed-door technological development has precluded balanced assessments and created acrimony – a dangerously irresponsible and wasteful outcome for both science and society.
CRISPR gene drives offer an opportunity to chart a new course.
For starters, public notification and broadly inclusive discussions should always precede and inform development of gene drive interventions in the lab.
A clear description of the potential impact of an experiment – as my colleagues and I have provided for the technology as a whole – must be followed by transparency throughout the development process.
This community-guided approach to research provides opportunities to identify and address potential problems and concerns during development.
If a perceived problem cannot be adequately addressed, researchers should be prepared to terminate the project.
Transparency and collective scrutiny would also help to ensure that scientists fulfill their fundamental responsibility to protect against laboratory accidents.
Experiments involving gene drive organisms are almost unique in terms of the potential harm that a mishap could cause beyond the lab.
Though DNA-level changes spread by one gene drive can be overwritten by another gene drive – an important safeguard against unwanted side effects and misuse – the ecological impacts would not be so easy to reverse.
To be sure, most gene drive experiments will pose little, if any, environmental risk.
Nonetheless, an accidental release would prove devastating to public confidence in researchers' ability to develop this powerful technology with wisdom and humility.
That is why my colleagues and I have detailed, demonstrated, and publicized several easily implementable confinement strategies.
Another feature of a responsible approach would be a commitment by scientists to evaluate each proposed gene drive intervention – say, immunizing mice so that they cannot transmit Lyme disease to ticks – individually, rather than making a blanket decision on the technology as a whole.
After all, the benefits and risks of each intervention would be entirely different.
A final safeguard against the irresponsible development of gene drive technology is to ensure that early interventions are developed exclusively by governments and nonprofit organizations.
Given the potential of financial incentives to skew the design and results of safety tests, keeping the profit motive out of the development and decision-making processes will encourage balanced assessments.
The bottom line is that existing models for technological development are inadequate for technologies with broadly shared effects.
Only with early discussion, transparent research, careful safeguards, and community guidance can we build a responsive model of scientific development well suited to ecological technologies.
Given the life-saving (and environment-saving) potential of CRISPR gene drive interventions, let us determine how to develop them – and when to decline to do so – together.
The Return of the Currency Crash
CAMBRIDGE – Currency-market volatility has been around for decades, if not centuries.
Wide gyrations in exchange rates became a staple of international financial markets after the Bretton Woods system broke down in the early 1970s, and mega-depreciations were commonplace later in the decade and through much of the 1980s, when inflation raged across much of the world.
Even through much of the 1990s and early 2000s, 10-20% of countries worldwide experienced a large currency depreciation or crash in any given year.
And then, suddenly, calm prevailed.
Excluding the mayhem associated with the global financial crisis of late 2008 and early 2009, currency crashes were few and far between from 2004 to 2014 (see figure).
But recent developments suggest that the dearth of currency crashes during that decade may be remembered as the exception that proves the rule.
The near-disappearance of currency crashes in the 2004-2014 period largely reflect low and stable international interest rates and large capital flows to emerging markets, coupled with a commodity price boom and (mostly) healthy growth rates in countries that escaped the global financial crisis.
In effect, many countries’ main concern during those years was avoiding sustained currency appreciation against the US dollar and the currencies of other trade partners.
That changed in 2014, when deteriorating global conditions revived the currency crash en masse.
Since then, nearly half of the sample of 179 countries shown in the figure have experienced annual depreciations in excess of 15%.
True, more flexible exchange-rate arrangements have mostly eliminated the drama of abandoning pre-announced pegged or semi-pegged exchange rates.
But, thus far, there is little to suggest that the depreciations have had much of a salutary effect on economic growth, which for the most part has remained sluggish.
The average cumulative depreciation versus the US dollar has been almost 35% from January 2014 to January 2016.
For many emerging markets, where depreciations have been considerably greater, weakening exchange rates have aggravated current problems associated with rising foreign-currency debts.
Moreover, in an interconnected world, the effects of currency crashes do not end in the country where they originate.
Back in 1994, China reformed its foreign-exchange framework, unified its system of multiple exchange rates, and, in the process, devalued the renminbi by 50%.
It has been persuasively argued that the Chinese devaluation resulted in a loss of competitiveness for Thailand, Korea, Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines, which had pegged (or semi-pegged) their currencies to the US dollar.
Their cumulative overvaluation, in turn, helped set the stage for the Asian crisis that erupted in mid-1997.
Overvalued exchange rates have been among the best leading indicators of financial crises.
So one cannot help but wonder if we are facing a repeat of what happened from 1994 to 1997 – only this time with the roles reversed.
Since early 2014, the renminbi has depreciated by a mere 7.5% against the dollar, compared to the euro’s roughly 25% depreciation in this period, not to mention even faster currency weakening in many emerging markets.
For a manufacturing-based economy such as China’s, the overvaluation-growth connection should not be underestimated.
China’s announcement last August of its intent to allow modest depreciation and eventually move the renminbi toward greater exchange-rate flexibility triggered a roller-coaster ride in financial markets.
To provide reassurance, policymakers issued statements to the effect that China would move only gradually in that direction.
But perhaps the cautionary tale from the Asian crises is that gradualism on this front carries its own risks.
Of course, the potential beggar-thy-neighbor effects of the spike in currency crashes in the past two years are not unique to China.
They may also apply to any country that has maintained a comparatively fixed exchange rate (a category that includes major oil producers).
What distinguishes the Chinese case from others is the sheer size of its economy relative to world GDP, as well as its effects on numerous countries across regions, from suppliers of primary commodities to countries that depend on Chinese funding or direct investment.
The broader point is a simple one: Emerging markets now account for around 60% of world GDP, up from about 35% in the early 1980s.
Restoring global prosperity requires a much broader geographical base than it did back then.
The return of the currency crash may make achieving it all the more difficult.
The Currency Manipulation Charade
NEW HAVEN – As the US Congress grapples with the ever-contentious Trans-Pacific Partnership – President Barack Obama’s signature trade legislation – a major stumbling block looms.
On May 22, the Senate avoided it, by narrowly defeating – 51 to 48 – a proposed “currency manipulation” amendment to a bill that gives Obama so-called “fast-track” authority to negotiate the TPP.
But the issue could be resurrected as the debate shifts to the House of Representatives, where support is strong for “enforceable currency rules.”
For at least a decade, Congress has been focusing on currency manipulation – a charge leveled at countries that purportedly intervene in foreign-exchange markets in order to suppress their currencies’ value, thereby subsidizing exports.
In 2005, Senators Charles Schumer, a liberal Democrat from New York, and Lindsey Graham, a conservative Republican from South Carolina, formed an unlikely alliance to defend beleaguered middle-class US workers from supposedly unfair competitive practices.
Stop the currency manipulation, went the argument, and America’s gaping trade deficit would narrow – providing lasting and meaningful benefits to hard-pressed workers.
A decade ago, the original Schumer-Graham proposal was a thinly veiled anti-China initiative.
The ire that motivated that proposal remains today, with China accounting for 47% of America’s still outsize merchandise trade deficit in 2014.
Never mind that the Chinese renminbi has risen some 33% against the US dollar since mid-1995 to a level that the International Monetary Fund no longer considers undervalued, or that China’s current-account surplus has shrunk from 10% of GDP in 2007 to an estimated 2% in 2014.
China remains in the crosshairs of US politicians who believe that American workers are the victims of its unfair trading practices.
While this argument has great emotional and political appeal, it is deeply flawed, because the United States has an insidious saving problem.
America’s net national saving rate – the sum total of household, business, and government saving (adjusted for the depreciation of aging capacity) – currently stands at 2.5% of national income.
While that is better than the negative saving rates of 2008-2011, it remains well short of the 6.3% average of the final three decades of the twentieth century.
Lacking in saving and wanting to grow, America must import surplus savings from abroad.
And to attract that foreign capital, it has no choice but to run equally large balance-of-payments deficits.
So it is no coincidence that the US economy has a chronic current-account deficit.
While this shortfall has narrowed from a peak of 5.8% of GDP in 2006 to 2.4% in 2014, it still leaves the US heavily dependent on surplus foreign savings in order to grow.
This is where the trade deficit comes into play.
The US does not just pluck surplus foreign savings out of thin air.
To attract the capital it needs, America must send dollars overseas through foreign trade.
And it is here that the currency manipulation argument falls apart.
In 2014, the US ran trade deficits with some 95 countries.
In other words, America does not suffer from a small number of bilateral trade deficits that can be tied to charges of currency manipulation by countries like China, Japan, Malaysia, or Singapore.
Rather, the US suffers from a multilateral trade imbalance with many countries, and this cannot be remedied through the imposition of bilateral penalties such as tariffs.
Without fixing its savings problem, restricting trade with a few so-called currency manipulators would simply redistribute the US trade deficit to its other trading partners.
In effect, America’s trade balance is like a water balloon – applying pressure on one spot would simply cause the water to slosh elsewhere.
Moreover, this approach could easily backfire.
For example, assuming that there is no increase in domestic US saving, penalizing a low-cost producer like China for currency manipulation would most likely cause the Chinese piece of America’s trade deficit to be reallocated to higher-cost producers.
That would be the functional equivalent of a tax hike on middle-class families – precisely the constituency that so concerns Congress.
Further complications would arise from putting the verdict on currency manipulation – presumably dependent on some type of “fair value” metric – in the hands of politicians.
This is also the twist that underscores the ultimate congressional hypocrisy.
The charge of currency manipulation is nothing but a foil for the US to duck responsibility for fixing America’s saving problem.
Lacking any semblance of a strategy to boost savings – not just a long-term fix to the federal government’s budget deficit, but also meaningful incentives for personal saving – US politicians have turned to yet another quick fix.
In the end, there is no way around it: If Congress does not like trade deficits, it needs to address America’s saving problem and stop fixating on misplaced concerns over currency manipulation.
None of this is to argue that the US should ignore unfair trading practices.
As a member of the World Trade Organization, the US has ample opportunity to use that body’s dispute-resolution mechanism to adjudicate major problems with its trading partners.
And it has enjoyed success with this approach.
What Congress cannot do is pretend that wrong-footed trade policy is the answer to its inability or unwillingness to refocus its domestic policy agenda.
Of course, it is always easier to blame others than to look in the mirror.
But history has not been kind to major trade blunders.
Just as the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930 sparked a global trade war that may well have put the “great” in the Great Depression, Congressional enactment of enforceable currency rules today could spark retaliatory actions that might devastate the free flow of trade that a sluggish global economy desperately needs.
The US Senate was wise in rejecting this dangerous option.
We can only hope that similar wisdom prevails in the House of Representatives.
Currency manipulation legislation is one tragedy that can and should be avoided.
Securing the Digital Transition
NEW DELHI – Every year, the World Economic Forum publishes a Global Risks Report, which distills the views of experts and policymakers from around the world.
This year, cybersecurity is high on the list of global concerns, as well it should be.
In 2017, the world witnessed a continued escalation in cyber attacks and security breaches that affected all parts of society.
There is no reason to believe 2018 will be different.
The implications are far-reaching.
Most immediately, we must grapple with governance of the Internet as well as on the Internet.
Otherwise, the opportunities afforded by digital technologies could be squandered in a regulatory and legal arms race, complete with new borders and new global tensions.
But there’s a broader issue: For all the speed with which we are racing into the digital age, efforts to ensure global stability are lagging far behind.
In many respects, our world is still organized within a Westphalian framework.
States with (mostly) recognized borders are the building blocks of the international system.
Their interactions, and their willingness to share sovereignty, define the existing world order.
But globalization has gradually changed the realities on the ground.
And while its force – waxing and waning since the decades preceding World War I – is nowadays being tempered by geopolitics, and by the impulse to slow the pace of technological change, the digital transformation will propel globalization forward, albeit in a different form.
After all, the Internet’s key feature is its non-territorial architecture.
By breaking down traditional borders, it poses a direct challenge to the very foundation of the Westphalian order.
This is a profoundly positive development, because it facilitates free expression and the cross-border exchange of goods and ideas.
But, as with all human inventions, the Internet can be abused, as evidenced by the rise in cybercrime, online harassment, hate speech, incitement to violence, and online radicalization.
Minimizing such abuses in the years ahead will require close international cooperation to establish and enforce common rules.
There can be no solution in isolation, because no single government can tackle the problem on its own.
Over time, an alphabet soup of organizations has emerged to bring together the technical community, businesses, governments, and civil society.
And bodies such as ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers), IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force), and W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) now provide de facto governance of the Internet’s architecture.
But governance on the Internet is far more complex.
Here, the institutional landscape is both crowded and unsettled.
It is crowded because numerous actors are competing to shape the normative framework of cyberspace.
Many countries have multiple relevant ministries regulating online activity.
Websites and online services have vastly different community guidelines and terms of service.
Public- and private-sector developers determine the design of the Internet’s changing infrastructure.
And numerous civil-society groups are proposing their own sets of cyber principles, while international organizations attempt to develop multilateral agreements.
The landscape remains unsettled because intergovernmental cooperation has largely stalled, owing to conflicting priorities among countries.
Making matters worse, there are still too few dedicated spaces for different stakeholders to interact and devise operational solutions.
In the absence of mutually agreed frameworks, governments will tend to adopt short-term unilateral measures – mandatory data localization, excessive content restrictions, intrusive surveillance – to address immediate concerns, or as a response to domestic political pressure.
But by doing so, they could fuel a dynamic that heightens, rather than minimizes, international tensions.
Digital governance touches on everything from cybersecurity to the economy to human rights, and uncertainty about which laws apply in different jurisdictions weakens enforcement in all of them, leaving everyone worse off.
Moreover, measures to address one dimension can easily affect the others, which means that uncoordinated and rash policy decisions can have negative consequences across the board.
When I had the honor of chairing the Global Commission on Internet Governance, our 2016 report highlighted these risks, and called for “a new Social Compact” to ensure that the Internet of the future will be accessible, inclusive, secure, and trustworthy.
Progress since then has been limited.
Because efforts at the United Nations to establish global cyber rules have reached an impasse, alternative initiatives will have to drive the process forward.
Fortunately, the Global Commission on the Stability of Cyberspace recently issued an important “Call to Protect the Public Core of the Internet.”
And the upcoming Global Internet and Jurisdiction Conference in Ottawa will provide another valuable opportunity for policymakers to continue working toward solutions.
Such technical and legalistic proceedings are essential for shaping the global transition from the industrial to the digital era.
To avoid a legal arms race, policymakers will need to develop a smart approach to a variety of tricky issues, from mutual assistance frameworks for investigations to the role of domain-name administrators and service providers in addressing abusive speech online.
Achieving policy coherence across jurisdictions should be a top priority.
Doing so will require direct, sustained interactions among all stakeholders.
Only then can we create a framework to preserve the cross-border nature of the Internet, protect human rights, fight abuse, and sustain a truly global digital economy.
As Kofi Annan said back in 2004, “In managing, promoting, and protecting [the Internet’s] presence in our lives, we need to be no less creative than those who invented it.”
Westphalia is behind us.
What comes next is up to us.
Surveying the Damage of Low Interest Rates
WASHINGTON, DC – For years after the 2008 financial crisis, policymakers congratulated themselves for having averted a second Great Depression.
They had responded to the global recession with the kind of Keynesian fiscal and monetary stimulus that the moment required.
But nine years have passed, and official interest rates are still hovering around zero, while growth has been mediocre.
Since 2008, the European Union has grown at a dismal average annual rate of just 0.9%.
The broad Keynesian consensus that emerged immediately after the crisis has become today’s prevailing economic dogma: as long as growth remains substandard and annual inflation remains below 2%, more stimulus is deemed not just appropriate, but necessary.
The arguments underlying this dogma do not hold water.
For starters, measures of inflation are so poor as to be arbitrary.
As Harvard’s Martin Feldstein notes, governments have no good way to measure price inflation for services and new technologies, which account for an ever greater share of advanced economies’ GDP, because quality in these sectors varies substantially over time.
Moreover, real estate and other assets are not even included in the accounting.
The dictate that inflation must rise at an annual rate of 2% is also arbitrary.
Swedish economist Knut Wicksell’s century-old concept of a “natural” interest rate – at which real (inflation-adjusted) GDP growth follows a long-term average while inflation remains stable – makes sense.
But why should the inflation rate always be 2%?
And why aren’t services, new technologies, or, say, Chinese manufactured goods excluded from the measure of core inflation, alongside energy and food?
Given these shortcomings, it is worth asking if central banks’ doctrine of “inflation targeting” will suffer the same fate as monetarism in the 1980s, when policymakers obsessed over the supply of money.
As with inflation today, central bankers then had no credible way even to measure the quantity of money, let alone deliver desired monetary-policy outcomes.
We should consider the effects of large budget deficits as another dubious form of stimulus.
In 2017, economic growth in the EU swung up to an annual rate of 2.3%, after member states had finally reduced their budget deficits to an average 1.5% of GDP, down from 6.4% of GDP in 2010.
Apparently, the fiscal stimulus after the crisis was not all that stimulating.
By contrast, tighter fiscal policies in recent years seem to have had a positive effect.
Usually, a financial crisis gives rise to major structural reforms.
But neither the 2008 crisis nor the subsequent euro crisis, which was caused by excessive public debt, led to significant deleveraging or Schumpeterian creative destruction in the affected countries.
Clearly, the flood of government spending alleviated the need for difficult reforms, and allowed incumbent enterprises to shore up their positions with cheap finance.
Any chance at structural renewal was smothered in the crib.
Among EU countries, average public debt increased from 73% of GDP in 2009 to 86% of GDP in 2016, far above the ceiling of 60% of GDP set by the Maastricht criteria.
In Southern Europe, public debts are so large that they will depress growth for years to come.
And yet the past decade of ultra-low interest rates will likely prove even more pernicious than the years of deficit spending.
There is no telling when or where the next financial bubble will burst.
But we would do well to heed the findings of economists such as the late Charles Kindleberger and Harvard’s Kenneth Rogoff and Carmen Reinhart, and tread carefully.
After all, one can spot potential bubbles all over the place.
Real-estate and other asset prices are at record highs in much of the world.
And the value of bitcoin in circulation has increased tenfold just this year, to $170 billion, although the cryptocurrency’s underlying value remains dubious at best.
Ultra-low interest rates have also created such a scramble for higher yields that even a poor, mismanaged country like Tajikistan can sell Eurobonds.
For Tajik President Emomali Rahmon, that certainly beats seeking help from the International Monetary Fund, which would demand substantial reforms.
Thanks to low interest rates, Rahmon can continue to misrule his former Soviet republic as he sees fit.
The many other victims of ultra-low interest rates should be all too apparent.
Middle-class savers have watched the real value of their bank deposits decline annually at a rate of about 2%, and many retirees have suffered a real decline in their pensions, which are invested in safe assets and thus yield minimal returns.
The same is also true for many forms of insurance.
Insurers themselves seem to be doing fine, but that is because they have been cutting benefits to the point that their customers will soon wonder why they bothered to take out policies in the first place.
Even banks are beleaguered.
In advanced economies, traditional lenders are now subject to such a mass of regulation that they have had to withdraw from foreign activities.
Not surprisingly, less regulated intermediaries in the shadow banking system have stepped in to seize much of their business.
Traditionally, the banking business centered around attracting deposits and issuing loans.
But as a result of “low-for-long” interest rates, that share of banking has become ever smaller, and banks have had to charge ever-higher fees for various other financial services.
Moreover, low interest rates have diverted money toward less transparent and more speculative financial institutions, such as private-equity and hedge funds.
Such institutions thrive on cheap credit, which enjoys more favorable treatment than equity financing under most Western tax regimes.
The benefits of low interest rates have accrued not to the population at large, and certainly not to the middle class, but to billionaires – the top 0.1%.
The global wealth gap has widened significantly in the past decade alone, and especially in the US, where billionaires pay little to nothing in taxes thanks to special rules such as “carried interest.”
And under the new Republican tax plan, they will pay even less.
The question now is whether Western institutions are strong enough to contain the global plutocracy that low interest rates have wrought.
The Case Against Cash
CAMBRIDGE – The world is awash in paper currency, with major country central banks pumping out hundreds of billions of dollars’ worth each year, mainly in very large denomination notes such as the $100 bill.
The $100 bill accounts for almost 80% of the US’s stunning $4,200 per capita cash supply.
The ¥10,000 note (about $100) accounts for roughly 90% of Japan’s per capita cash holdings at almost $7,000.
And, as I have been arguing for two decades, all this cash is facilitating growth mainly in the underground economy, not the legal one.
I am not advocating a cashless society, which will be neither feasible nor desirable anytime soon.
But a less-cash society would be a fairer and safer place.
With the growth of debit cards, electronic transfers, and mobile payments, the use of cash has long been declining in the legal economy, especially for medium and large-size transactions.
Central bank surveys show that only a small percentage of large-denomination notes are being held and used by ordinary people or businesses.
Cash facilitates crime because it is anonymous, and big bills are especially problematic because they are so easy to carry and conceal.
A million dollars in $100 notes fits into a briefcase, a million dollars in €500 notes (each worth about $565) fits into a purse.
Sure, there are plenty of ways to bribe officials, engage in financial crime, and evade taxes without paper currency.
But most involve very high transaction costs (for example, uncut diamonds), or risk of detection (say, bank transfers or credit card payments).
Yes, new-age crypto-currencies such as Bitcoin, if not completely invulnerable to detection, are almost so.
But their value sharply fluctuates, and governments have many tools with which they can restrict their use – for example, by preventing them from being tendered at banks or retail stores.
Cash is unique in its liquidity and near-universal acceptance.
The costs of tax evasion alone are staggering, perhaps $700 billion per year in the United States (including federal, state, and local taxes), and even more in high-tax Europe.
Crime and corruption, though difficult to quantify, almost surely generate even greater costs. Think not just of illegal drugs and racketeering, but also of human trafficking, terrorism, and extortion.
Moreover, cash payments by employers to undocumented workers are a principal driver of illegal immigration.
Scaling back the use of cash is a far more humane way to limit immigration than building barbed-wire fences.
If governments were not so drunk from the profits they make by printing paper currency, they might wake up to the costs.
There has been a little movement of late.
The European Central Bank recently announced that it will phase out its €500 mega-note.
Still, this long overdue change was implemented against enormous resistance from cash-loving Germany and Austria.
Yet even in northern Europe, reported per capita holdings of currency are still quite modest relative to the massive outstanding supply in the eurozone as a whole (over €3,000 per capita).
Southern European governments, desperate to raise tax revenue, have been taking matters into their own hands, even though they do not control note issuance.
For example, Greece and Italy have been trying to discourage cash use by capping retail cash purchases (at €1,500 and €1,000, respectively).
Obviously, cash remains important for small everyday transactions, and for protecting privacy.
Northern European central bankers who favor the status quo like to quote Russian novelist Fyodor Dostoevsky: “Money is coined liberty.”
Of course, Dostoevsky was referring to life in a mid-nineteenth century czarist prison, not a modern liberal state.
Still, the northern Europeans have a point.
The question is whether the current system has the balance right. I would argue that it clearly does not.
A plan for reining in paper currency should be guided by three principles.
First, it is important to allow ordinary citizens to continue using cash for convenience and to make reasonable-size anonymous purchases, while undermining the business models of those engaged in large, repeated anonymous transactions on a wholesale level.
Second, any plan should move very gradually (think a decade or two), to allow adaptations and mid-course corrections as unexpected problems arise.
And, third, reforms must be sensitive to the needs of low-income households, especially those that are unbanked.
In my new book, The Curse of Cash, I offer a plan that involves very gradually phasing out large notes, while leaving small notes ($10 and below) in circulation indefinitely.
The plan provides for financial inclusion by offering low-income households free debit accounts, which could also be used to make government transfer payments.
This last step is one that some countries, such as Denmark and Sweden, have already taken.
Scaling back paper currency would hardly end crime and tax evasion; but it would force the underground economy to employ riskier and less liquid payment devices.
Cash may seem like a small, unimportant thing in today’s high-tech financial world, but the benefits of phasing out most paper currency are a lot larger than you might think.
Restructuring Debt in the Dark
CAMBRIDGE – As the Annual Meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank begin in Washington, DC, one member country is conspicuously absent: Venezuela.
Yet there is much to be discussed about the country’s finances.
Indeed, a sovereign-debt crisis is inevitable.
All major sovereign-debt crises of the past – including in Mexico and Greece – have generated changes in the rules, jurisprudence, or strategies adopted by debtors, creditors, and international financial institutions.
Most recently, Argentina’s 15-year legal battle with its creditors – in which holdouts did measurably better than creditors who had years earlier accepted a debt exchange – destabilized the international financial architecture and generated a new set of rules.
Venezuela will be the first country to navigate the new rules; the country can ill afford to get it wrong.
Venezuela is in a severe crisis of its own making.
The government used the period of high oil prices from 2004 to 2013 to quintuple its external debt, expropriate significant chunks of the economy, and impose draconian price, labor, and currency controls.
As the price of oil collapsed in 2014, the government, having lost access to capital markets because of its profligacy, chose to continue servicing its bonded debt and default on its obligations to importers and most non-financial creditors.
The government also eschewed both advice and financing from the IMF, instead balancing its foreign-exchange flows by mandating the biggest import contraction in Latin America’s history.
This caused output to plummet over 30% (owing to the cut in imported inputs), triggered 700% inflation, and led quickly to widespread shortages of essentials.
Among other things, this unprecedented skewing of priorities led to a collapse in oil production, because the national oil company PDVSA failed to maintain its productive infrastructure and defaulted on payments to key contractors in order to pay its bondholders – thereby killing the goose that laid the golden eggs.
Venezuela’s lack of market access means that it cannot roll over its obligations, except under conditions that worsen its solvency, as PDVSA is trying to do.
Nor can it generate sufficient foreign exchange to pay its debts as they come due.
So, one way or another, Venezuela will need to restructure its existing debt.
A restructuring is ultimately in everybody’s interest; starving the economy of imports merely weakens Venezuela’s capacity to produce and repay.
But what tools does Venezuela have at its disposal to secure a cooperative solution with its creditors in a post-Argentina world?
And what role should international financial institutions play to facilitate an efficient outcome?
A critical component of successful debt restructuring is to ensure that similarly situated creditors receive comparable treatment.
But this is impossible unless the “holdout” problem is solved: if a majority of creditors agree to reduce or postpone their claims, it is always tempting for an individual creditor to hold out for full payment by free riding on other creditors’ pain.
That is why bankruptcy courts and bonds with collective-action clauses (CACs) seek to impose on all bondholders, including potential holdouts, agreements accepted by a qualified majority of creditors.
Two things happened in Argentina.
First, the defaulted sovereign bonds did not have CACs, so there was no way to force holdouts to accept the initial deal.
More important, years later, US courts accepted a novel interpretation of the pari passu clause advanced by holdout creditors (and rejected by virtually all other mainstream participants and practitioners in sovereign finance).
As a result, Argentina was barred from making a current interest payment to holders of its restructured debt unless it simultaneously paid the holdouts the full amount of principal and interest contractually owed to them.
Restructuring in the post-Argentina world is made more challenging because the holdouts’ success in that case means that bondholders inclined to negotiate a solution will have to explain to their own investors why they are not pursuing the potentially more lucrative holdout strategy.
Venezuela’s debt is different.
About 60% of the country’s public foreign debt consists of bonds, with about half issued by the government and half by PDVSA.
With few exceptions, government bonds have CACs, making it somewhat easier to address the holdout problem.
PDVSA bonds have all been issued in the US and, as legally required of all corporate bonds, they do not contain CACs.
PDVSA may nonetheless be entitled to bankruptcy protection both in Venezuela and in the US.
In this event, PDVSA could obtain a court-mandated standstill order with respect to legal action against it until a restructuring agreement is reached, thereby avoiding a disorderly seizure of assets.
As an additional form of pressure to secure participation, PDVSA’s exclusive right to exploit Venezuela’s hydrocarbon reserves can be withdrawn or modified.
(Interestingly, both of these possibilities are highlighted as “risk factors” in the offering documents for PDVSA’s bonds.)
Both PDVSA and the government can also use “exit consents”: changing some of the bonds’ terms – the pari passu clause used by Argentina holdouts, as well as other significant provisions – through agreement with a simple majority of PDVSA bondholders and two-thirds of holders of most government bonds.
Venezuela could further distinguish itself from Argentina by committing to a strong reform program and seeking IMF support.
Under the IMF’s exceptional access facility, Venezuela would potentially be eligible for more than $70 billion of new finance to support its reform program.
And this backing should help to win strong support from its creditors.
In this context, the IMF and major governments should support Venezuela’s decision to treat would-be holdouts no better than creditors with which it reaches agreement.
Defaults stemming from an unwillingness to pay do not deserve international support.
But when a debtor is unable to pay, nothing is gained by forcing payment.
When a significant number of holdouts insist on being paid in full, it becomes impossible to design an effective restructuring, unless other creditors reduce or defer their claims.
This is the definition of free riding.
No strategy to undermine holdouts can also mean no restructuring at all, which could mean chaos or even a failed state.
Neither outcome would serve the interests of the international financial community or the Venezuelan people.
Liberals to the Barricades
SANTIAGO – From Austria, France and the United States, to Poland, the Philippines, and Peru, illiberal populists are on the rise.
Some blame runaway globalization; others blame income inequality; still others blame out-of-touch elites who simply don’t get it.
Such explanations – however plausible they may be – miss the larger point.
The problem is political, not just economic.
Liberal democracy is humankind’s greatest political achievement.
Yet liberal democrats around the world are reluctant to make the case for it.
No wonder they are losing the battle for citizens’ hearts and minds.
The problem is far from new.
In fact, it is at the very root of liberalism.
Wary of censorship or oppression, liberal thinkers have more often than not espoused moral neutrality: they do not advocate a single set of values, or a particular definition of what constitutes a good life.
A liberal society – almost by definition – enables its citizens to lead any life they wish, as long as third parties suffer no harm.
The problem is that politics everywhere is Aristotelian: concerned with virtue.
Americans refer to their presidency as a bully pulpit with good reason.
When politicians advocate a particular set of values – or virtues – voters listen.
This can be done clumsily, as when John Kerry accepted the Democratic Party’s presidential nomination in 2004 with a speech that repeated the word “value” or “values” 32 times.
But it can also be done magisterially, as when Robert F. Kennedy Jr. chided Americans for surrendering “personal excellence and community values in the mere accumulation of material things.”
GDP, he memorably added, “measures everything (...) except that which makes life worthwhile.”
Philosophers from John Stuart Mill to John Rawls to Martha Nussbaum have sought a way out of liberalism’s quandary.
It would be discriminatory and illiberal to promote, much less impose, a particular group’s values, religious or otherwise.
But governments and political leaders can and should advocate the shared values – what Rawls called the “overlapping consensus” – that define a liberal society.
By commemorating Martin Luther King Jr.’s birthday, for example, the US both underscores and rededicates itself to the shared ideal of racial equality.
It was King himself who arguably provided the best example of the passion with which such ideals can (and should) be defended.
There are too few like him.
Populists like Donald Trump and French National Front leader Marine Le Pen use passion in the service of a politics of fear and hatred.
By contrast, liberal democrats, products of the Enlightenment all, advocate for their political ideals – which value human reason above base emotions – in a tone best suited to small, polite gatherings.
This is a serious problem.
“Ceding the terrain of emotion-shaping to anti-liberal forces,” writes Nussbaum, “gives them a huge advantage in the people’s hearts and risks making people think of liberal values as tepid and boring.”
Reason and emotion, neuroscientists like Steven Pinker tell us, are two sides of the same mental coin.
Likewise, cognitive linguist George Lakoff, drawing on work by psychologist Drew Westen, concludes that “emotion is both central and legitimate in political persuasion.
Its use is not an illicit appeal to irrationality, as Enlightenment thought would have it.
The proper emotions are rational.”
King understood this very well when he proclaimed his “dream” of a society in which his children would “not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.”
Today, US President Barack Obama is the only liberal democratic leader who speaks the language of values and virtue.
Obama is often criticized for being cool and aloof, and yet there is nothing of the sort in his promotion of the capacity to live together in peace and mutual respect as the most admirable liberal virtue of all.
“Each of us has deeply held beliefs,” he said in his victory speech in 2012. “And when we go through tough times, when we make big decisions as a country, it necessarily stirs passions, stirs up controversy,” which he called “a mark of our liberty.”
And yet, “despite all our differences, most of us share certain hopes for America’s future...We believe in a generous America, in a compassionate America, in a tolerant America open to the dreams of an immigrant's daughter who studies in our schools and pledges to our flag.”
That last line reveals that Obama is also aware of the other challenge liberal democracies must overcome: to shape a credible us.
The populists’ example is again telling.
Right-wing populists such as Trump engage in identity politics.
Left-wing populists such as Bernie Sanders engage in income politics.
Whether it is Chinese exporters, Mexican immigrants, presumed Islamic terrorists, or greedy Wall Street bankers, “there is,” as Harvard’s Dani Rodrik recently stressed, “a clear ‘other’ toward which anger can be directed.”
Liberal democrats need to make it clear that we get nowhere by blaming others, and that assuming shared responsibility is the only way to build a better shared future.
Of course economic and political reforms that reduce inequality of income and power are indispensable, both for their own sake and to make appeals to shared sacrifice credible.
Yet just as indispensable is the moral conviction, passionately expressed, that the “immigrant's daughter who studies in our schools” is a genuine member, with full rights, of that common us.
No social or political organization in human history has come closer than liberal democracy to realizing the ideal of equal opportunity for all.
We are not there yet.
But we have come a long way, and by sticking with liberal-democratic values we will go a longer way yet.
No jihadist or bigot, no Trump or Le Pen, no Chávez, Maduro, or Putin, should be allowed to destroy this possible dream.
In Defense of Economic Populism
CAMBRIDGE – Populists abhor restraints on the political executive.
Since they claim to represent “the people” writ large, they regard limits on their exercise of power as necessarily undermining the popular will.
Such constraints can only serve the “enemies of the people” – minorities and foreigners (for right-wing populists) or financial elites (in the case of left-wing populists).
This is a dangerous approach to politics, because it allows a majority to ride roughshod over the rights of minorities.
Without separation of powers, an independent judiciary, or free media – which all populist autocrats, from Vladimir Putin and Recep Tayyip Erdoğan to Viktor Orbán and Donald Trump detest – democracy degenerates into the tyranny of whoever happens to be in power.
Periodic elections under populist rule become a smokescreen.
In the absence of the rule of law and basic civil liberties, populist regimes can prolong their rule by manipulating the media and the judiciary at will.
Populists’ aversion to institutional restraints extends to the economy, where exercising full control “in the people’s interest” implies that no obstacles should be placed in their way by autonomous regulatory agencies, independent central banks, or global trade rules.
But while populism in the political domain is almost always harmful, economic populism can sometimes be justified.
Start with why restraints on economic policy may be desirable in the first place.
Economists tend to have a soft spot for such restraints, because policymaking that is fully responsive to the push and pull of domestic politics can generate highly inefficient outcomes.
In particular, economic policy is often subject to the problem of what economists call time-inconsistency: short-term interests frequently undermine the pursuit of policies that are far more desirable in the long term.
A canonical example is discretionary monetary policy.
Politicians who have the power to print money at will may generate “surprise inflation” to boost output and employment in the short run – say, before an election.
But this backfires, because firms and households adjust their inflation expectations.
In the end, discretionary monetary policy results only in higher inflation without yielding any output or employment gains.
The solution is an independent central bank, insulated from politics, operating solely on its mandate to maintain price stability.
The costs of macroeconomic populism are familiar from Latin America.
As Jeffrey D. Sachs, Sebastián Edwards, and Rüdiger Dornbusch argued years ago, unsustainable monetary and fiscal policies were the bane of the region until economic orthodoxy began to prevail in the 1990s.
Populist policies periodically produced painful economic crises, which hurt the poor the most.
To break this cycle, the region turned to fiscal rules and technocratic finance ministers.
Another example is official treatment of foreign investors.
Once a foreign firm makes its investment, it essentially becomes captive to the host government’s whims.
Promises that were made to attract the firm are easily forgotten, replaced by policies that squeeze it to the benefit of the national budget or domestic companies.
But investors are not stupid, and, fearing this outcome, they invest elsewhere.
Governments’ need to establish their credibility has thus given rise to trade agreements with so-called investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) clauses, allowing the firm to sue the government in international tribunals.
These are examples of restraints on economic policy that take the form of delegation to autonomous agencies, technocrats, or external rules.
As described, they serve the valuable function of preventing those in power from shooting themselves in the foot by pursuing short-sighted policies.
But there are other scenarios as well, in which the consequences of restraints on economic policy may be less salutary.
In particular, restraints may be instituted by special interests or elites themselves, to cement permanent control over policymaking.
In such cases, delegation to autonomous agencies or signing on to global rules does not serve society, but only a narrow caste of “insiders.”
Part of today’s populist backlash is rooted in the belief, not entirely unjustified, that this scenario describes much economic policymaking in recent decades.
Multinational corporations and investors have increasingly shaped the agenda of international trade negotiations, resulting in global regimes that disproportionately benefit capital at the expense of labor.
Stringent patent rules and international investor tribunals are prime examples.
So is the capture of autonomous agencies by the industries they are supposed to regulate.
Banks and other financial institutions have been especially successful at getting their way and instituting rules that give them free rein.
Independent central banks played a critical role in bringing inflation down in the 1980s and 1990s.
But in the current low-inflation environment, their exclusive focus on price stability imparts a deflationary bias to economic policy and is in tension with employment generation and growth.
Such “liberal technocracy” may be at its apogee in the European Union, where economic rules and regulations are designed at considerable remove from democratic deliberation at the national level.
And in virtually every member state, this political gap – the EU’s so-called democratic deficit – has given rise to populist, Euroskeptical political parties.
In such cases, relaxing the constraints on economic policy and returning policymaking autonomy to elected governments may well be desirable.
Exceptional times require the freedom to experiment in economic policy.
Franklin D. Roosevelt’s New Deal provides an apt historical example.
FDR’s reforms required that he remove the economic shackles imposed by conservative judges and financial interests at home and by the gold standard abroad.
We should constantly be wary of populism that stifles political pluralism and undermines liberal democratic norms.
Political populism is a menace to be avoided at all costs.
Economic populism, by contrast, is occasionally necessary.
Indeed, at such times, it may be the only way to forestall its much more dangerous political cousin.
Demographics and Development
WASHINGTON, DC – Achieving the ambitious Sustainable Development Goals – which aim to end poverty, boost shared prosperity, and promote sustainability, between now and 2030 – will require overcoming some major obstacles, ranging from securing enough financing to addressing climate change to managing macroeconomic shocks.
But there is one potential obstacle that could turn out to be a blessing in disguise: the diverse demographic shifts that will take place in the coming years.
By the time the SDG agenda reaches its end date, there will be an estimated 8.5 billion people worldwide.
Twenty years later – just 34 years from now – there will be nearly ten billion, or nearly 2.5 billion more people than there are on Earth today.
What will such a world look like?
Where will those additional people live?
How will they make their living?
Will they bolster or weigh down national economies?
For clues, we can look 35 years in the past, to the early 1980s.
US President Ronald Reagan, Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, French President François Mitterrand, and Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev dominated the world’s headlines.
Personal computer sales were miniscule.
And children competed over Rubik’s cubes, rather than augmented-reality Pokémon.
At that time, the world’s population was about 4.5 billion, 42% of whom – almost two billion – lived in extreme poverty.
Excessive population growth, it was feared, would outpace agricultural production and create yet more poverty.
Yet the Malthusian predictions were wrong.
Although the world population has surged to 7.5 billion, only about 750 million people – just 10% of the total population – live in extreme poverty today.
China and India, in particular, lifted hundreds of millions out of poverty in recent decades, increasing their citizens’ incomes and improving their health.
China and India achieved this partly by strengthening institutions and pursuing policies that supported strong, relatively inclusive growth.
China, for its part, also took advantage of a “demographic dividend”: fertility rates fell, and the labor force grew faster than the dependent population, freeing up resources to invest in people and capital.
This produced higher growth and living standards.
Such a dividend can run for decades.
And, for China, it has, though it is now reaching its conclusion.
For India and other developing countries, however, the demographic dividend is just starting to be felt.
In fact, fully 90% of global poverty is concentrated in countries with growing working-age populations, creating an important opportunity for rapid poverty reduction in the coming decades.
For example, in Sub-Saharan Africa, which is currently plagued with high levels of extreme poverty, children under 15 years of age account for 43% of the total population.
When these children are old enough to enter the labor force, the proportion of income-earners in the economy could be increased substantially, boosting average per capita incomes.
But not all countries are set to benefit from a “youth bulge.”
Between now and 2030, several middle-income countries will experience a decline in the share of the working-age population.
Among other things, this reflects the tendency, supported by empirical evidence, for higher incomes to impel households to delay having children.
Even here, however, the demographic news is not all bad – and not just because the shift from higher to lower fertility typically correlates with a shift from lower to higher life expectancy.
History suggests that there is a second type of demographic dividend – one that actually lasts longer and is more durable than the first – which emerges when the accumulated savings of an aging population produce a surge in investment.
Many wealthier countries have followed this path.
But reaping a demographic dividend takes work.
As the World Bank Group’s 2015/2016 Global Monitoring Report emphasized, countries’ policy responses make all the difference in how demographic trends affect the wellbeing of the population.
With the wrong approach, a surging youth population can be destabilizing, and a rapidly aging population can become a burden on economic growth and public budgets.
For countries with a growing working-age population, the key challenge is to generate a large number of productive jobs.
For those with an aging population, it is to improve productivity and adapt social-welfare systems.
In both cases, investment in human capital and an enabling environment for businesses to boost employment are essential.
Furthermore, countries should take advantage of differences in their demographic situations with appropriate policies on cross-border capital flows, migration, and trade.
More capital should flow to countries with younger populations – with their growing manufacturing bases and consumer markets – to support investment and employment growth; and more labor should flow to countries with aging populations, to fill gaps in the workforce.
For all of these policies to work, countries need to improve the effectiveness and credibility of their civic and government institutions.
Mitigating uncertainty, in order to avoid fueling instability, is also essential.
The last 35 years prove that a larger population does not have to be poorer.
While the increasing concentration of the poor in fragile and conflict-affected countries will compound the challenge of poverty reduction over the next few decades, this is no excuse for not ensuring continued progress.
We have the resources and knowledge to achieve far greater prosperity, equity, and sustainability.
The real challenge will be to use them effectively.
Understanding the Productivity Puzzle
LONDON – In all major economies, the so-called productivity puzzle continues to perplex economists and policymakers: output per hour is significantly lower than it would have been had the pre-2008 growth trend continued.
The figures are stark, particularly so in the United Kingdom, but also across the OECD.
And while it goes without saying that economists have many ingenious explanations to offer, none has yet proved persuasive enough to create a consensus.
According to the UK’s Office for National Statistics, output per hour in France was 14% lower in 2015 than it would have been had the previously normal trend growth rate been matched.
Output was 9% lower in the United States and 8% lower in Germany, which has remained the top performer among developed economies, albeit only in relative terms.
If this new, lower growth rate persists, by 2021 average incomes in the US will be 16% lower than they would have been had the US maintained the roughly 2% annual productivity gain experienced since 1945.
The UK exhibits a particularly chronic case of the syndrome.
British productivity was 9% below the OECD average in 2007; by 2015, the gap had widened to 18%.
Strikingly, UK productivity per hour is fully 35% below the German level, and 30% below that of the US. Even the French could produce the average British worker’s output in a week, and still take Friday off.
It would seem that, in addition to the factors affecting all developed economies, the UK has particularly weak management.
Some contributing factors are generally acknowledged.
During the crisis and its immediate aftermath, when banks’ efforts to rebuild capital constrained new lending, ultra-low interest rates kept some firms’ heads above water, and their managers retained employees, despite making a relatively low return.
On the other hand, new, more productive, and innovative firms found it hard to raise the capital they needed to grow, so they either did not expand, or did so by substituting labor for capital.
In other words, low interest rates held productivity down by allowing heavily indebted zombie companies to survive for longer than they otherwise would have done.
The Bank of England has acknowledged that trade-off, estimating that productivity would have been 1-3% higher in the UK had it raised interest rates to pre-crisis levels in the recovery phase. But they believe the consequences – slower income growth and higher unemployment – would have been unacceptable.
This argument has now been extended beyond the banking system, to the capital markets themselves.
Critics of central banks have claimed that a sustained policy of exceptionally low interest rates, reinforced by huge doses of quantitative easing, have caused asset prices to rise indiscriminately.
That has not only had adverse consequences for the distribution of wealth; it has also muted the ability of capital markets to distinguish between productive, high-potential firms and others that deserve to fail.
According to this view, a rising tide lifts even fundamentally unseaworthy boats.
This argument has some explanatory power, though it says little about the value added by highly paid asset managers and whether they really are prepared to put their money to work simply on the basis of a monetary-policy effect on relative prices, paying no attention to individual companies’ strategies and performance.
But the key question the argument raises is what to do about it.
Would it really have been preferable to tighten policy far earlier, to kill off weaker companies in the interests of improving productivity?
The BoE has given an explicit answer, and the other major central banks implicit answers, to that question. They do not think so.
A preferable approach to resolving the problem might be more vigorous use of the tools available to market regulators.
These authorities tend to focus more on investor protection than on the allocational efficiency of the markets they oversee.
Investor protection is important, of course, but as the Nobel laureate Eugene Fama put it, “the primary role of the capital market is allocation of ownership of the economy’s capital stock.”
A regulator focused on that objective would be especially rigorous in overseeing the transparent disclosure of information, and would seek to promote vigorous competition among companies and also, crucially for this objective, among investors.
It should not be acceptable for asset managers to earn extravagant returns for following a market benchmark.
There are, no doubt, other dimensions to the productivity puzzle.
Maybe we are not measuring output well.
As developed economies become more service-based, our measures of output become less objective.
In many service industries, outputs are effectively measured by inputs.
Maybe we are not measuring enhancements in quality, which may mean that output increases are understated.
Maybe we have reached a point at which the productivity boost from Internet-based technology has been cashed, and we need another technological leap to move forward again.
But one key challenge for central banks, as we edge toward the normalization of interest rates, will be to develop a framework for thinking about the impact of monetary policy on the allocation of capital.
The task is urgent, as the social and political implications of a prolonged period of no productivity or real wage growth may be very serious.
Indeed, arguably they have been factors behind the political upheavals in the US and the UK already.
Why Build Financially Inclusive Economies?
SEATTLE – The theme of this week’s G20 summit in Hamburg, Germany, is “shaping an interconnected world,” and when leaders get down to business, many of the highest-profile topics – climate change, counter-terrorism, trade – will take center stage.
But the attention received by a less well-known agenda item will be no less critical to ensuring global prosperity: digital financial inclusion.
Today, some two billion adults still lack access to even the most basic financial services.
Digital financial inclusion is about broadening access to the formal economy by making electronic financial tools – like debit accounts that people can access on their mobile phones – affordable and available on a large scale.
When the poor start using these services, two things happen.
First, they manage money more effectively – with new ways to save, make payments, access credit, or obtain insurance.
Second, they spend less time taking care of simple financial transactions and more on productive work or running a small business of their own.
Moreover, additional earnings and savings boost poor people’s resilience against financial shocks resulting from, say, an unexpected medical expense or a seasonal crop failure.
There is no shortage of evidence for the transformative effect of digital financial inclusion on economies.
In Kenya, for example, “mobile money,” which allows users to transfer funds by text message, has helped an estimated 194,000 households escape extreme poverty.
The breakthrough there was driven by changes in savings behavior and greater occupational choice, especially for women.
As more countries experience gains like these, the prospects for lasting economic growth improve dramatically.
One recent study projected that broadening access to digital finance tools could increase developing countries’ GDP by an estimated $3.7 trillion by 2025.
But, in order to capitalize on the promise of greater financial inclusion, effective policies are needed at the national level.
Last year, the G20 published “High-Level Principles for Digital Financial Inclusion,” which focuses on eight of the most successful strategies adopted by national governments around the world.
A new G20 report published this spring probes those strategies further, and shows how to turn principles into action.
China has been a leader in this regard, demonstrating how to strike a balance between innovation and risk.
When online payment services, like Alibaba’s Alipay, first emerged, regulators were faced with an entirely new category of financial provider.
Rather than impose a battery of rules up front, they watched and learned to see what types of regulations were needed.
This gave providers a chance to find their footing and evolve.
That approach helped Alipay to become the world’s largest online payment platform.
Regulatory innovations elsewhere are solving another key challenge: the lack of personal identification for new account holders.
This is a common problem in many developing countries, and has prevented hundreds of millions of people from signing up for financial services.
To overcome this hurdle, Tanzania and Mexico implemented systems that require nothing more than a phone number to sign up for the most basic accounts.
Programs in both countries have been successful; in Mexico, for example, more than nine million new accounts were opened in the first two years.
India, meanwhile, is launching a massive digital identification program that collects fingerprints and other biometric data.
More than one billion digital profiles have been created since the program began six years ago; today, more than one-third of those profiles are linked to bank accounts.
Yet the most recent G20 report also highlights some challenges.
For example, “interoperability” – the ability of customers to transact with one another even if they are using different platforms – is the norm in only a few markets today.
Government action to address this would help increase customer convenience and lower operating costs for providers.
Users with little or no experience navigating online payment systems would also benefit from the adoption of policies that improve financial literacy.
Overall, the G20 reports make clear that digital financial inclusion is a powerful tool for tackling poverty.
But wealthier countries can benefit as well, because digital financial inclusion, when rolled out well, increases consumer activity and trade.
The G20, under China’s presidency last year, made improving access to digital financial services a global priority, and it will remain so under Germany’s tenure.
This focus will help improve access to the global economy for the billions who need it most — especially the poor, the elderly, and women in developing countries.
The world is getting better at understanding the mechanics of financial inclusion, and the ways that digital technology can accelerate it.
This is great news for the unbanked.
But placing the topic on a summit agenda is not enough.
To keep the innovation going, global challenges need localized solutions.
As leaders in China, Kenya, Mexico, and many other countries have already discovered, an economy that includes everyone benefits all.
Disrupting Climate Change
DENVER – After a season of record-breaking hurricanes in the United States and floods across Asia, it would be easy to despair about the accelerating pace of climate change.
Yet, despite the apocalyptic omens, an energy transformation big enough and fast enough to curb the spike in global temperature remains within reach.
Better still, we do not need to wait for new inventions to implement the changes we need; the transformation can happen right now, with profitable solutions delivered by businesses and driven by markets.
Limiting the increase in global temperature to within 2º Celsius of preindustrial levels – the target set by the 2015 Paris climate agreement – will require decreasing reliance on fossil fuels, and changing how the world grows crops, harvests timber, and uses land.
New research by the Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI) shows that both outcomes are possible, and that, together, the impact can “positively” disrupt the trajectory of climate change.
According to our analysis, there are pathways for the future supply and demand of energy, and for how forests and land store carbon, that, if followed, will dramatically slow the pace of warming.
By accelerating the clean-energy transition that is underway, it is possible to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions below what would be expected under current consumption patterns.
This scenario is not as far-fetched as some might believe.
The world is already switching to cleaner energy, to electric mobility, and to smarter power and land-use systems faster than anyone, including experts, anticipated.
And it’s not the first time the pace of change has exceeded expectations.
In 1980, for example, AT&T hired McKinsey & Company to forecast the number of mobile phones that would be in use in the US within two decades.
The consultants predicted that by 2000, the US mobile phone market would support about 900,000 devices.
In fact, over 100 million phones were sold that year.
Today, the planet has more phones than people.
Solar and wind energy have suffered similarly flawed projections.
For decades, experts at the International Energy Agency and the US Energy Information Agency underestimated how quickly supplies from these sources would grow.
They consistently guessed low, increasing their forecasts only slightly every year, without ever catching up to reality.
But as clean-energy businesses innovated, the cost of production from wind and solar declined.
Energy became cheaper, and usage increased as a result.
Government models typically do not account for such expanding returns.
Another reason for underestimating the speed of today’s energy transition is that the scale is different from previous conversions to new technologies.
When people switched from burning wood to burning coal, and then to burning oil, the “new” energy sources came from very large capital projects, like coalmines, offshore oil and gas fields, and refineries.
The high costs of deploying these projects were then passed on to consumers.
By contrast, in today’s energy market, consumers have more control.
Consider how easy it is to install rooftop solar panels; it can be done in a single day.
Millions of small machines – photovoltaic cells, wind turbines, batteries, and smart appliances – are driving today’s energy transformation.
Each new device in this distributed system is cheap and pays off quickly, so experimentation is affordable, and the technology can improve rapidly.
The result is a huge field of global competitors, with faster innovation and new business models that are helping to achieve economies of scale.
The hardware of the clean-energy revolution has more in common with mobile phones and laptops than with mines and refineries.
Because it can be sold in very large markets, with scalable production chains and still-maturing technologies, the transition to cleaner power is happening faster than many experts predicted it would.
Still, not even a rapid shift toward “greener” energy will be enough to keep global average temperature within 2º of preindustrial levels.
To achieve that, the world will also need to take more greenhouse gases out of the atmosphere.
Fortunately, that, too, is possible.
By incorporating carbon-reducing strategies into agriculture and land conservation, more heat-trapping gases can be locked up in forests and soils.
But while the techniques already exist, success will require increasing the use of no-till farming, adopting permaculture principles, better managing wetlands, and using rotational grazing techniques, among other measures.
The power of markets to drive radical changes in energy and land use is great, but as the storm season of 2017 should remind us, the climate emergency we face requires vigorous and urgent action.
Transforming the way people acquire and consume energy, and use land, will require strong incentives and policy frameworks to set the course for success.
But don’t despair: there is still time to save our climate.
The transformation has already begun – and it will play out faster than most people expect.
The Madness of King Donald
WASHINGTON, DC – Much of America’s capital has entered a state of near-panic.
In recent days, President Donald Trump has been acting more bizarrely than ever, and the question raised in the mind of politicians and civilians alike, though rarely spoken aloud, has been: What can be done with this man?
Can the United States really afford to wait for Special Counsel Robert Mueller to wrap up his investigation (on the assumption that he’ll find the president guilty of something)?
That could still take quite a while.
The question of timing has become increasingly urgent, given the heightened danger that the US will deliberately or accidentally end up in a war with North Korea.
That risk, coupled with Trump’s increasingly peculiar behavior, has made Washington more tense than I’ve ever known it to be, and that includes the dark days of Watergate.
To put it bluntly: the worry is that a mentally deranged president might lead the US into a nuclear war.
In just the past week, evidence of Trump’s instability has piled up.
During an Oval Office ceremony to honor Native-American heroes of World War II, he offended them by issuing a racist comment.
He picked an unprecedented and unnecessary fight with the prime minister of the United Kingdom, supposedly America’s closest ally, by retweeting a British neo-fascist group’s anti-Muslim posts.
In an effort to win a Democratic senator’s vote for his pending tax-cut bill, he traveled to her state and told lies about her record (though the tax bill was so tilted to the richest 1% of Americans that no Democratic senator voted for it).
And he continued to bait North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, who seems equally unstable.
At the same time, both the Washington Post and The New York Times ran articles containing disturbing stories about the president’s private behavior.
Trump, it was reported, told people close to him that he considers the infamous “Access Hollywood”recording of him joking, off-camera, about grabbing women’s genitals to be a fraud, even though he admitted its authenticity and apologized after the Post released it in the final weeks of the presidential campaign.
Trump has also been revisiting his mendacious claim about Barack Obama having not been born in the US – the bogus allegation that launched his political career, which, under pressure from advisers, he’d renounced prior to the election.
He said in a tweet that he had turned down Time magazine’s suggestion that it would name him “Person of the Year,” because it wasn’t definite.
(Trump sets great store by such appearances on Time’s cover).
But a Time official said that no such thing had occurred.
The fact that Trump appears to have some mental disorder, or disorders, has created a dilemma for psychiatrists, politicians, and journalists alike.
The American Psychiatric Association has a rule that its members may not offer diagnoses of people they have not examined.
But, given what some psychiatrists see as a national emergency, many have broken the rule and spoken or written publicly about their professional assessments of Trump’s mental state.
The most widely accepted view is that he suffers from a narcissistic personality disorder, which is far more serious than simply being a narcissist.
According to the Mayo Clinic, such a disorder “is a mental condition in which people have an inflated sense of their own importance, a deep need for excessive attention and admiration, troubled relationships, and a lack of empathy for others.”
Moreover, “behind this mask of extreme confidence lies a fragile self-esteem that’s vulnerable to the slightest criticism.”
This definition is all too reflective of traits that Trump regularly exhibits.
Another view held by a number of medical professionals, based on how Trump spoke in interviews in the late 1980s and how he speaks now – with a far more limited vocabulary and much less fluency – is that the president is suffering from the onset of dementia.
According to the highly respected medical reference UpToDate, a subscription-financed service used by professionals, the symptoms of dementia include agitation, aggression, delusions, hallucinations, apathy, and disinhibition.
Numerous Republican members of Congress are deeply worried about Trump’s capacity to handle the presidency – an incredibly demanding job.
Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, rumored to be replaced soon, is said to have called Trump a “moron.”
Trump’s heightened erratic behavior in recent days has been attributed to his growing anxiety about Mueller’s investigation into his and his campaign’s possible collusion with Russia in the Kremlin’s effort to tilt the 2016 election in his direction – an investigation that could end in a charge of conspiracy.
(Trump appears to be the only significant figure in Washington who won’t accept that Russia interfered.)
And that increasingly bizarre behavior came even before the news broke, on December 1, that Trump’s first national security adviser and close campaign aide, retired General Michael Flynn, had agreed to plead guilty to one count of lying to the FBI in exchange for his cooperation with the investigation.
What made this highly significant was that Flynn is far and away the highest former official whom Mueller has “flipped.”
Indeed, the generous plea deal makes it clear that Flynn is prepared to name figures higher than he was in the campaign and the White House.
That’s not very many people.
It has already been speculated, with reason, that Flynn will point a finger at Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner.
But Trump’s several earlier efforts to steer prosecutors away from Flynn were strong signals that Flynn knows something that Trump desperately hopes that prosecutors won’t find out.
We may learn what that is fairly soon.
Meanwhile, American and the world nervously await Trump’s reaction to this latest very bad turn of events for him.
Trump’s Fiscal Follies
CAMBRIDGE – This year’s presidential election campaign in the United States is certainly unique.
Donald Trump has shaken up the way a campaign is run, how a nominee communicates with voters, and the Republican Party’s platform, with many of his positions deviating from GOP tradition.
But, on tax policy, Trump has toed the party line – and that’s not a good thing.
Of course, any assessment of Trump’s declared positions risks being rendered meaningless within a few hours.
He changes his positions with head-spinning frequency, repeatedly disavowing statements soon after making them.
After two days of insisting, absurdly, that President Barack Obama “founded” the Islamic State, he finally tried to play the whole thing off as mere sarcasm.
Even for a more typical candidate, promises made during a campaign rarely match actions taken once in office.
During his presidential campaign in 2000, George W. Bush promised to renounce nation-building adventures abroad, to maintain fiscal discipline, and to treat greenhouses gases as pollutants under the Clean Air Act.
Once in office, he did precisely the opposite.
Nonetheless, we cannot simply ignore candidates’ policy promises.
Otherwise, the national discussion would focus entirely on the current week’s poll results, which is not particularly valuable for helping voters make informed decisions.
This is why it is important to examine Trump’s recent tax proposal, which has four salient features – all of which amount to tax cuts for the rich.
First, Trump proposes to abolish the estate tax – a long-cherished Republican goal.
Trump, like his predecessors, tries to hide the fact that only the very wealthy would benefit from this change, because the tax does not apply to estates worth less than $5.45 million for an individual and $10.9 million for a married couple.
Second, Trump wants to cut America’s corporate tax rate sharply, to 15%.
In theory, there is some merit to reducing the rate, which, at 35%, is one of the world’s highest (and probably spurs companies to keep profits overseas).
But, as most tax policy experts will tell you, a reduction in the overall rate should be accompanied by moves to broaden the base.
In particular, the US should abolish deductions, such as those designed to encourage corporate debt and oil drilling.
Third, Trump would reduce the highest rate for personal income tax from 39.6% to 33%.
This is significant, but not nearly as large as the previous proposal to cut the rate to 25% – which, according to independent analysts, would have led to about $10 trillion in revenue losses over the course of just one decade.
Finally, Trump has proposed tax deductions for average childcare costs.
That might seem widely beneficial, but it would help only those in high enough tax brackets to itemize deductions – mostly households with annual income above $75,000 (median US household income was $54,462 in 2015).
The question of whether Trump’s tax policies would benefit him directly remains unanswered, because, unlike all other presidential candidates since Richard Nixon, he has refused to release his income-tax records.
What is certain is that Trump’s tax policies are fiscally irresponsible.
Indeed, there is no indication how any of his tax policies would be financed, and every indication that they would sharply expand the budget deficit.
The budget balance equals government outlays minus revenues.
It’s a simple equation, but one that Republican presidential candidates, including Trump, have seemingly had trouble understanding since 1980.
They propose large specific tax cuts, without specific spending cuts, and yet claim they will reduce the deficit.
Instead, they have produced record increases in budget deficits, particularly during the terms of Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush.
To be sure, Trump’s budget plans are still too vague – particularly with respect to discretionary spending, Social Security, and Medicare – to arrive at an informed estimate of their actual impact on the federal deficit and national debt.
But he may face pressure to become more specific as the election approaches.
And, judging by his tendency to offer pie-in-the-sky ideas, rather than realistic policies, it seems likely that he will respond to that pressure with more manipulation.
Fortunately for Trump, the self-proclaimed “fiscal conservatives” who preceded him have already established four magic tricks to use when making impossible fiscal promises – tricks that he is likely to imitate.
· The “Magic Asterisk.”
The candidate promises to cut taxes while balancing the budget with as-yet-unidentified spending cuts.
(This is basically what Trump is already doing, as he has specified no spending cuts.)
· The “Rosy Scenario.”
The candidate (or incumbent) forecasts an increase in tax receipts, based on forecasts that national income will grow faster.
One of the three economists who have signed on as advisers to the Trump campaign has suggested that, with Trump in the White House, the rate of GDP growth will somehow double.
· The “Laffer Proposition.”
Reagan, Bush, and others declared that their tax cuts would spur so much economic activity that total tax revenue would actually increase.
This proposition has been disproved many times, and the economic advisers to those presidents have disavowed it.
Still, the temptation to square the budgetary circle with this claim may prove too strong for Trump to resist.
· “Starve the Beast.”
After the other justifications for big tax cuts were proved wrong, Reagan and Bush fell back on the theory that the decline in tax revenue was actually a good thing, because it would force Congress to approve spending cuts.
Again, the key to this gambit is that the president never actually gets around to proposing the cuts that Congress is supposed to approve.
Perhaps it is inevitable for candidates to ignore the real-world constraints of domestic politics or international circumstances as they try to sell themselves to voters.
But they shouldn’t be able to ignore the constraints of arithmetic, especially not when the same sleight of hand has been tried before – with profoundly adverse consequences.
Flights of Unmanned Fancy
BOSTON – Few pieces of modern hardware have inspired as much excitement as the drone.
While nonmilitary unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) were initially marketed as purely recreational gadgets, it has not taken long for entrepreneurs and industrial giants to seize on the endless possibilities they offer.
Annual sales in the United States are expected to reach seven million units by 2020, and many are already predicting a future in which drones reshape our cities – through remote delivery of goods, airborne surveillance, or as yet unforeseen applications.
Yet one possibility has captured our collective imagination more than any other: the idea that drones will soon be moving people over cities en masse.
Might flying taxis one day pluck us from our front gardens and delicately plop us down outside the cinema or our favorite restaurant?
Before we mentally hail the next air cab, let’s consider what it would actually mean if the skies were filled with swarms of miniature helicopters ferrying people to their next destination.
Though drones will have many important uses in the future, I do not believe moving people around cities will, or should, be one of them.
The dream of unmanned aerial transportation is not new.
When Fritz Lang created the futuristic cityscape for his groundbreaking 1927 film, Metropolis, he filled its skies with vertiginous towers and compact flying vehicles.
Then, in the early 1960s, the Hanna-Barbera animation studio produced The Jetsons, a cartoon series following the escapades of a futuristic all-American family.
In the opening credits the family whizzes around Orbit City in a hover car that folds up into a briefcase, which George, the family patriarch, then carries into his office.
In 1982, the science-fiction blockbuster Blade Runner featured flying police cars called “spinners.”
Today, a version of such make-believe futures would seem tantalizingly within reach.
Uber is investing in flying car technology.
Earlier this year, Airbus launched Pop.Up, a vertical takeoff and landing concept vehicle for personal mobility.
And in a venture that promises “flight for all,” German start-up Volocopter has designed the 2X, a miniature helicopter with 18 rotors that will begin test flights in Dubai later this year.
All of this suggests that urbanites will soon be zipping around urban airspace like George Jetson, right?
Wrong.
Despite big investments and bigger promises, there are physical and practical reasons why it is highly unlikely that our cities will be filled with airborne people movers anytime soon.
First, let’s consider the physics.
Anyone who has stood near a helicopter taking off will understand that a lot of energy is required to lift a heavy object vertically into the air.
Drone rotors are essentially big fans, pushing air down to create upward propulsion.
There is no way to achieve lift without creating a vast amount of both noise and air disturbance.
Residents of New York City know this well.
Complaints about noise from one of the city’s main helipads on the Hudson River led to increased regulation of tour operators.
Yet, even before that legislation, there were fewer than 5,000 tourist flights per month.
Imagine if all of the city’s eight million residents took even one flight every few weeks: the city would become unlivable.
Other factors that should curb our enthusiasm are more technological.
Even with dramatically improved batteries extending drones’ range, the crush of vehicles needed to move large numbers of people overhead would present a daunting safety hazard.
Modern cars may be dangerous, but a dead battery or a broken rotor blade in a flying taxi would cause a heavy vehicle to fall onto a densely populated area.
And we still don’t know whether such drones could be protected from hackers, terrorists, or other criminals, or how air traffic control systems might guide people safely.
Drones will still have a transformative impact on how future populations live, do business, and interact.
Small UAVs have already proven their potential across diverse fields – from humanitarian-aid delivery to security.
Drones transcend geographical barriers without the need for large-scale physical infrastructure, and can bring isolated communities into close contact with the rest of the world.
In Brazil, for example, the government is deploying camera-equipped drones to inspect remote agricultural producers suspected of breaking labor laws.
And drones are already monitoring air quality and providing support during health emergencies.
But urban mobility is not an appropriate application for UAV technology.
The problems of mass transportation can be fixed with our feet planted firmly on the ground – and long before flying taxis are even a viable alternative.
With improvements to digital networks and real-time data, autonomous cars, trucks, and boats – like the Roboat that colleagues and I are prototyping in Amsterdam – can be made fast and effective enough for all our needs.
And staying on the ground will obviate the need for networks of new infrastructure, like costly “vertiports.”
Society’s enduring dream of whizzing over a city in private flying cars has long captured the imagination of filmmakers – and now even some investors.
For practical reasons large and small, however, it is a vision that will remain the stuff of fantasy.
Bob Dylan and the Literary Idiot Wind
PARIS – Oh, the anger of the fusty at the announcement of Bob Dylan’s Nobel Prize!
What an outcry from the academy – not the Swedish one, mind you, but that of the world church of literaturology.
The panic of the literary bureaucracy, ensnared in its certainties and steeped in its petty calculations, its half-baked prognostications, its crafty shifts of position, has been palpable.
Was the choice of Dylan political or non-political?
Why an American? Why not a woman?
Or a voice, any voice, of a visible minority?
Or this one, who’s been waiting 20 years?
Or that one, who’s given up hope?
The truth, however unpleasant it may be for the fuddy-duddies, is that awarding the Nobel Prize in Literature to an author who has written just one book is no more surprising than giving it to Dario Fo or Winston Churchill.
And here’s the even greater truth: to bestow it on one of our last popular poets, the distant relative of Rutebeuf, Villon, and all the minstrels and songsters of solitude and dereliction; to consecrate a troubadour, a bard of the brotherhood of lonely and lost souls; to crown the author of ballads that have been, to borrow André Suarès’s phrase about Rimbaud, “a moment in the life” of so many people in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries makes a lot more sense than pulling out of a hat the obscure Rudolf Christoph Eucken or picking poor old Sully Prudhomme instead of Tolstoy.
Of course, it’s wrong to respond priggishly to priggishness.
But, confronted with those who have been shouting, “That’s not literature!
It’s just not!” one is tempted to side with Francis Ponge who, citing Lautréamont, defined the poet (he would say “proet”) as a bard or troubadour who, by expressing the “voice of things,” becomes “the most useful citizen of his tribe.”
And to whom does that definition apply better than to the author of “Chimes of Freedom” or “Long and Wasted Years,” which bring to life and to music what the critic Greil Marcus has called the “invisible republic” of American culture?
One is tempted to side also with Mallarmé, who urged us, in more or less the same terms, to “give a purer meaning to the words of the tribe.”
Again, who better than this collage artist, this chameleon of citation and intertextuality, this laconic lyricist, this verbal alchemist who spent his life reinventing others’ words and his own, uncovering the embers of the era beneath the ashes of the day’s defeats, and transmuting into gold the lead he heard on the radio?
Or consider the familiar distinction between scribes, who make instrumental use of language, and writers, who spin it into silk.
Wasn’t Dylan alluding to something similar when, after years of struggle for civil rights, resistance to the war in Vietnam, and support for the feminist revolution, he titled one of his most beautiful songs “I’m Not There,” as in, I’m not here anymore, no longer your servant, goodbye to all that, so long?
But the true question lies elsewhere.
The most conclusive exercise would be to compare apples with apples and the author of “Blonde on Blonde” with those who were and remain his key contemporaries.
Dylan is a Kerouac who can sing. He’s a Burroughs who put to music the great parade of the Beat generation, with its wild parties and naked lunches.
He is what Allen Ginsberg said in describing his shock upon first hearing “A Hard Rain’s A-Gonna Fall” in 1963, a song in which the accents and pacing, the abrupt changes in emphasis, the voyage to the very heart of words and the imagination all echo the best literature of the time – but with music as well!
Are we going to hold that against Dylan, charge him with the sin of having grafted the rhythms of the blues, soul, and country music onto those of the Bible, William Blake, and Walt Whitman?
Why should we withhold from the trouper of the Never Ending Tour (more than two thousand performances!) the dignity accorded without hesitation to the author of On the Road?
It was Louis Aragon, I think, who said that setting a poem to music was like moving from black and white to color.
Aragon, the poet sung by Léo Ferré and others, believed that a poem unsung was half dead.
Well, then, it seems that Dylan was the only one of his era to have been able to embody fully the musicality that is essential to great poetry, the second voice that haunts every poet, but which he generally delegates to those who recite or read him, the power of song that is his ultimate and secret truth and that some have gone mad – literally and tragically mad – trying to pull from cage into canto.
Bard and rhapsodist both.
A poetico-musical revolution in one man and one body of work.
I like to think that it is this tour de force – this prolonged stroke of genius that is forever young – that the Nobel committee has recognized in its selection.
Eastern Europe’s Authoritarian Return
MADRID – The European Union is a remarkable achievement of modern statecraft.
By building on shared values, it created a space of peace, progress, and freedom that overcame national enmities rooted in decades, if not centuries, of conflict.
But the emerging political rift between the EU’s Eastern and Western members, together with resurgent nationalism throughout the continent, is putting those values – and thus the future of European integration – to their most severe test yet.
In Eastern Europe, democracy is becoming increasingly illiberal.
Leading the way is Hungary under Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, who has been implementing his declared vision of an “illiberal state” for the last six years.
Now Poland is following suit, with Jarosław Kaczyński’s right-wing Law and Justice (PiS) party having moved swiftly to assert control over public broadcasting, the civil service, and the Constitutional Court since its election in October.
Already, the EU has launched an official inquiry into potential violations of its rule-of-law standards.
The move toward authoritarianism in Eastern Europe has been accompanied by outright defiance of EU-wide quotas for migrants, aimed at easing the massive refugee crisis that Europe now faces.
Meanwhile, Germany registered about a million asylum-seekers last year alone.
This split reflects a fundamental divergence in the two sides’ response to history.
Germany’s enlightened approach in matters like migration and civil liberties amounts to a direct rejection of its actions during World War II.
Though, as the Yale historian Timothy Snyder points out, collaborators in the “bloodlands” between Berlin and Moscow often supported the Nazis’ crimes, these societies lack Germany’s guilt complex.
One reason for this is that Eastern Europeans do not share in the legacy of colonialism.
The stepchild of empire – migration – is thus a problem to be handled by those who produced it: the old European colonial powers.
The countries of Eastern Europe – insecure newcomers to the fragile economic progress offered by EU membership – do not believe that they have any obligations in this regard.
But Eastern Europe does not simply lack the will to welcome migrants; it is actively opposed to doing so, in line with Władysław Gomułka’s maxim that “countries are built on national lines, not multinational ones.”
This stance, too, stems at least partly from World War II, as first the Holocaust and then the postwar ethnic cleansing of more than 30 million people, including virtually all Germans in the region, reinforced an aversion to multiethnicity.
Indeed, multinational states like Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia disintegrated without dictatorships to hold them together.
Historical memories die hard.
Poles and others who fell under Soviet rule after 1945 cannot forgive Western Europe for sacrificing them to Stalin at Yalta.
Nor do they see their liberation from totalitarianism as a Western European achievement.
Eastern Europeans’ gratitude lies elsewhere.
The Jewish Hungarian Nobel laureate Imre Kertész spoke for many in the region when he admitted an inability to shake off his emotional attachment to the United States, which liberated him from Buchenwald and later helped to free Hungary from Soviet Communism.
In Eastern Europe, the resurgence of authoritarianism – which prevailed in the region even before the Communist era – is propelled by an ingrained fear of being sandwiched between two traditional enemies, Germany and Russia, both of which are still viewed with apprehension.
To the PiS and the Polish right, the new Poland’s foundations do not lie in the non-violent Solidarity movement’s struggle for freedom in the 1980’s, which caught the imagination of the West; it lies in Poles’ heroic fight against the Asian Bolsheviks and the German hordes during WWII.
As Polish Foreign Minister Witold Waszczykowski put it, the “Europe of cyclists and vegetarians,” with its naive culture of political correctness and liberalism, represents a threat, not a model.
Conspicuously, when Germany’s EU Commissioner for the Digital Economy and Society Günther Oettinger first threatened to put Poland’s government under supervision for its takeover of the media and the Constitutional Court, Poland’s justice minister compared the scrutiny to the Nazi occupation.
And Kaczyński defiantly insisted on staying the course while dismissing threats, “particularly by Germans.”
This represents a sea change from the last several years, during which Poland emerged as the poster child for the EU’s eastern expansion.
If Poland leads an axis of wayward member states, the EU’s capacity to protect civil liberties within its borders, much less sway other countries, such as Russia – will be severely diminished.
And, given the lack of binding instruments to stop member states from moving toward authoritarianism, avoiding such an outcome will not be easy.
Europe is a continent saturated by history, and haunted by the specter of its repetition.
But if, as Mark Twain supposedly observed, history rhymes rather than repeating itself, the memory of the past should guide Eastern Europe, not take it hostage.
The past is a warning, not a destination.
An Economic Agenda for South Africa’s Next Government
CAPE TOWN – Almost two decades after Nelson Mandela was thwarted in his efforts to name Cyril Ramaphosa as his successor, African National Congress party members have now elected him as their leader. Of course, Ramaphosa is not yet president of South Africa.
But expectations are already high that economic policy will take a new direction under his guidance.
So what will a Ramaphosa presidency have to do to restore growth and ensure social progress in Africa’s lagging economic powerhouse?
Since the 2008-2009 recession, South Africa’s economy has stagnated, held back by leadership failures and plummeting confidence.
Unemployment has increased to 27.7%, the highest rate in 13 years.
GDP growth will amount to 0.7% this year, and stood at just 0.3% in 2016.
Public debt is rising, and real household income per capita has flatlined.
Inequality remains extreme, and social discontent is high.
The necessary commitment to coherent policies remains elusive, despite publication of a National Development Plan in 2011.
Collaboration between business and government leaders to strengthen key reforms and forestall credit rating downgrades floundered when finance minister Pravin Gordhan was sacked from President Jacob Zuma’s cabinet in March.
The worsening economic outlook has given rise to divergent prognoses.
Some insist that the hatches must be battened down: fiscal consolidation, curtailment of union power, deregulation of markets.
Others call for radical transformation: state-led industrialization, free tertiary education, land redistribution without compensation.
In the past, despite South Africa’s strident political discourse, strong leadership and stakeholder engagement enabled social partners to find common ground.
Today, however, the debate about reform is shallow and polarized, amid revelations of large-scale corruption and fraud in both the public and private sectors.
The resulting erosion of trust is jeopardizing already-complex nation-building and economic-recovery projects.
In seeking to restore political and social cohesion, the new ANC leadership will not only have to reinforce ethical principles in public service. Achieving inclusive growth while avoiding self-defeating fiscal deterioration will require hard economic choices.
Creating a more employment-intensive economy remains a primary objective.
Persistently high unemployment signals inefficiency in mobilizing human resources. It is also an obvious barrier to reducing poverty and inequality.
South Africa will introduce a statutory minimum wage next year, which will help to protect many vulnerable workers, and could lead to simpler and fairer outcomes than the current thicket of collective-bargaining agreements and sectoral determinations.
But, as the high-level panel chaired by former President Kgalema Motlanthe has recently argued, complementary measures are needed to support employment of young people and other vulnerable job seekers.
The existing subsidy for young workers, which operates as a temporary tax incentive to employers, should be extended to all low-wage employees in registered employment.
Originally proposed by Professor Sam Bowles of the University of Massachusetts to South Africa’s labor market commission 20 years ago, this remains the most compelling market-based option for addressing apartheid’s structural legacy of unemployment.
Moreover, locally managed public works and community-based employment programs should be expanded, subject to the minimum wage and basic work standards.
Household income support should run on twin tracks: cash transfers, already well-established, and basic employment assurance, which lags well behind needs.
Active labor market interventions and the envisaged public employment services should be structured as public-private partnerships, building on the demonstrated success of established independent initiatives.
Similarly, planning, oversight, and financing of technical and vocational education require effective collaboration among business groups, the national government, and municipalities.
Beyond these institutional reforms, South Africa needs more rapid investment in cities, urban infrastructure and housing.
Urbanization is a powerful determinant of productivity growth and improved livelihoods.
South Africa’s cities are still racially fragmented and spatially inefficient. Too many people still live in informal settlements, often far from available work opportunities.
The revenue systems needed to invest in better housing, modern transport, communication networks, industrial hubs, and enterprise development require strengthening, but they are not dysfunctional.
South Africa’s cities are creditworthy. They have excellent universities and capable financial institutions.
Bolder urban plans, more inclusive development strategies, and more streamlined business processes would catalyze investment and strengthen self-sustaining growth dynamics.
Expanded opportunities in urban housing markets are imperative, but access to rural land and livelihoods are also important.
The Motlanthe high-level panel’s proposals include strengthening land administration systems in informal settlements and traditional council areas, and facilitation of the subdivision of agricultural land.
South Africa’s agriculture sector could expand employment and contribute to food security by strengthening partnerships between established commercial operators and emerging farmers.
The energy sector and air and rail transport are still dominated by state-owned near-monopolies, whose balance sheets are in trouble amid rapidly rising costs.
Competition and private ownership would relieve the state balance sheet of a large and troubling contingent liability.
More rapid progress in regional economic cooperation, across the public and private sectors, is another imperative – one that would benefit both South Africa and its neighbors.
There are growing financial, trade, and migration links among southern African countries, as well as shared water, transport, electricity, and communication networks. And yet the region suffers from a dearth of infrastructure co-investment projects, weak collaboration in trade promotion, and slow-moving cooperation in financial and tax arrangements.
Reform of the Southern African Customs Union is long overdue.
But perhaps the toughest test facing the ANC’s new leadership will be to reverse the creeping dirigisme that the country has faced in recent years, while steering bold reform.
For too long, both private investment and critical state programs have been impeded by misdirected bureaucratic efforts to promote black economic interests, and public management regulations that are impenetrable and impractical.
Of course, black socioeconomic advancement is central to more rapid and broad-based development.
And rigorous rules and audit procedures are required for honest and transparent financial management.
But South Africa needs instruments that facilitate activity and incentives that reward productivity, not barriers to investment or initiative.
If the ANC’s new leadership opens up economic opportunity, while putting an end to self-serving deal-making, confidence and growth will return.
The Global Economy in 2018
HONG KONG – Economists like me are asked a set of recurring questions that might inform the choices of firms, individuals, and institutions in areas like investment, education, and jobs, as well as their policy expectations.
In most cases, there is no definitive answer.
But, with sufficient information, one can discern trends, in terms of economies, markets, and technology, and make reasonable guesses.
In the developed world, 2017 will likely be recalled as a period of stark contrast, with many economies experiencing growth acceleration, alongside political fragmentation, polarization, and tension, both domestically and internationally.
In the long run, it is unlikely that economic performance will be immune to centrifugal political and social forces.
Yet, so far, markets and economies have shrugged off political disorder, and the risk of a substantial short-term setback seems relatively small.
The one exception is the United Kingdom, which now faces a messy and divisive Brexit process.
Elsewhere in Europe, Germany’s severely weakened chancellor, Angela Merkel, is struggling to forge a coalition government.
None of this is good for the UK or the rest of Europe, which desperately needs France and Germany to work together to reform the European Union.
One potential shock that has received much attention relates to monetary tightening.
In view of improving economic performance in the developed world, a gradual reversal of aggressively accommodative monetary policy does not appear likely to be a major drag or shock to asset values.
Perhaps the long-awaited upward convergence of economic fundamentals to validate market valuations is within reach.
In Asia, Chinese President Xi Jinping is in a stronger position than ever, suggesting that effective management of imbalances and more consumption- and innovation-driven growth can be expected.
India also appears set to sustain its growth and reform momentum.
As these economies grow, so will others throughout the region and beyond.
When it comes to technology, especially digital technology, China and the United States seem set to dominate for years to come, as they continue to fund basic research, reaping major benefits when innovations are commercialized.
These two countries are also home to the major platforms for economic and social interaction, which benefit from network effects, closure of informational gaps, and, perhaps most important, artificial-intelligence capabilities and applications that use and generate massive sets of valuable data.
Such platforms are not just lucrative on their own; they also produce a host of related opportunities for new business models operating in and around them, in, say, advertising, logistics, and finance.
Given this, economies that lack such platforms, such as the EU, are at a disadvantage.
Even Latin America has a major innovative domestic e-commerce player (Mercado Libre) and a digital payments system (Mercado Pago).
In mobile online payments systems, China is in the lead.
With much of the country’s population having shifted directly from cash to mobile online payments – skipping checks and credit cards – China’s payments systems are robust.
Earlier this month on Singles’ Day, an annual festival of youth-oriented consumption that has become the single largest shopping event in the world, China’s leading online payment platform, Alipay, processed up to 256,000 payments per second, using a robust cloud computing architecture.
There is also impressive scope for expanding financial services – from credit assessments to asset management and insurance – on the Alipay platform, and its expansion into other Asian countries via partnerships is well underway.
In the coming years, developed and developing economies will also have to work hard to shift toward more inclusive growth patterns.
Here, I anticipate that national governments may take a back seat to businesses, subnational governments, labor unions, and educational and non-profit institutions in driving progress, especially in places hit by political fragmentation and a backlash against the political establishment.
Such fragmentation is likely to intensify.
Automation is set to sustain, and even accelerate, change on the demand side of labor markets, in areas ranging from manufacturing and logistics to medicine and law, while supply-side responses will be much slower.
As a result, even if workers gain stronger support during structural transitions (in the form of income support and retraining options), labor-market mismatches are likely to grow, sharpening inequality and contributing to further political and social polarization.
Nonetheless, there are reasons to be cautiously optimistic.
For starters, there remains a broad consensus across the developed and emerging economies on the desirability of maintaining a relatively open global economy.
The notable exception is the US, though it is unclear at this point whether President Donald Trump’s administration actually intends to retreat from international cooperation, or is merely positioning itself to renegotiate terms that are more favorable to the US.
What does seem clear, at least for now, is that the US cannot be counted on to serve as a principal sponsor and architect of the evolving rules-based global system for fairly managing interdependence.
The situation is similar with regard to mitigating climate change.
The US is now the only country that is not committed to the Paris climate agreement, which has held despite the Trump administration’s withdrawal.
Even within the US, cities, states, and businesses, as well as a host of civil-society organizations, have signaled a credible commitment to fulfilling America’s climate obligations, with or without the federal government.
Still, the world has a long way to go, as its dependence on coal remains high.
The Financial Times reports that peak demand for coal in India will come in about ten years, with modest growth between now and then.
While there is upside potential in this scenario, depending on more rapid cost reductions in green energy, the world is still years away from negative growth in carbon dioxide emissions.
All of this suggests that the global economy will confront serious challenges in the months and years ahead.
And looming in the background is a mountain of debt that makes markets nervous and increases the system’s vulnerability to destabilizing shocks.
Yet the baseline scenario in the short run seems to be one of continuity.
Economic power and influence will continue to shift from west to east, without any sudden change in the pattern of job, income, political, and social polarization, primarily in the developed countries, and with no obvious convulsions on the horizon.
Giddy Markets and Grim Politics
CAMBRIDGE – Economic growth worldwide picked up in 2017, and the best guess is that the global economy will perform strongly in 2018 as well.
At the same time, a rising tide of populism and authoritarianism poses a risk to the stable democratic institutions that underlie long-term growth. And yet headlines seeming to portend political instability and chaos have not prevented stock markets from soaring.
What gives?
First, the good news.
Surely the largest single factor in the synchronized global upswing is that the world economy is finally leaving behind the long shadow of the 2008 financial crisis.
Part of today’s good fortune is payback for years of weak demand.
And the rebound is not over, with business investment finally picking up after a decade of slack, thereby laying a foundation for faster growth and higher productivity gains in the future.
True, economic growth in China is slowing somewhat as authorities belatedly try to contain a credit bubble, but many other emerging markets – notably including India – are set to grow faster this year.
Rising stock and housing markets may fuel inequality, but they also drive increased consumer spending.
Investors and policy wonks are also cheered by the resilience of central bank independence in the major economies.
US President Donald Trump has not only largely spared the Federal Reserve the not-so-tender mercies of his wee-hour tweets; he has also nominated highly qualified individuals to fill Fed vacancies.
Meanwhile, the German right has failed to pull the plug on European Central Bank policies that have helped prop up Italy, Spain, and Portugal, and the ECB remains by far the most respected and influential eurozone institution.
Elsewhere, things are pretty much the same.
In the United Kingdom, British Prime Minister Theresa May, early in her tenure, once took a swipe at the Bank of England, but quickly retreated.
As Mohamed A. El-Erian has noted, many investors regard central banks as “the only game in town,” and they are willing to overlook a lot of political noise as long as monetary-policy independence is upheld.
But while politics is not, at least for now, impeding global growth nearly as much as one might have thought, the long-run costs of political upheaval could be far more serious.
First, post-2008 political divisiveness creates massive long-term policy uncertainty, as countries oscillate between governments of the left and the right.
For example, the recent US tax overhaul has been advertised as a surefire way to boost corporate spending on long-term investment projects.
But will it live up to its billing if businesses fear that the legislation, passed by a thin partisan majority, will ultimately be reversed?
Part of the case for trying to secure bipartisan agreement on major long-term policy initiatives is precisely to ensure stability.
And policy uncertainty in the United States is nothing compared to the UK, where businesses face the twin disruptions of Brexit and (potentially) a Labour government led by the far-left Jeremy Corbyn.
Harder to assess, but potentially far more insidious, is the erosion of public trust in core institutions in the advanced economies.
Although economists have endless debates about whether culture or institutions lie at the root of economic performance, there is every reason to be concerned that the recent wave of populism is a threat to both.
Nowhere is this truer than in the US, where Trump has engaged in unrelenting attacks on institutions ranging from the mainstream media to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, not to mention adopting a rather cavalier attitude toward basic economic facts.
At the same time, the left seems eager to portray anyone who substantively disagrees with its proposals as an enemy of the people, helping fuel both economic illiteracy and a hollowing out of the center.
Beyond existential risks, there are near-term risks.
One, of course, is a potential sharp growth slowdown in China, which more than any other major economy in the world today seems vulnerable to a significant financial crisis.
Perhaps the number one risk to the global economy in 2018, however, is anything that leads to a significant rise in real (inflation-adjusted) interest rates.
Low interest rates and easy monetary policy have papered over a multitude of financial vulnerabilities around the world, from Italian and Japanese government debt to high corporate dollar debt in many emerging markets, and perhaps account for political support for trillion-dollar deficits in the US.
Admittedly, markets see little chance of any significant rise in global interest rates in 2018.
Even if the Fed raises rates another four times in 2018, other major central banks are unlikely to match it.
But market confidence that interest rates will remain low is hardly a guarantee.
A plausible pickup in business investment in the US and northern Europe, combined with a sudden slowdown in Asian economies with surplus savings, could in principle produce an outsize rise in global rates, jeopardizing today’s low borrowing costs, frothy stock markets, and subdued volatility.
Then, suddenly, the economy’s seeming disconnect from politics might end, and not necessarily in a happy way.
The Danger in Today’s Good Economic News
WASHINGTON, DC – As 2018 begins, things are looking up for the global economy.
Over the last six months, growth projections by official institutions like the International Monetary Fund, matched or even exceeded by private forecasts, have been adjusted upward.
But not all of the news is good.
To be sure, there are plenty of positive indicators to inspire optimism.
The eurozone Purchasing Managers’ Index for manufacturing hit an all-time high last month, and even Greece’s economy is finally growing.
In the United States, growth now appears likely to exceed the IMF’s October prediction of 2.3% for 2018.
In the emerging world, China seems to have staved off the risk of a sharp slowdown: while its economy is no longer achieving double-digit growth, its increased size implies that, in absolute terms, today’s 7% annual rate exceeds the 10% rates of the past.
Turkey, for its part, posted 11% growth in the third quarter of 2017.
Even Brazil, which experienced negative growth in 2016, is likely to exceed the IMF’s forecast of 1.5% growth in 2018.
As the real economy strengthens, equity values – which, for a time, seemed disconnected from fundamentals – are increasingly being validated.
The Financial Times Stock Exchange All-World Index rose by nearly 22% in 2017 – its best performance since the post-crisis rebound of 2009.
As the growth pessimism of recent years fades, some of the warnings that have been made in recent years seem to have become outdated.
Northwestern University’s Robert Gordon, for example, argued that the US economy was bound to slow down, because today’s technological innovations would not boost growth to the extent they had in the past.
Harvard’s Lawrence H. Summers got a lot of attention for his argument that the world risked sliding toward “secular stagnation,” because the interest rate needed to bring desired investment in line with desired savings was below zero.
Yet, while the zero lower bound no longer seems to be a binding constraint, there are potential causes for concern, one of which relates to debt levels.
With the advanced economies no longer needing to maintain extraordinary monetary policies, nominal interest rates are set to climb from their current historic lows.
As that happens, high debt levels could become problematic, impeding growth by triggering disorderly deleveraging.
That said, given low inflation, there is little reason to expect interest rates to rise sharply, and gradual monetary-policy normalization would not necessarily have negative effects on growth or inflation.
But there is another potential obstacle in the path of sustained recovery: the long-term decline in productivity growth has not yet been reversed.
Instead, the current boom seems to be demand-led, with private consumption being the biggest driver, though private investment, too, is finally starting to rise.
These trends have been accompanied by solid employment growth, which is welcome news, but cannot last forever.
In the longer run, economic performance and potential growth will depend on the supply side and, in particular, on a revival of productivity growth.
Techno-optimists claim that technology will fuel the needed gains, as the lag between digital capabilities and their applications in the economy shortens.
But it is too early to say, with any evidence-backed certainty, whether they or techno-pessimists like Gordon are right.
There are convincing arguments on both sides, though we count ourselves as cautious techno-optimists.
What is not really up for debate is that inequality within countries is rising fast.
While individual countries show different levels of inequality, its rise has been evident almost everywhere, with income and wealth increasingly concentrated at the very top.
This trend will accelerate as new technologies, regardless of how much productivity growth they generate, continue to increase the skill premium, shift income to frontier firms, and allow new types of near-monopoly, “winner-take-all” positions to develop on a global scale.
Herein lies the biggest danger in today’s exuberant headlines about growth.
Many believe that rapid growth can act as a virtual panacea for countries’ political and social woes, including the rise of populism and nationalism.
But if the benefits of rapid growth accrue to the top 5% or 1%, social tensions are bound to rise.
And the fact is that it will be difficult to develop policies that can reverse damaging political trends and promote more widely shared growth.
This is not to say that nothing can be done.
On the contrary, devising solutions should be a high priority, with the policy debate centering on measures that would help to create truly inclusive economies.
One such measure would be broad-based access to affordable and quality education, including skills upgrading and retraining.
The development of regulatory frameworks that encourage competition would also help, as would limiting tax-base erosion.
Public research should be funded in a way that gives taxpayers a stake in profitable outcomes.
Likewise, infrastructure investments should have explicit equity-related objectives.
The goal should be to attack inequality on two fronts: ensuring that pre-tax incomes rise in a more inclusive fashion and strengthening the equalizing role of taxes and transfers.
Given the global nature of markets, many policies will require international cooperation to be effective.
With issues concerning international trade, investment, competition, and intellectual property rights increasingly linked, global approaches that can address them in a holistic way have become vital.
Failure to achieve greater inclusiveness – a difficult but attainable goal – would stoke social tensions and fuel already-resurgent nationalism, producing disruptions that would ultimately lead to losses for everyone.
Yet today’s good growth news risks obscuring that risk, as it threatens to weaken the will to make the needed changes, leaving economies to rely on trickle-down effects.
Why Are Illiberal Democrats Popular?
BRUSSELS – The rise of “illiberal democracy” in Europe is one of the most baneful trends of our time.
These regimes are typically centered on a leader who concentrates power by overriding – and in some cases eliminating – institutional checks and balances.
Russia’s Vladimir Putin, Turkey’s Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, and Hungary’s Viktor Orbán represent three of the most visible manifestations of this phenomenon.
But what is really noteworthy – and dangerous – is how these regimes have been able to retain popular support.
Control over traditional media, like television, radio and newspapers, is of course one reason why these regimes maintain their electoral majorities.
But manipulation, or even outright control, of the media cannot explain the enduring popularity, borne out by opinion polls, of illiberal leaders.
The key reason for these leaders’ political success is that these regimes, despite positioning themselves as anti-Western, have followed the so-called Washington Consensus, which prescribes prudent macroeconomic policies and open markets.
Russia under Putin is the poster child for this approach, with the government usually running budget surpluses and accumulating vast foreign-exchange reserves.
Hungary has also followed a prudent fiscal policy under Orbán; and Erdoğan has done the same in Turkey since coming to power.
Public debt in all three countries is thus either already low or (as in Hungary) declining.
In two of these three cases, the regime’s liberal predecessors had lost credibility because they had led the country into a financial crisis.
Illiberal strongmen have nonetheless accepted the basis of the Washington Consensus – that prudent macroeconomic policies deliver better economic performance in the long run – and have usually delegated macroeconomic management to apolitical experts.
They have resisted the temptation to use short-term fiscal or monetary stimulus to increase their popularity, relying instead on identity politics to maintain electoral dominance.
The longer-run result has been relatively solid economic performance – and relatively satisfied voters.
This contrasts sharply with the approach of, say, Venezuela’s late strongman leader Hugo Chávez, who maintained popular support for 14 years by spending the proceeds of a long oil-price boom on generous social programs.
Now, with oil prices down by roughly half since 2014 – and no fiscal cushion in place to sustain imports – Chávez’s successor, Nicolás Maduro, is confronting a catastrophic economic crisis and escalating popular unrest.
Prudent policies thus amount to an efficient long-term strategy for regime preservation.
Europe’s illiberal strongmen have recognized that if overspending leads to a financial crisis and the need to seek assistance from the International Monetary Fund, their days in power will be numbered.
Prudent macroeconomic policies support growth, but they can work only if the economy remains relatively free.
Until now, neither Putin nor Erdoğan have matched their nationalist rhetoric with protectionist policies.
On the contrary, Putin’s Russia joined the World Trade Organization; and Erdoğan has never called into question Turkey’s customs union with the European Union, even though bilateral relations with the EU have gone from bad to worse.
The longer-term challenge for strongmen is to keep their illiberal political regimes economically liberal.
Over time, the temptation to hand over control of a growing share of the economy to friends and family becomes stronger, and corruption tends to increase, as the main game in town becomes developing political connections and currying favor with the regime.
When this happens, growth is bound to decline.
This long-run threat is now most evident in Russia.
Putin happened to come to power at a time when oil prices began rising from a historic low.
It was thus not surprising that Russia could grow strongly during the ensuing commodity super-cycle, which ended only recently.
Macroeconomic management during the oil-price boom had been prudent enough to allow the regime to withstand the recent fall in oil prices.
But now, nearly three years after the end of the commodity super-cycle, the outlook for Russia is bleak.
Living standards have stagnated; and the economy’s potential growth rate is widely estimated to be just 1.5% – a level implying that Russia will remain permanently poorer than the rest of Europe.
Turkey might have reached a similar turning point.
Erdoğan’s Justice and Development Party (AKP) inherited an economy that was rebounding from a deep financial crisis and had substantial growth potential, owing to ongoing urbanization and gains in the population’s educational level.
Until recently, the AKP’s government limited its interference to the domestic side of the economy, such as government procurement and infrastructure spending.
But, after last year’s botched military coup, the regime has empowered itself to seize businesses owned by those accused of sympathizing with the so-called Gülenist movement, which Erdoğan accuses of having masterminded the coup attempt.
Hundreds of businesses have already been seized and placed under the administration of Erdoğan’s close associates.
If this continues, entrepreneurs will stop investing, and growth will falter.
The problem is that once an illiberal regime has started down this road, it cannot easily re-establish a credible commitment to respect property rights, because the institutions that ensure this in liberal democracies, like an independent judiciary and a professional civil service, no longer exist.
Today’s European strongmen have retained popular support by maintaining the relative economic freedom on which long-term prosperity depends.
But as these regimes become increasingly authoritarian, their ability to keep voters happy is becoming more and more doubtful.
How Economic Populism Works
SANTIAGO – Now that populists are coming to power in the West, a conflict over the intellectual ownership of their approach is brewing.
Writers like John Judis claim that nineteenth-century Americans invented political populism, with its anti-elitist stance and inflammatory rhetoric.
Argentines, who gave the world über-populist Juan Domingo Perón, or Brazilians, who brought us Getúlio Vargas, might beg to differ.
Yet there can be no disagreement that Latin Americans have been the longest and best practitioners of economic populism.
In the twentieth century, Perón and Vargas, plus Alan García in Perú (at least during his first term), Daniel Ortega in Nicaragua and Salvador Allende in Chile, and many others, engaged in trade protectionism, ran large budget deficits, overheated their economies, allowed inflation to rise, and eventually suffered currency crises.
In recent years, Hugo Chávez and Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela took these policies to new lows.
What should the rich world, now undergoing its own bout of economic populism, learn from Latin America’s experience?
Make no mistake: judging by the track record of its establishment pundits, the rich world needs some lessons.
In Britain, Brexit opponents insisted that if voters decided to leave the European Union, a recession, if not a full-blown economic crisis, would be inevitable.
After the referendum, the pound depreciated some, but nothing much else happened.
Today, the British economy continues to grow.
In the United States, academic economists repeatedly warned that Trump’s economic plans were little short of lunacy, and in the aftermath of his shocking election victory, some prophesied immediate economic catastrophe.
Since then, the stock market has reached record heights, commodity prices have recovered, and forecasts of US economic growth keep rising.
Have the pundits been smoking something?
Or have Trump and pro-Brexit leader Nigel Farage abrogated the principles of introductory macroeconomics?
Nothing of the sort.
But to understand the effects of populist policies, one must first understand their logic.
In a classic paper, Sebastian Edwards of UCLA and the late Rudiger Dornbusch of MIT define economic populism as “an approach to economics that emphasizes growth and income redistribution and deemphasizes the risks of inflation and deficit finance, external constraints, and the reaction of economic agents to aggressive nonmarket policies.”
They add that populist approaches “do ultimately fail,” not because conservative economics is better, but as “the result of unsustainable policies.”
“Ultimately” can be a very long time.
Populist policies are called that because they are popular.
And they are popular because they work – at least for a while.
A sizeable fiscal stimulus in a sluggish economy produces a pickup in growth and job creation.
If financial markets turn bullish (as they often do), the exchange rate appreciates, quelling nascent inflationary pressures and making it cheaper to import.
And, as Argentine economist and Columbia University professor Guillermo Calvo has long argued, precisely because they are unsustainable, populist policies cause people to shift spending from the uncertain future to the present, when the going is good.
This reinforces the expansionary impact of the stimulus, which is particularly strong under fixed exchange rates.
So, eurozone countries: beware!
With consumption, credit, and employment booming and asset prices sky-high, a warm and fuzzy feeling of prosperity permeates society.
Populist leaders feel vindicated, and they are not shy about claiming credit.
Their approval rating can only go up – and it does.
Soon, teetotalers begin to warn that debt is accumulating too quickly, credit quality is deteriorating, inflationary pressures are incubating, and an overvalued exchange rate is doing lasting harm to exporters.
But the music is too loud and the dancing too lively, so no one listens to the warnings.
How long can the party go on?
One thing we know from the Latin American episodes is that the answer depends, first of all, on initial conditions.
Most industrial economies have grown little since the financial crisis.
Deflation, not inflation, has been the problem.
Yes, the unemployment rate has dropped considerably in the US.
But after so many shocks and so much technological change over the last decade, there is considerable uncertainty about how much unused capacity remains and where the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment (NAIRU) lies.
It could well be that the likes of Trump find that they can stimulate the economy for quite a while before obvious imbalances emerge.
The other thing we have learned is that debt, both public and private, does become a constraint.
But when and how depends crucially on what kind of debt it is.
Today, advanced economies borrow in their own currencies at near-zero (and sometimes negative) interest rates.
Even if the starting point is a high debt-to-GDP ratio, it can be a long time before growing debt triggers an emergency.
Just ask the Japanese.
What happens when financial markets finally get cold feet and stop lending?
Well, as the Nobel laureate economist Paul Krugman was at pains to demonstrate in a recent paper, an economy with flexible exchange rates and debt denominated in domestic currency will expand, not contract, in response to a foreign deleveraging shock.
(Of course, Krugman was arguing for fiscal expansion under a Democratic president, but the point still stands.)
Not even then do you get an immediate crisis.
In 1953, Perón sent a message to Chilean president Carlos Ibáñez, a fellow army general.
“My dear friend: give the people, especially the workers, all that is possible,” he wrote.
“There is nothing more elastic than the economy, which everyone fears so much because no one understands it.”
Trump, should he come to think about it, might stumble to the same conclusion.
Anti-populists in the US, the UK, and elsewhere must come to terms with the reality that bad policies pay off, both economically and politically, long before they become toxic.
Yes, the excessive private and public debt, the loss of export capacity, and the weakening of institutions harm the economy (and the polity) – but only in the long run.
If critics do not understand that and act accordingly, populists will have as long (and destructive) a run in the rich countries as they once had in Latin America.
Economics and American National Security
CAMBRIDGE – The National Security Strategy released by the White House earlier this month differs from the previous congressionally mandated strategies that have been prepared every four years.
The 2017 NSS is different because it emphasizes the role of the economy: “Economic security is national security,” the new NSS avers.
Much of the report is of course devoted to traditional aspects of national security: military budgets, alliances, and dealing with countries like Russia and China, which the new NSS calls “strategic competitors” (rather than adversaries). But the growth of the domestic economy, the role of international trade, and America’s new positive energy position also receive substantial attention.
President Donald Trump’s administration rightly points to its regulatory reforms and its recently enacted tax legislation as strategies for increasing economic growth.
A bigger economy provides the resources to build stronger military capabilities.
But that economic growth can translate into more effective national defense only if Congress enacts future increases in the defense budget, targeting those areas that are in greatest need of expansion.
Because of the sequestration provision of the Budget Control Act of 2011, the defense budget has been subject to across-the-board cuts that will reduce defense outlays to 3% of GDP in 2021, the lowest share of GDP since before World War II.
The Congressional Budget Office projects that defense outlays, relative to GDP, will continue to decline to just 2.7% in 2027.
Bringing that up to 5% of GDP in 2027 would add more than $600 billion to total government spending that year.
The NSS’s proposals for dealing with foreign trade combine some valuable initiatives with a false analysis of the causes of the United States’ trade deficit.
“[T]rading partners and international institutions can do more to address trade imbalances,” the NSS asserts. That is wrong.
Basic economics tells us that the US trade deficit reflects the aggregate levels of domestic saving and investment.
More specifically, the size of the US trade deficit – imports minus exports – equals excess of US investment over US national saving.
Because Americans spend more than they produce, they must import more than they export.
So, to reduce the trade deficit, households, businesses, and governments must increase their saving – obviously the preferred solution – or invest less.
But the NSS is certainly correct in noting that foreign governments hurt American interests by promoting and condoning the theft of US intellectual property.
At a summit meeting in 2013 at the Sunnylands retreat in California, President Barack Obama showed China’s President Xi Jinping the evidence that members of the Chinese military had been stealing industrial technology.
The Chinese accepted the evidence, agreed that stealing industrial technology was different from other forms of espionage, and said that the Chinese government would not assist in such theft in the future.
Since that is not enough to stop other Chinese theft of US civilian and military technology, the new NSS rightly stresses that the US government will take further steps to stop it.
When it turns to specific trade policies, the NSS emphasizes that the US will seek to “break down trade barriers and provide Americans with opportunities to increase their exports.”
This emphasis on increasing exports, rather than reducing imports, is a welcome feature.
Trade barriers erected by foreign governments reduce the ability of US firms to obtain the real income benefits from exporting products made in America.
But the report also criticizes a variety of other unfair policies pursued by China and other countries, without distinguishing between those that hurt American interests and those that, though “unfair,” actually help Americans.
Here’s the list: “Other countries have used dumping, discriminatory non-tariff barriers, forced technology transfers, noneconomic capacity, industrial subsidies, and other support from governments and state-owned enterprises to gain economic advantages.”
Non-tariff barriers to US exports clearly hurt US firms without doing anything to help US households.
The same is true of forced technology transfers, although the Chinese position is that American firms that want to operate in China voluntarily agree to transfer technology in exchange for the right to produce and sell in China.
Dumping – selling products at prices that are lower than the cost of production – clearly helps American consumers, even though it hurts American firms.
But that is not different from a technological development that allows some US firms to produce more cheaply, thus helping American consumers and hurting other US producers.
Although some economic textbooks claim that dumping by foreigners can force domestic producers to go out of business so that the foreign producer can then raise its price, there is no evidence of such behavior actually occurring in practice.
The Chinese are still maintaining excess capacity in some state-owned industries, leading to export sales at money-losing prices.
Like dumping, that, together with explicit industrial subsidies, is an “unfair” policy that nonetheless actually helps American consumers.
Looking ahead, the US government should focus on combating foreign governments’ trade policies – such as technology theft, non-tariff barriers to US exports, and forced technology transfers – that hurt American firms without any offsetting benefits to American consumers.
As an economist, I am pleased that the NSS has given substantial attention to the economic aspects of US national security. I hope that this emphasis leads to better domestic and trade policies.
The Economists Who Stole Christmas
ATHENS – To welcome the New Year with a cheeky take on the clash of economic ideologies, how might opposing camps’ representatives view Christmas presents?
Levity aside, the answer reveals the pompousness and vacuity of each and every economic theory.
Neoclassicists: Given their view of individuals as utility-maximizing algorithms, and their obsession with a paradigm of purely utility-driven transactions, neoclassical economists can see no point in such a fundamentally inefficient form of exchange as Christmas gift-giving.
When Jill receives a present from Jack that cost him $X, but which gives her less utility than she would gain from commodity Y, which retails for $Y (that is less than or equal to $X), Jill is forced either to accept this utility loss or to undertake the costly and usually imperfect business of exchanging Jack’s gift for Y. Either way, there is a deadweight loss involved.
In this sense, the only efficient gift is an envelope of cash.
But, because Christmas is about exchanging gifts, as opposed to one-sided offerings, what would be the purpose in Jack and Jill exchanging envelopes of cash?
If they contain the same amounts, the exercise is pointless.
If not, the exchange is embarrassing to the person who has given less and can damage Jack and Jill’s relationship irreparably.
The neoclassicist thus endorses the Scrooge hypothesis: the best gift is no gift.
Keynesians: To prevent recessions from turning into depressions, a fall in aggregate demand must be reversed through increased investment, which requires that entrepreneurs believe that increased consumption will mop up the additional output that new investments will bring about.
The neoclassical elimination of Christmas gift exchange, or even the containment of Christmas largesse, would be disastrous during recessionary periods.
Indeed, Keynesians might go so far as to argue that it is the government’s job to encourage gift exchanges (as long as the gifts are purchased, rather than handcrafted or home produced), and even to subsidize gift giving by reducing sales taxes during the holiday season.
And why stop at just one holiday season?
During recessionary times, two or three Christmases might be advisable (preferably spaced out during the year).
But Keynesians also stress the importance of reining in the government deficit, as well as overall consumption, when the economy is booming.
To that end, they might recommend a special gift or sales tax during the festive season once growth has recovered, or even canceling Christmas when the pace of GDP growth exceeds that consistent with full employment.
Monetarists: Convinced that the money supply should be the government’s sole economic-policy tool, and that it should be used solely to maintain price stability through equilibration of the money supply vis-á-vis aggregate production, the central bank should gradually increase nominal interest rates once summer ends and reduce them sharply every January.
The changes in nominal interest rates they recommend depend on the central bank’s inflation target and the economy’s underlying real interest rate, and must reflect the rates necessary to keep the pace of change in consumption demand and large retailers’ inventories balanced.
(Yes, it’s true: Monetarists are the dullest economists to ever have walked the planet!)
Rational Expectations: These Chicago School economists disagree with both Keynesians and monetarists.
Unlike the Keynesians, they think a fiscal stimulus of Christmas gift spending in recessionary festive seasons will not encourage gift producers to boost output.
Entrepreneurs will not be fooled by government intervention, and will foresee that the current increase in demand for gifts will be offset in the long run by a sharp drop (as government subsidies turn into increased taxation and fewer Christmases are observed during the good times).
With output and employment remaining flat, government subsidies and additional Christmases will merely produce more debt and higher prices.
Austrian School libertarians: Supporters of Friedrich von Hayek and Ludwig von Mises have two major objections to Christmas.
First, there is the illiberal aspect of the holiday season: the state has no right, and no reason, to force entrepreneurs to close down, against their will (for four days December 25 and 26, and January 1 and 2) over the course of a fortnight.
Second, the ever-lengthening pre-Christmas consumption boom tends to expand credit, thus causing bubbles in the toy and electronics market during the fall that will burst in January, with potentially damaging consequences for the rest of the year.
Empiricists: Convinced that observation is our only tool against economic ignorance, empiricists are certain that the only defensible theoretical propositions are those derived from discerning patterns whereby changes in exogenous variables constantly precede changes in endogenous variables, thus establishing empirically (for example, through Granger tests) the direction of causality.
This perspective leads empiricists to the safe conclusion that Christmas, and a spurt in gift exchanges, is caused by a prior increase in the money supply and, ceteris paribus, a drop in savings.
Marxists: In societies in which profit is derived exclusively from surplus value “donated” (as part of the capitalist labor process) by workers, and which reflects the capitalists’ extractive power (bequeathed to them by one-sided property rights over the means of production), the Christmas tradition of gift exchange packs dialectical significance.
On one hand, Christmas gift giving is an oasis of non-market exchange that points to the possibility of a non-capitalist system of distribution.
On the other hand, it offers capital another opportunity to harness humanity’s finest instincts to profit maximization, through the commodification of all that is pure and good about the festive season.
And purists – those who still defend the “law of the falling (long-term) rate of profit” – would say that capital’s capacity to profit from Christmas diminishes from year to year, thus giving rise to social and political forces which, in the long run, will undermine the festive season.
Obviously, none of these theories can possibly account for why people participate, year in and year out, in the ritual of holiday gift giving.
For that, we should be grateful.
A World Without Exhaust Pipes
SAN JOSÉ – The efficient movement of people is crucial for any society.
When transportation networks function well, they drive economic development and literally bring people together.
But in many parts of the world, mobility is a matter of life and death; it is dirty, unsafe, and chaotic.
Pollution and congestion from trucks, buses, and cars are daily hazards for millions, especially in emerging countries.
Fortunately, big changes are coming to how humans move.
For the first time since the mid-nineteenth century, when the modern internal combustion engine was invented, its demise is within sight.
Car manufacturers have announced plans for scores of electric models, and politicians in several European countries have put an expiry date on gasoline and diesel cars, with leaders in India and China aspiring to do the same.
Companies around the world are making bold predictions that electric mobility is the future of transportation.
Even those with the most to lose from a shift away from fossil fuels understand that electric vehicles (EV) are inevitable.
In July, even Ben van Beurden, the CEO of Shell, conceded that his next car will be electric.
More people are arriving at the same conclusion, and those of us who have been championing EVs as one of the solutions to climate change are optimistic that a tipping point is approaching.
Sales of electric cars have increased dramatically in recent years; some 750,000 were registered in 2016 – nearly half in China.
Still, it is human nature to resist change, and many prospective buyers remain hesitant.
That is why addressing consumption bias must be the highest priority over the next few years. Several changes are needed to ensure that growth in EV usage and sales continues.
For starters, consumers must overcome the belief that zero-emission mobility is only for wealthy people in developed countries.
Every year, 6.5 million people die from polluted air, and 92% of the world’s population lives in places where the air is unsafe to breathe.
Vehicle emissions are a major contributor to dirty air everywhere.
Investing in electric mobility and infrastructure – including electrified public transportation, charging stations, and electric car-sharing programs – will help, not hurt, development.
Support for such investments requires people to reject the false promise of “clean” fossil fuels.
Some industry officials insist that electric cars are not ready for mass rollout, and that a better solution would be to build more efficient gasoline and diesel engines.
This is the story we hear most often from car dealers in Latin America. But such views are as inaccurate as they are self-serving.
I have been fortunate to experience firsthand what electric mobility feels like, and how it is superior to gasoline- and diesel-only cars.
I’ve traveled for thousands of miles across several countries on all-electric road trips.
Once a driver experiences the clean, silent, and powerful technology, it is difficult to hand back the keys.
Governments and consumer groups everywhere must work together to put more people behind the wheel of these inspiring vehicles.
Finally, we must address the structural imbalances that persist in our transportation policies.
Simply put, those who suffer most from “dirty” mobility have the weakest political voice.
For example, data from the United Kingdom show that it is often the poorest people that walk or take buses.
Development of zero-emission public transit, therefore, is rarely a top priority for government leaders.
To sway them, advocates must sharpen their defenses of the economic and social benefits of zero-emission mobility, such as the positive effects on public health.
Changing course will take time.
In Costa Rica, my organization is working to encourage businesses and governments to sign an “electric mobility pact” to encourage investment in EV infrastructure.
In early 2018, we will open an online registry, and by the end of next year, we aim to have 100 public and private organizations on board.
Costa Rica’s legislature is also debating a bill to provide tax incentives for electric transportation.
Others in Latin America are finding their own ways to promote electric mobility.
In Chile, for example, the focus is on solar power and the link between mining and EV manufacturing.
But political changes alone will not push EVs into the fast lane.
To do that, customers will need to embrace a new clean-mobility narrative.
In Costa Rica, we pride ourselves on the fact that nearly all of our electricity is produced by renewable sources, including hydroelectric, geothermal, and wind.
This gives us an incentive to lead the global transition from gas-powered vehicles to electric cars, buses, and trains.
We Costa Ricans are striving toward “un país sin muflas” – a country without exhaust pipes.
Expanding that goal globally is the ultimate objective.
To be sure, pushing the electric engine past the gas-powered relic will remain an uphill battle.
But new technologies, like better batteries and speedier charging stations, will help accelerate the transition.
Just like the CEO of Shell, I, too, believe that the transition to electric mobility is inevitable.
What we see on the roads today is just the beginning.
Worker Protection in the Gig Economy
BERKELEY – Today’s labor markets are undergoing radical change, as digital platforms transform how they operate and revolutionize the nature of work.
In many ways, this is a positive development, one that has the potential to match workers with jobs more efficiently and transparently than ever before.
But the increasing digitization of the labor market also has at least one very worrying drawback: it is undermining the traditional employer-employee relationships that have been the primary channel through which worker benefits and protections have been provided.
The ecosystem of digital labor platforms is still in its infancy, but it is developing rapidly.
Large popular platforms like LinkedIn have so far mainly been used to match high-skill workers with high-end jobs.
But these platforms are already expanding to accommodate middle-skill workers and jobs.
Nearly 400 million people have posted their resumes on LinkedIn, and in 2014 the site facilitated more than one million new hires worldwide.
Meanwhile, other types of digital platforms are emerging, linking workers with customers or companies for specific tasks or services.
Such platforms play a growing role in the market for “contingent” or “on-demand” workers, broadly defined as workers whose jobs are temporary and who do not have standard part-time or full-time contracts with employers.
Well-known digital platforms that link contingent workers directly to customers include Lyft, TaskRabbit, Uber, and Angie’s List.
Freelancer.com and Upwork are examples of platforms that help companies find and hire contingent workers for a range of specialized tasks such as software or website development.
Freelancer.com has more than 17 million users worldwide.
The trouble is that even as these sites provide new opportunities for workers and companies, they are bypassing the traditional channels through which the US and many countries deliver benefits and protections to their workforce.
In the US, in particular, the “social contract” has long relied on employers to deliver unemployment insurance, disability insurance, pensions and retirement plans, worker’s compensation for job-related injuries, paid time off, and protections under the Fair Labor Standards Act.
Although the Affordable Care Act has made it easier for workers to acquire health insurance on their own, most workers continue to receive health insurance through their employers.
With the proliferation of digital job platforms, the social safety net for workers in the US – threadbare to begin with – is at risk of unraveling for a growing share of the workforce.
This is because most individuals who find work through digital job platforms operate as independent contractors, leaving them without the benefits and protections provided in standard employment contracts for full-time and part-time workers.
The difference between the cost of a full-time employee with benefits and an independent contractor can be 30% or more, so there is a strong incentive for companies to replace workers on standard full-time employment contracts with independent contractors as long as companies can attract the talent they need.
Digital job platforms also make it easier for businesses to hire and fire workers on temporary contingent contracts.
This creates the potential for a race to the bottom, with employers competing on labor costs through regulatory arbitrage.
Unless policymakers act, the US will continue to drift toward a two-tier labor market.
One tier will be populated by fully employed high-skill workers with generous employer-provided (and tax-advantaged) benefits, as well as high-skill individuals who finance their own benefits from high incomes earned as independent contractors or from self-employment. The other tier will include a large pool of contingent middle- and low-skill workers without the benefits, income, or security on which a robust and resilient middle class depends.
New policies are needed to provide workers in contingent employment relationships access to benefits, and new institutions are needed to deliver them.
There is growing support for the view that benefits should satisfy at least three conditions. They should be portable, attached to individual workers rather than to their employers.
They should be universal, applying to all workers and all forms of employment. And they should be pro-rated, linking employer benefit contributions to time worked, jobs completed, or income earned.
Two recent proposals incorporating these conditions call for the creation of “individual security accounts” analogous to US Social Security accounts, but encompassing portable benefits that would be available to all workers, regardless of employment status, and would accrue via pro-rated automatic payroll contributions.
A group of strange bedfellows – “gig” employers, labor organizations, venture capitalists, and bipartisan think tanks – recently issued a letter calling for a stable and flexible safety net based on these conditions.
Meanwhile, in Congress, forward-looking policymakers like Senator Mark Warner of Virginia are seeking ways to get ahead of the issues and create momentum for bipartisan solutions.
Much remains to be done before a new safety net for all workers is in place: determining which benefits and protections to include, how to pay for them, and how to deliver them to workers.
Labor groups, including unions or new types of labor organizations like Coworker.org and the Freelancers Union, could fill the gap, providing benefits as unions have done in the construction industry and guilds have done in the entertainment industry.
In Silicon Valley, where thousands of contractors and freelancers are hired every week, new private companies like MBO Partners are emerging to handle the benefits of contingent workers who work for many employers.
The McKinsey Global Institute estimates that digital labor platforms could increase US GDP by 2.3% and US full-time equivalent employment by 2.7% by 2025.
But realizing these economy-wide gains while providing a secure and portable safety net for all workers will require new ways of thinking by companies and policymakers.
Empowering Girls
WASHINGTON, DC – In the lottery of life, being born female in a poor country places one at a double disadvantage.
Women in poor countries have the highest global incidence of poverty of any demographic group, along with the worst health conditions, the least access to education, and the highest likelihood of being victims of violence.
Gender inequality – through workplace exclusion and lower pay – costs the world a staggering 15.5% of GDP.
Denying women opportunities to develop their potential means that societies forego their contribution.
Yet the frustrating reality is that effective solutions to address gender inequality can be difficult to identify.
At the most extreme end of the scale of disempowerment are the 30 million girls deemed at risk of female genital mutilation (FGM) over the next decade.
The procedure is almost universal in Somalia, Guinea, Djibouti, Egypt, Eritrea, Mali, Sierra Leone, and Sudan.
The World Health Organization warns that affected women suffer long-term health problems and higher rates of perinatal death.
But the problem is easier to identify than it is to solve.
Legal reforms have had little impact.
Even in the United Kingdom, where FGM was outlawed 30 years ago, not a single person has been successfully prosecuted.
The first-ever recorded figures, reported in July, showed that there were 5,702 new cases in England between April 2015 and March 2016.
At least 18 young women and girls were subjected to FGM in the UK, while most underwent the procedure in Africa.
There has been an overall decline in the prevalence of FGM over the last three decades.
But not all countries have made progress.
In fact, on current trends, the number of girls and women undergoing FGM will rise significantly over the next 15 years.
This is not to say that charities and governments working in this area are not doing some excellent work.
But we need more high-quality studies of how to identify and scale up effective programs.
Child marriage is another unacceptable custom that robs girls of opportunity.
From 2011 to 2020, more than 140 million girls worldwide will become child brides – defined by the United Nations as marriage before age 18.
In nine countries – Niger, Central African Republic, Chad, Bangladesh, Mali, Guinea, South Sudan, Burkina Faso, and Malawi – UNICEF estimates that child marriage rates are higher than 50%.
For young brides, the effects are far-reaching: lower education levels and lifetime earnings, higher rates of domestic violence, greater risk of dying during pregnancy or childbirth, and increased mortality rates for their children.
As with FGM, laws alone are not enough to address the problem.
Consider Bangladesh, where 52% of girls are married by the time they reach the legal age of 18.
Numerous laws prohibiting child marriage and dowries have had scant effect, with 18% of girls – the world’s highest rate – married before they turn 15.
Programs by community groups to give adolescent girls life skills and training have had limited impact.
Analysis in Bangladesh by economists from Duke University and MIT’s Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab suggests that providing financial incentives to delay marriage could be the most effective strategy.
Girls in the poorest 20% of the global population are more than twice as likely as those in the wealthiest 20% to be married young.
A promising program in southern Bangladesh gave cooking oil to parents of unmarried girls.
Every four months, participants received four liters of oil, conditional upon a monitor confirming that the girls were still unmarried.
This modest incentive worked: daughters of recipients were up to 30% less likely to marry before 16, yielding benefits four times higher than the costs.
Promisingly, the program also improved girls’ education levels: daughters of recipients were up to 22% more likely to remain in school.
This matters, because one of the key targets of the Millennium Development Goals, which concluded in 2015, was to eliminate gender disparity in primary and secondary education.
Good progress was made in the primary sector, but access to secondary and university-level education still remains highly unequal.
Differences in enrollment in primary education have decreased in all regions, but Sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East, and North Africa lag behind.
Reducing the gender gap in schooling would have benefits that reach the next generation as well.
More education for girls means better health and nutrition outcomes for their children.
How we achieve this will vary.
Providing free school uniforms, for example, helps in some places, but not everywhere.
In Bangladesh, the intervention for child marriage reduction had auxiliary benefits in furthering secondary education.
New research shows that, globally, money spent to reduce gender disparity in education yields benefits around five times higher than the costs.
Many well-meaning and even unquestionably good ideas to reduce gender inequality are harder to analyze and quantify.
Ensuring that women have equal rights to inherit property, sign a contract, register a business, or open a bank account would all cost little and could have far-reaching benefits.
Despite data problems, a panel of Nobel laureates convened by Copenhagen Consensus identified such measures as one of the 19 best development targets to pursue, with every dollar spent producing benefits worth more than $15.
We do know how to tackle one problem – and we have ample data on costs and benefits.
Some 225 million women who want to avoid pregnancy are not using safe and effective family-planning methods.
The reasons range from a lack of access to information or services to lack of support from their partners or communities.
Ensuring universal access to contraception would cost $3.6 billion annually, but would mean 150,000 fewer maternal deaths and 600,000 fewer orphans.
Moreover, the demographic dividend from fewer dependents and more people in the workforce would accelerate economic growth.
The total benefits are an astounding 120 times higher than the costs.
There are no quick fixes for gender inequality, but one thing is clear: not all efforts are equally good or supported by sound data.
On moral and economic grounds, policymakers should adopt those measures that do the most to empower girls and women.
The End of AIDS
NEW YORK – The AIDS pandemic claimed around 36 million lives between 1981 and 2016, and a similar number around the world currently live with the HIV virus.
Some 1.2 million people died of AIDS last year, and another 1.8 million were infected.
Those statistics are daunting, but the startling news is that the goal of an “AIDS-Free Generation” is realistically within reach.
The required policy steps should be agreed in the early days of US President-elect Donald Trump’s administration.
The key reason that the epidemic can be ended is a scientific finding back in 2011 that showed that HIV-positive individuals receiving antiretroviral (ARV) treatment suppress the HIV virus in their bloodstreams so dramatically that they are very unlikely to transmit the virus to others through sex or shared needles.
This finding confirmed the concept of “treatment as prevention.”
If a high enough proportion of HIV-positive individuals receive ARV treatment, it is possible not only to save their lives, but also to break the transmission of the virus itself, thereby ending the epidemic.
Building on this idea, AIDS specialists developed two crucial ideas: “90-90-90” and the “cascade of AIDS care.”
The 90-90-90 program aims to ensure that by the year 2020, 90% of all HIV-infected individuals know that they are infected (the first 90); 90% of all those who know they are infected are receiving ARV treatment (the second 90); and 90% of all those receiving ARV treatment successfully suppress the HIV virus in the blood.
The idea of the cascade is that if each of the three “90s” is achieved, the proportion of all HIV-infected individuals with viral suppression would be 90% x 90% x 90%, which is equal to 72%.
If 72% of those infected today can no longer infect others, the HIV/AIDS epidemic will be curtailed.
Indeed, if 90-90-90 in 2020 becomes 95-95-95 by the year 2030, the proportion of HIV-positive individuals that cannot infect others would rise to 86%.
The ongoing epidemic would grind to a halt, just as a measles epidemic among children in a metropolitan area ends when 80% percent of the children are vaccinated, even if the other 20% percent of children remain unvaccinated.
Some cases would remain, but the AIDS catastrophe would be over.
The goal of reaching 90-90-90 by the year 2020 and 95-95-95 by 2030 is realistic, if countries strive for success.
Sweden recently announced that it has reached the 90-90-90 targets.
Many other high-income countries are close.
With international help and national efforts, 90-90-90 could be achieved not only in high-income countries but in developing countries as well.
For most of the world, the biggest challenge is ensuring that by 2020 at least 90% of HIV-positive individuals are tested and learn that they are infected – the first of the three 90s.
To reach this goal, people who are symptomatic or at high risk need to be connected to the health system for testing.
Once an HIV-infected individual tests positive, achieving the second 90% (AVR treatment) depends mainly on funding and staffing; with a sufficient health budget, medicines can be made available for all infected individuals.
Achieving the third 90% (suppression of the viral load) depends mainly on whether AVR-treated individuals take the medications on schedule.
That may require social support to encourage the patients to continue the medications even when they feel healthy, and to help ensure the timely and affordable supply of medications.
The 90-90-90 targets can be reached even among impoverished and hard-to-reach populations, thanks to a new and powerful public-health solution: community health workers (CHWs) supported by smartphones.
CHWs are local community residents with at least a high-school education, who are trained for a few months in the management of specific health challenges, such as identifying potentially HIV-infected individuals, bringing them to the clinic for testing, and helping them to adhere to their medical protocols.
New smartphone apps help them to do their job.
In rural Africa, where doctors are typically very scarce and AIDS prevalence is often high, the high life-saving potential of CHWs has been very well demonstrated and documented.
Moreover, being a CHW offers a good way for young people to start their careers.
Though initial compensation is very modest (perhaps $100 per month), the experience and training can put these young workers on a path toward further education (such as nursing), rising skills, and higher incomes.
Yet, despite the potential to bring the AIDS epidemic to an end, the world is currently stuck in limbo.
Sadly, our governments operate not on the basis of bold goals and the means to achieve them, but on “business as usual.”
Sixteen years ago, business as usual meant almost no treatment of poor people with AIDS, because financing was not available.
At that time, I recommended a new “Global Fund” to finance AIDS treatment, an idea that was adopted and then helped to start an era of AIDS control in Africa.
US President George W. Bush’s administration made a major US financial commitment to AIDS, and the Global Fund and US programs together helped millions of people gain access to treatment.
Yet, after the 2008 financial crisis erupted, President Barack Obama leveled off the US financing, and the global AIDS control effort got caught in a “half-way” mode.
As of 2016, roughly half of all HIV-positive individuals are on ARV treatment, far short of the 90% target.
The incoming Trump administration should grasp the historic opportunity to help bring AIDS to an end through a modest financial commitment by governments and other funders.
An extra $10 billion per year from all sources would likely be sufficient to get the job done, with just $3-4 billion annually from the US.
Skeptics will scoff that Trump is an unlikely champion of such an effort; but, frankly, who would have guessed 15 years ago that Bush would be the key mover of the financial scale-up of the fight against AIDS?
History is full of positive as well as negative surprises; the end of AIDS can be a historic achievement of our generation, if we reach for it.
Building Up the BRICS
MANCHESTER – This year’s meeting of the BRICS in India is taking place just a fortnight after the 15th anniversary of the creation of the term “BRICs,” which I coined to refer to the major emerging economies: Brazil, Russia, India, and China (South Africa was added in 2010).
Recently, my brief tenure in the British government came to an end, following the completion of an independent review on antimicrobial resistance (AMR) that I had been chairing.
As I ponder what to do next, and as the BRICS leaders meet, I can’t help but wonder about the term’s meaning today.
Have these large and promising emerging economies fulfilled expectations?
Perhaps the simplest way to answer this question relates to my work on the AMR review, which was launched by former British Prime Minister David Cameron in 2014.
On September 21, we achieved a major victory: a high-level agreement by the United Nations on the topic.
After the agreement was reached, a German television crew that had occasionally followed my team and me as we worked to spread awareness of AMR asked me, on air, whether the outcome was more important than the BRIC concept.
Without even waiting for me to answer, they declared that it obviously was.
And they were right: no economy, emerging or otherwise, can hope to be successful if it is plagued by a health threat as serious and uncontrollable as AMR.
But there is more to the story: the BRICS are just as important to tackling AMR as tackling AMR is to the BRICS.
South Africa, for one, was a key supporter of the United Kingdom in discussions about AMR at the recent G20 summit in Hangzhou, China, and the issue might not have ended up in the meeting’s communiqué without its support.
And that is the point.
The BRICS today, like in 2001, have a vital role to play in tackling the most pressing international challenges.
In fact, I came up with the acronym not just because the letters fit together, but also because of the word’s actual meaning: these emerging economies, I argued in my 2001 paper, should be the building blocks of freshly overhauled global financial and governance systems.
Yet, as we approach this year’s autumn meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, the BRICS remain severely underrepresented by these critical institutions.
If this does not change, with reforms going much further than they have so far, we will soon find that “global governance” is no longer global at all.
To be sure, the BRICS have lately been going through a rough time.
The economic performance of Brazil and Russia, in particular, has been very disappointing so far this decade, to the point that many now perceive those countries as unworthy of the status the acronym afforded them.
But the suggestion that the BRICS’ importance was overstated is simply naïve.
The size of the original four BRICs economies, taken together, is roughly consistent with the projections I made all those years ago.
Both Russia and Brazil now account for a similar share of global GDP as they did in 2001, though Russia, according to my simple calculation, might currently be outside the world’s ten largest economies.
Brazil, for all of its considerable problems, is higher in the world ranking today than even I had envisaged back then.
India continues along roughly the same path it was on 15 years ago.
With the right structural reforms, it may even be able to achieve a sustained period of Chinese-style double-digit economic growth.
But the biggest BRICS success story remains China, which, despite its recent slowdown, has far exceeded expectations.
If the economy grows at an annual rate of around 6% for the remainder of the decade, it will fulfill my 20-year projection.
This is not to diminish the challenges confronting China.
But if it manages to address the most urgent among them – downside deflationary risks – its much-discussed debt challenge will become far more manageable.
Fortunately for China, other countries want – or should want – it to succeed.
After all, a dynamic Chinese economy is in the interest of many other countries, especially those that can export the goods and services that a more modern, consumer-driven China needs.
In fact, the rise of the Chinese consumer may well be the most important single global economic variable today – even more important than, say, the economic problems afflicting Europe and Japan or questions about India’s enduring global relevance.
The potential barriers to the BRICS’ growth and development are many, including health threats like AMR, educational challenges, inadequate representation in global governance bodies, and a number of short-term cyclical problems.
Policymakers worldwide must commit themselves to dismantling these barriers, and enabling the BRICS to fulfill, finally, their true potential.
The Geopolitics of Environmental Challenges
LONDON – Much of the world seems to be on edge.
The West’s relationship with Russia, the future of NATO, the Syrian civil war and refugees, rising right-wing populism, the impact of automation, and the United Kingdom’s impending departure from the European Union: all of these topics – and more – have roiled public debate worldwide.
But one issue – one might say the most significant of them all – is being ignored or pushed aside: the environment.
That was the case at this year’s annual meeting of the World Economic Forum at Davos, Switzerland.
Beyond a mention of the Paris climate agreement by Chinese President Xi Jinping, topics like climate change and sustainable development didn’t even make it to the main stage.
Instead, they were relegated to side meetings that rarely seemed to intersect with current political and economic events.
Allowing environmental issues to fall by the wayside at this time of geopolitical and social instability is a mistake, and not just because this happens to be a critical moment in the fight to manage climate change.
Environmental degradation and natural-resource insecurity are undermining our ability to tackle some of the biggest global issues we face.
Environmental insecurity is a major, though often underestimated, contributor to global instability.
The UN High Commission on Refugees reports that natural disasters have displaced more than 26 million people per year since 2008 – almost a third of the total number of forcibly displaced people in this time period.
Even the current refugee crisis has an environmental element.
In the years leading up to the war, Syria experienced its most extreme drought in recorded history.
That drought, together with unsustainable agricultural practices and poor resource management, contributed to the internal displacement of 1.5 million Syrians and catalyzed political unrest ahead of the 2011 uprising.
The link between environmental and agricultural pressures extends far beyond Syria.
Over-reliance on specific geographies for agriculture means that food production can exacerbate environmental problems, or even create new ones.
This can pit global consumer interests against local citizen interests, as it has along the Mississippi River, where fertilizer runoff from one of the world’s breadbaskets is contributing to concerns about water quality.
The connection goes both ways, with environmental conditions also shaping agricultural production – and, in turn, the prices of agricultural commodities, which represent about 10% of traded goods worldwide.
For example, rising temperatures and altered precipitation patterns are already driving up the price of coffee.
With the global land area suitable for growing coffee set to contract by up to half by 2050, price pressures will only intensify.
A sudden shift toward trade protectionism could drive up agricultural commodity prices further.
Such an increase would affect farm-level household income, favoring some farmers while harming others.
End consumers, particularly the poor and vulnerable, would also suffer.
Another reason why the environment should be at the center of economic debates is its role as the world’s single largest employer.
Almost a billion people, just under 20% of the world’s labor force, are formally employed in agriculture.
Another billion or so are engaged in subsistence farming, and therefore don’t register in formal wage statistics.
Any initiatives to support economic development must support this population’s transition toward higher-productivity activities.
This is particularly important at a time when increasingly sophisticated and integrated technology threatens to leapfrog an entire generation of workers in some countries.
Efforts to benefit this huge population must focus not only on training and education, but also on new models that allow countries to capitalize on their natural capital – the landscapes, watersheds, and seascapes – without depleting it.
Just as natural-resource insecurity can cause displacement and vulnerability, effective natural-resource management can support conflict resolution and sustainable economic development.
On this front, efforts to achieve environmental remediation, to boost the resilience of rural communities, to advance sustainable agricultural production, and to support community-based environmental stewardship have all shown promising results.
Consider the Northern Rangelands Trust, an organization focused on creating community conservancies to enable sustainable and equitable land use in Kenya.
NRT has helped pastoralist communities establish effective governance mechanisms for the environment on which they depend, reducing conflict over grazing rights, especially in times of drought.
For many communities, members’ relationship with the landscape in which they live is an integral part of their identity.
With effective governance and planning, open dialogue, resource-sharing frameworks, and sufficient investment, including in skills training, these communities can translate this relationship into effective environmental stewardship – and build healthier and more secure societies.
The crises engulfing the modern world are complex.
But one thing is clear: the environment is connected to all of them.
Solutions will mean little without a healthy world in which to implement them.
The Strange Death of Turkish Secularism
JERUSALEM – The aftermath of Turkey’s failed military coup raises a fundamental question: will President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan continue to pursue his authoritarian path, perhaps with a vengeance, or will he reach out to his opponents and attempt to bridge the deep fissures in Turkish society?
The jury is still out, but judging from previous historical examples, serious challenges to authoritarian or semi-authoritarian leaders usually lead to a hardening of the regime, not greater moderation.
And Erdoğan’s moves since the coup’s collapse – mass arrests and purges of thousands of soldiers, judges, police, and teachers were announced almost immediately – seem to confirm the more pessimistic scenario.
Yet it would be a mistake to view what is now happening in Turkey exclusively through the prism of Erdoğan’s personality and his authoritarian inclinations.
He and his Justice and Development Party (AKP) represent a tectonic shift in Turkish politics, one with parallels in other Muslim-majority countries in the Middle East.
In trying to move the path of Turkish history away from the radical secularism of modern Turkey’s founder, Kemal Atatürk, the AKP initially appeared to veer from the Kemalist authoritarian mold.
Because Western observers were supportive of the secular nature of Kemalism, many overlooked that the regime was more similar to 1930s European fascism – a nationalistic one-party state with Atatürk himself at the apex of a personality cult – than to liberal democracy.
Only in the 1950s was the system slowly loosened.
Kemalist secularism was not the expression of a wide, popular movement from below; it was imposed by a small urban elite – military and intellectual – on a traditional and mostly rural society.
Kemalism not only introduced a variant of the Latin alphabet, which totally cut off Turks from any link to their history and culture; it also banned traditional forms of attire (fez, baggy trousers for men, headscarves for women) and forced a European dress code on the entire population.
All Arabic- or Muslim-sounding surnames had to be changed to Turkic ones.
No European society has experienced so wrenching a process of top-down cultural revolution.
In the West, secularization went hand in hand with the Enlightenment project of democratization and liberalization.
In Turkey – and in a less radical form under the Shah in Iran and under military dictators in countries like Egypt, Tunisia, Syria, and Iraq – the population never had a choice.
The AKP’s electoral victories since 2002 (as well as comparable developments in other Muslim countries) were, in a way, the return of the repressed.
Because the Kemalist system eventually liberalized politically (though not culturally), the emergence of a multiparty system eventually also empowered the traditional conservatives whose preferences had long been denied.
At the same time, economic modernization brought social mobility to the conservatives, which led to the emergence of a new bourgeoisie that clung to its traditional religious values and viewed the Kemalist elite – ensconced in the army, the bureaucracy, the judiciary, and the universities – as oppressors.
These voters formed the basis of the AKP’s electoral victories and democratic legitimacy.
The recent effort by elements of the army – the shield of Kemalist secularism – to overturn the will of the people (as it has done three times in the last half-century) confirms the continuing clash between secularism and democracy in Turkey.
At the same time, Erdoğan’s foreign policy in recent years has been anything but successful.
His initial commitment to “zero conflicts with neighbors” has led, instead, to deteriorating relations with Armenia, Russia, Israel, and Egypt – not to mention significant domestic blowback, including a wave of terrorist attacks, from involvement in Syria’s civil war.
None of this has eroded Erdoğan’s support at home, while the United States and the European Union found themselves supporting him, albeit through clenched teeth, against the latest coup attempt.
This attests to Western powers’ fundamental interest in a stable Turkey, which the EU needs in order to stop further waves of immigrants, mainly from Syria, and which the US needs for its war, limited as it is, against the Islamic State.
It is doubtful that Erdoğan’s pursuit of internal enemies – real and imagined – will prevent either the US or the EU from courting Turkish cooperation.
But Erdoğan’s brutal response to the coup attempt – which may include show trials, in addition to the “cleansing” of public institutions of both remnants of the secularist establishment and his former allies in the Gülen movement – will only deepen the chasms within Turkish society.
Indeed, terrorist attacks have been launched not only by the Islamic State, but also by Kurdish militants, whose demands for autonomy challenge the concept of an indivisible Turkish nation – a cornerstone of the Kemalist state.
Prior to the attempted putsch, Erdoğan made significant moves to reduce tension with Russia and Israel, and both efforts seem unlikely to be derailed by his post-coup crackdown.
Yet Syria’s civil war does not appear to be winding down, and the de facto implosion of Syria as a coherent state will continue to challenge Turkish politics and social cohesion, with more and more refugees trying to cross into Turkey.
Ultimately, Kemalist military-based secularism proved to be unsustainable: its demolition under the AKP enjoys broad support.
But the failed coup is likely to reinforce the illiberal aspects of the democracy emerging under Erdoğan, in which the will of the people and majoritarian rule runs counter to pluralism, human rights, and freedom of speech.
The stability of such a system in Turkey – where, despite popular opposition to the coup, hostility to Erdoğan is strong – remains to be seen.
The Euro’s Narrow Path
BERKELEY – With Emmanuel Macron’s victory in the French presidential election, and Angela Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union enjoying a comfortable lead in opinion polls ahead of Germany’s general election on September 24, a window has opened for eurozone reform.
The euro has always been a Franco-German project.
With a dynamic new leader in one country and a fresh popular mandate in the other, there is now an opportunity for France and Germany to correct their creation’s worst flaws.
But the two sides remain deeply divided.
Macron, in long-standing French tradition, insists that the monetary union suffers from too little centralization.
The eurozone, he argues, needs its own finance minister and its own parliament. It needs a budget in the hundreds of billions of euros to underwrite investment projects and augment spending in countries with high unemployment.
Merkel, on the other hand, views the monetary union’s problem as one of too much centralization and too little national responsibility.
She worries that a large eurozone budget wouldn’t be spent responsibly.
While not opposed to a eurozone finance minister, she does not envision that official possessing expansive powers.
But there is a narrow path forward that should be acceptable to both sides.
It starts with completing the banking union.
Europe now has a single supervisor in the European Central Bank, but it lacks a common deposit insurance scheme, which German officials oppose on the grounds that there has been inadequate risk reduction in the European banking system.
In other words, they worry that the fees levied on German banks will be used to pay off depositors in other countries.
The solution lies in bulletproofing the banks by strictly applying the demanding capital standards of Basel III and limiting concentrated holdings of government bonds.
The paradox here is that European regulators, including German regulators, have in fact been arguing for looser application of those regulations in negotiations with the United States.
In doing so, they have been arguing against their own best interests.
Next, Europe needs to transform the European Stability Mechanism, its proto-rescue fund, into a true European Monetary Fund (EMF).
Its resources could be augmented by increasing governments’ capital subscriptions and expanding its ability to borrow.
Decision-making could be streamlined by moving from the current unanimity rule to qualified majority voting.
The EMF could then take the place of the ECB and the European Commission in negotiating the terms of financing programs with governments.
The final decision of whether to extend an emergency loan would no longer fall to heads of state in all-night talks.
Rather, it would be taken by a board made up of eurozone representatives, including from civil society, nominated by the European Council and confirmed by the European Parliament, giving the process a legitimacy it currently lacks.
But Germany will agree only if it sees steps limiting the likelihood of expensive intervention.
This brings us to the vexed question of fiscal policy.
It is past time to abandon the fiction that the ultimate source of fiscal discipline is a set of strictly enforced EU rules.
Taxation and public spending remain sensitive national prerogatives, rendering outside oversight ineffectual.
Assigning oversight to the European Commission in Brussels promises, inevitably, not discipline but a dangerous populist backlash.
The alternative is to return control of fiscal policy to national governments, abandoning the pretense that policy can be regimented by EU rules.
Governments could then make their own decisions; if they make bad decisions, they will have to restructure their debts.
Adopting a European debt-restructuring mechanism would help to avoid the worst fallout.
Any adverse consequences would no longer spread to other countries, because their banks would no longer hold concentrations of government bonds.
They would not bankrupt the EMF, which would be able to lend only in cases of illiquidity, not insolvency.
These ideas will horrify dedicated euro-federalists.
One bone they can be thrown is a pilot unemployment insurance fund amounting to, say, 1% of eurozone GDP.
This would be analogous to US arrangements under which the federal government provides partial funding for state-administered unemployment insurance.
And it would give the eurozone finance minister something to do. If the initial modest program was shown to work, it could be scaled up.
But German politicians are aware that unemployment is 2.5 times higher in France than at home, raising the danger that transfers would all go one way.
That’s why such proposals are contingent on structural reforms that reduce unemployment where it is high and increase the flexibility of labor and product markets.
This is essentially the bargain Macron has offered Merkel.
To paraphrase, “I’ll undertake deep structural reforms if you agree to modest steps in the direction of fiscal federalism, completing the banking union, and creating a European Monetary Fund.”
No one on either side of the Rhine will regard this bargain as perfect.
But with the euro in the balance, the perfect should not be allowed to become the enemy of the good.
Three Ways Ahead for the Eurozone
WASHINGTON, DC – After a tumultuous year, politics seem to be stabilizing across Europe.
Though the far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) gained almost 13% of the vote in Germany’s recent federal election, it does not pose a serious threat to Chancellor Angela Merkel’s leadership.
In France – the other pillar of the European project – President Emmanuel Macron can count on a solid parliamentary majority.
And, despite the uncertainty surrounding the details of Brexit, there is little doubt that, whatever plans the European Union makes, it will be doing so without the United Kingdom as a member.
So now the question is how the EU and, in particular, the eurozone, will move forward.
There are three possibilities.
The first option is a “more united union,” as described by European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker in his state of the union address last month.
Juncker’s vision rejects a multi-speed Europe, in favor of uniform steps by all EU members.
This would mean, for starters, expanding the Schengen Area of border-free travel to include Bulgaria and Romania.
Juncker also called for progress toward a European Social Standards Union embodying a shared understanding of welfare entitlement in the single market.
As for the euro, Juncker stressed that it is meant to be the currency of the entire EU, not just select countries.
With that in mind, the EU should pursue the creation of a full banking union, in which banking rules and supervision are consistent across all member states.
The commissioner for economic and financial affairs should become a European finance minister, and the European Stabilization Mechanism should become the European Monetary Fund.
A year ago, such “hardline” integrationism would have lacked credibility; after all, the UK would never stand for it.
But, with Brexit apparently a sure thing, Juncker’s vision has gained some credibility.
Nonetheless, Juncker’s “one-speed” approach to integration remains highly controversial.
So Macron has set out his own ambitious vision for Europe, which echoes many of Juncker’s proposals, but seems to allow for more differentiation within the EU, at least in the medium term.
For example, if Poland does not want to adopt the euro, it should not be forced to do so, and that decision should not prevent other eurozone countries from moving ahead with integration.
That is why Macron wants a separate eurozone parliament, which would decide on matters that do not pertain to all members of the European Parliament.
Differences in the level of integration countries pursued today would not prevent anyone – or everyone – from eventually joining the EU’s deeply integrated “core.”
The third – and, it seems, most likely – way forward for the eurozone is business as usual.
The economic crisis that long powered calls for more integration – and, in some cases, for more fragmentation – has subsided, with eurozone GDP growth now exceeding 2% and unemployment having declined significantly.
Even Greece – the one country that remains, to some extent, in crisis mode – continues to muddle through.
In this context, policymakers may well decide, as they have so many times before, to put ambitious eurozone reforms on the back burner, deciding that the reforms pursued during the crisis are sufficient.
This would leave them more space to focus on other areas – such as energy, digital regulation, and migration – that in the current context may appear to require more urgent attention.
If policymakers do go this route, there are serious risks.
Yes, the eurozone is now functioning, and key reforms in other areas are important.
But the monetary union retains a fundamental flaw: the absence of mechanisms capable of forestalling cost divergences across countries that have lost the ability to engage in exchange-rate adjustment.
One such mechanism would be more labor mobility in services.
But even if eurozone countries agreed to further labor-market liberalization, workers would face high cultural and linguistic barriers.
In any case, without any such mechanism, the trends that culminated in the last economic crisis could well lead to another.
After the experience of the crisis, if signs of growing cost divergences begin to emerge in the future, interest-rate differentials among eurozone countries will rise much faster than they did before the last crisis, providing an earlier warning signal.
Yet, given that much of the debt overhang remains and much of the rescue ammunition has been spent, another shock could be devastating.
As Martin Wolf reports, the economist Adam Lerrick proposes a scheme whereby the beneficiaries of sudden changes in interest-rate differentials would transfer half their gains into a “financing cost stabilization account,” to be paid back when the interest-rate shock subsides.
But, like other eurozone reforms, such a scheme would have to be agreed among eurozone members.
With Merkel still forming her new coalition government, it is impossible to say for certain what approach to integration Europe will take in the coming years.
But, given the likelihood that her coalition will include the Euroskeptic Free Democrats and the pro-integration Greens, with her own Christian Democrats in between, rapid pursuit of ambitious integration objectives for the entire EU seems unlikely.
A more realistic option is a multi-speed effort whereby the eurozone countries can move ahead, while others are allowed to wait.
The outcome would not be perfect, but it would be better – much better – than the status quo.
Redefining Europe, and Europeans
LEIPZIG – Traveling through Germany in the run-up to its federal election on September 24, one cannot help but be struck by the lingering signs of profound trauma from the 2015 refugee crisis.
Suddenly and virtually without warning, nearly a million desperate people – mostly Syrians fleeing the carnage in their homeland – flocked to Germany.
And while Germany may be Europe’s most bureaucratically well-managed country, even it was overwhelmed.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s response to the crisis two years ago was to throw out the rulebook and open her country’s borders.
She famously told the German people, “Wir schaffen das” (We can do it).
But German public opinion today suggests that the country has become warier of such bold gestures.
Yes, Germany did it, because there was no alternative; and many Germans are proud of their country for rising to the occasion.
But most hope that such a crisis never happens again.
Although many Germans have come to terms with what happened two years ago, a small minority still feels betrayed.
They have responded with anger and xenophobic nationalism, and these sentiments will undoubtedly be reflected in how they vote.
But Germany’s trauma from the refugee crisis should be put in perspective.
Far more refugees have sought and found protection in countries such as Lebanon and Turkey than in Germany.
In relative terms, Germany would have had to take in 20 million refugees to match Lebanon in 2015.
In Turkey, Istanbul alone is now hosting more refugees than all of Germany.
Of course, Germany is not the only European country that remains unsettled from the refugee crisis.
In my own country, Sweden, a political party that wants to shut us off from the rest of the world will most likely make strong gains in next year’s general election.
And in many Central European countries that only recently regained their sense of sovereignty, refugees are widely viewed as posing a threat to national identity.
One way or another, these issues will dominate European politics in the years ahead.
Europe is slowly trying to build up resilience to the kind of trauma it experienced in 2015.
It is a continent that once exported war and turmoil, but that now wants to protect itself from its neighbors’ problems.
One of the lessons from 2015 is that the European Union will need to develop a far stronger common foreign and security policy.
The EU must replace lofty rhetoric with concrete action, while also accepting its regional and global responsibilities.
Barbed wire fencing between Hungary and Serbia will not shield Europe from the effects of war in Ukraine, putsches and terrorism in Anatolia, or violent conflagrations in the Levant and Mesopotamia.
And it will not help Europe manage the dramatic shift now underway in Africa, which will be home to 40% of the world’s working-age population in a few decades.
Another lesson from 2015 is that European countries must learn to redefine their national identities.
The United States, Australia, and Canada have all been built on immigration, and most of us are the progeny of people from somewhere else.
Indeed, there is not much left of the “first nations” in these countries.
It is now entirely possible for there to be more people of Swedish descent in Chicago than in Stockholm.
To be sure, Europe is different from its Western counterparts.
Its tribes have been fighting one another for millennia.
And for the past two centuries, Europeans have been building ever-stronger nation-states and national identities on the basis of long, complicated historical experiences.
The EU itself was of course built by nation-states.
But their citizens wanted to overcome their long legacy of tribalism and war.
Judged by that objective, the EU’s first half-century has been a tremendous success.
And yet the strains are there for anyone to see.
Whether justified or not, when people perceive a threat to their national identity, their tribal instincts kick in.
And for a truly frightened few, Brussels and Mecca have both come to be seen as mortal threats.
For Europe to find its place in a rapidly changing world, its citizens will have to learn to tap multiple identities.
One can be a proud Swede and a proud European at the same time; one can also be both German and Turkish, and derive strength from that duality.
It is not disloyal to see oneself as a citizen of the world.
On the contrary, it is honorable.
Such a shift in attitudes would make for a very different Europe.
We would have finally moved on from ancient tribal conflicts and fears, and embraced a networked, digital future.
Merkel, who will likely be elected to another four-year term as chancellor on September 24, told Germans that they “can do it.”
But whether Germany and the rest of Europe will do it remains to be seen.
We have our work cut out for us.
The Federalist Threat to Europe
STOCKHOLM – The world is fundamentally different after the “Brexit” referendum in the United Kingdom.
It will be decades before we know the full effect of British voters’ decision to leave the European Union.
One thing we can know for sure, however, is that it is in the EU’s best interest to maintain strong ties with the UK, despite the fact that British voters made their decision unilaterally.
Too much is at stake to allow the process to be dominated by petty power games that overshadow or undermine common interests, as happens so often in European politics.
Economically, growth in the EU will undoubtedly benefit from an open trading relationship with Britain.
A free-trade agreement that includes financial services will minimize the damage from Brexit for all parties involved, because European firms will still rely on London as the region’s only global financial center.
Even if banking services migrate elsewhere in the eurozone, companies like Volvo, Siemens, and Total will still need London if they are to compete with companies like Toyota, GE, and Exxon.
Politically, the EU and the UK will benefit from maintaining close cooperation because neither side is spared from the problems afflicting the region today.
These include increasing aggression from Russia and its president, Vladimir Putin; the rise of ISIS and the threat of homegrown terrorism; and refugees fleeing to Europe from the Middle East and North Africa.
Moreover, the Brexit vote does not change the strategic importance of NATO, where continued cooperation is necessary and where the EU needs the UK as much as the UK needs the EU.
So, what should the EU do?
European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker has called for more federalism – for more power to be delegated to the EU’s governing institutions.
I consider Juncker a close friend, but I strongly disagree with him about this idea.
Moving toward deeper integration or centralized control would be a dangerous path to take, for it would increase the risk of other members choosing to leave the EU.
And, beyond that hazard, there are other reasons to avoid federalist measures.
Consider the main economic argument offered by federalists: the eurozone needs a common fiscal policy to harmonize policy decisions, such as taxation.
This is wrong for two reasons.
First, the EU’s fundamental economic problems are structural.
Europeans will continue to gravitate toward populism if they do not see improvements in their standard of living, which will happen only with higher productivity growth.
A single fiscal policy would not bring this about – and could make the problem worse.
What Europe needs, instead, is a reform strategy that increases competitiveness and reduces barriers to competition.
In particular, EU policymakers should pursue policies that make labor markets more flexible.
These would include lower marginal tax rates, tighter criteria for determining benefits eligibility, stricter requirements for job searches, more resources for skills training, and less restrictive employment-protection regulation.
The second reason is political.
Put plainly, there is no political support for the higher taxes and spending cuts that would be necessary with a common fiscal policy.
Brussels would be accused of wasting taxpayers’ money, and any effort to disregard public opinion and impose fiscal integration on EU members would only backfire and fuel the wave of populist rage that carried the Brexiteers to victory.
Today, supporters of the EU must face the facts: an ever-closer union is not the European people’s will, even in the member states that would never choose to leave it.
If the European Commission forces the post-Brexit narrative in this direction, the result will be the opposite of what was intended.
In fact, federalism is probably the single greatest threat to the future of the EU.
Those who want the EU to survive should resist the temptation to assert more control.
We need a Europe that stands united because it wants to, not because it is forced to by new political super-structures that lack any underpinning of popular support.
Europe’s Battle on Four Fronts
LONDON – With Germany’s election over, Europe has reached the end of a season of continuous political upsets.
It is now time for actions that adequately respond to the upheavals created by all these votes.
Frans Timmermans, the European Commission’s first vice president, last year described the state of Europe as “multi-crisis”: Brexit, refugees, “illiberal democracy” in Hungary and Poland, the still-unresolved euro crisis, and the geopolitical risks attributable to Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin.
All are challenging the “European project” that began 60 years ago with the Treaty of Rome.
But crises invariably create opportunities.
And last year’s multi-crisis has produced a convergence of opportunities.
European leaders no longer have an excuse for inaction while they wait for voters’ next rebuff.
Economic reforms in France, German unease about refugees and the euro, new attitudes toward European integration in Brussels, and signs that Brexit will be delayed indefinitely or even completely averted: all have created new possibilities for taming the dangerous forces unleashed by last year’s populist revolts.
But realizing these opportunities will require four simultaneous political and economic breakthroughs across Europe.
France must act on over-regulation and excessive public spending.
Germany must rethink fiscal austerity and monetary dogma.
Britain needs a turnabout on nationalism and immigration.
And European Union officials must abandon their obsession with driving all member countries toward an “ever-closer union” that many of their citizens do not want.
Without simultaneous breakthroughs on all four fronts, it is hard to imagine progress on any of the separate aspects of the multi-crisis.
For example, any easing of German-inspired austerity will require evidence of economic reform in France; but French reforms will succeed only if Germany agrees to more generous fiscal rules and supports monetary policies that benefit the eurozone’s weaker members.
Similarly, Brexit could be averted or indefinitely delayed if the EU offered an extension of the negotiating period beyond March 2019 and suggested some modest concessions on immigration and welfare payments.
But European leaders would consider offering such concessions only if they saw clear evidence that British voters were changing their minds about leaving the EU.
Now consider the German voters who have turned against Chancellor Angela Merkel and her SPD coalition partners, mainly because they resent what they see as uncontrolled immigration and unjustified transfer payments to Greece.
These voters will oppose the fiscal and monetary integration required to stabilize the eurozone if they think their money will be spent on subsidizing poor countries on Europe’s periphery that refuse to cooperate on refugees and fail to abide by EU laws.
The only way to convince German voters that their money will not be misdirected would be to create separate political institutions and a separate budget for the eurozone.
This is the proposal advanced by French President Emmanuel Macron and supported in principle by Merkel.
But plans for such a two-track Europe can advance only if Merkel can overcome German nationalists who want to break up the single currency, and only if Macron can silence integrationist zealots in Brussels who want to force all EU countries to join the eurozone.
At first sight, simultaneous progress on many fronts seems too much to hope for.
After all, if the necessary breakthroughs in France, Germany, Britain, and Brussels were each a 50-50 coin-toss, the probability of all four coins landing “heads” would be only 6.25%.
Fortunately, there are at least two reasons for dismissing such apparently logical scepticism.
First, the political and economic decisions that leaders across Europe now face are anything but independent.
What happens in Paris, London, and Brussels will depend crucially on the government program that Merkel negotiates with her eventual coalition partners in Berlin.
And Germany’s coalition agreement will, in turn, depend on Macron’s diplomatic skills in advocating a distinct politico-economic identity for the eurozone.
Equally important, the EU bureaucracy will have to embrace – enthusiastically – the concept of a two-track Europe.
This means abandoning the assumption that all EU members are heading for the same destination, and an end to treating non-euro countries as second-class laggards (described condescendingly as “pre-ins”).
Now, suppose that EU leaders recognized that the only feasible way to maintain European stability and progress would be by adopting the two-track or “concentric circles” model, with a more politically integrated eurozone surrounded by a looser economic confederation of non-euro countries.
Under these circumstances, Britain would be likely to change its mind about Brexit.
Failing that, Britain would spend several years in a transition limbo and would then almost certainly re-join Sweden, Denmark, Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic in the outer ring of EU countries that object to the pooling of sovereignty required by the euro.
This outer orbit would also attract Norway and Switzerland through the irresistible pull of economic gravity.
This points to the second reason to believe that EU leaders could achieve simultaneous political and economic breakthroughs across Europe.
The necessary decisions in Paris, Berlin, London, and Brussels are not just a random coin toss.
There are strong incentives for voters and political leaders in all democratic countries to take decisions that support economic prosperity and political stability, once it becomes obvious that all the alternatives are economically damaging or politically dangerous.
This is the point that French voters arguably reached in April when they elected Macron, and a similar turning point is rapidly approaching in Britain, as the risks and contradictions of Brexit become ever clearer.
All that remains is for Germany to recognize that its prosperity and security depends on a more integrated eurozone inside a more flexible EU.
Europe Between Trump and Xi
PARIS – The most recent World Trade Organization ministerial conference, held in December in Buenos Aires, Argentina, was a fiasco.
Despite a limited agenda, the participants were unable to produce a joint statement.
But not everyone was disappointed by that outcome: China maintained a diplomatic silence, while the United States seemed to celebrate the meeting’s failure.
This is bad news for Europe, which was virtually alone in expressing its discontent.
It is often pointed out that, in the face of US President Donald Trump’s blinkered protectionism, the European Union has an opportunity to assume a larger international leadership role, while strengthening its own position in global trade.
The free-trade agreement recently signed with Japan will give the EU a clear advantage over the US in agriculture, and strengthening trade ties with Mexico could have a similar impact, as the US renegotiates the North American Free Trade Agreement.
Some suggest that, to strengthen its position further, Europe should team up with China, which, despite its reticence at the WTO conference, has lately attempted to position itself as a champion of multilateralism.
A Sino-European partnership could be a powerful force offsetting America’s negative impact on international trade and cooperation.
Yet such a partnership is far from certain.
Yes, Europe and China converge on a positive overall view of globalization and multilateralism.
But whereas Europe supports a kind of “offensive multilateralism” that seeks to beef up existing institutions’ rules and enforcement mechanisms, China resists changes to existing standards, especially if they strengthen enforcement of rules that might constrain its ability to maximize its own advantages.
Europe’s desire to force China to adhere to common rules aligns its interests more closely with the US, with which it shares many of the same grievances, from China’s continued subsidization of private enterprises to the persistence of barriers to market access.
According to one recent study, market access barriers erected by China have taken a high toll on the growth of EU exports.
But the US and the EU do not have the same vision for how to address these grievances.
In order to limit abuse of WTO rules by China, Europe’s leaders want to be able to negotiate new, clearer rules, either through the framework of a bilateral investment agreement or through a plurilateral agreement on public procurement.
Trump does not want to reform the system; he wants to sink it.
In fact, with Trump seeking to use bilateral deals to secure reductions in America’s trade deficit, the possibility that the US will leave the WTO altogether – a nightmare scenario for the EU, which advocates shared norms over force – cannot be excluded.
Trump’s predecessor, Barack Obama, had his own solution.
New multilateral frameworks – the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) with Asia and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) with the EU – would circumscribe China’s room for maneuver.
As such frameworks brought about regulatory convergence, the US and the EU would be able to define the standards of the emerging new global economy, forcing China either to accept those standards or be left behind.
But this project has now been fatally undermined.
Obama’s effort to finalize both agreements before the end of his presidency, though understandable, bred serious concerns about hastiness.
Europeans recognized that full regulatory convergence between the US and the EU would, in reality, take at least a decade.
So, under pressure from their citizens, European leaders began to express concern about what the TTIP was lacking in terms of, say, environmental and sanitary regulations and transparency.
Given their shared interest in regulatory convergence, particularly to strengthen their position vis-à-vis China, the US, and the EU will eventually have to resume cooperation toward that end.
But, as long as Trump is in power, advocating bilateral reciprocity over multilateralism, such an effort will probably be impossible.
Instead, Trump’s America will most likely continue to take advantage of its far-reaching commercial influence to secure strategic or political gains.
On this front, Europe is at a significant disadvantage.
The EU is, after all, not a state, and it does not speak on international matters with one voice.
It is not out of the question that the Chinese, who speak the language of realpolitik fluently, would prefer to meet the ad hoc demands of the Americans over the multilateral conditions of the Europeans.
In this context, the EU’s top priority should be to unify the positions of its member states, with the goal of overcoming the barriers erected by the US and creating shared systems for constraining China.
But that is easier said than done.
As it stands, many EU countries resist the introduction of any trade restrictions, whether owing to an excessive commitment to liberal economic ideals or fear of jeopardizing their own interests in China by, say, establishing an EU mechanism for managing foreign investment.
The emergence of “illiberal” governments in Central and Eastern Europe complicates matters further for the EU.
These governments have no interest in any form of multilateralism, as they have embraced a narrow view of their interests.
They often seem fascinated by the logic of realpolitik espoused by Trump, Chinese President Xi Jinping, and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Moreover, these countries’ pursuit of their commercial interests could come at the expense of EU procurement rules.
And they are not alone within the EU.
Greece, for example, has accepted large amounts of Chinese investment.
The EU then refused to mention China explicitly in a resolution on the conflict in the South China Sea.
To be sure, European countries are not wrong to welcome Chinese investment.
But China should be reciprocating, offering European investment in China a warmer welcome.
That is why the EU and China should work to complete the bilateral investment treaty that they have been negotiating for years, with limited progress.
Such a treaty should rely on reciprocal rules, including the dismantling of barriers to China’s market.
French President Emmanuel Macron is trying to advance offensive multilateralism.
But unless the EU as a whole embraces the cause, Europe – caught between China, which has a very conservative but outdated interpretation of multilateralism, and Trump, who wants to get rid of it – risks becoming a casualty.
Securing Post-Brexit Europe
MADRID – It is said that good things come to those who wait.
If so, then the European Union’s new Global Strategy on Foreign and Security Policy, more than a decade overdue, must be a very good thing.
Actually, it is exactly what Europe needs.
But the timing of its release – in the immediate aftermath of the United Kingdom’s vote to leave the EU – could relegate it to irrelevance.
How the EU moves forward with the strategy will be a bellwether for the future of the European project.
The strategy, developed by Federica Mogherini, High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, does precisely what it should: it provides a coherent guiding vision and a flexible framework for adopting concrete policies.
It strikes the ideal balance between realism and ambition, recognizing the EU’s limitations and pinpointing the improvements that are needed.
The strategy’s grounded perspective is apparent from the first sentence: “We need a stronger Europe.”
This signals a major shift from the previous, outdated strategy, issued in 2003, whose much-maligned opening sentence declared, “Europe has never been so prosperous, so secure, nor so free.”
Specifically, the strategy emphasizes the importance of the EU’s enduring soft power, in which prospective enlargement plays an important role, while acknowledging that soft power alone is not enough to ensure security.
Moreover, it implicitly establishes the right sequence for the development of the EU’s approach to the world, by offering a far more specific vision for addressing regional challenges than it does for global challenges.
The message is clear: the EU needs to get its act together within its neighborhood before it can grasp a broader role.
All of this is well and good, but it will amount to nothing if EU leaders do not “join up,” as Mogherini puts it, to ensure that the strategy fulfills its potential.
And, so far, the outlook does not look particularly promising.
“Brexit,” which has thrown global markets into turmoil and raised serious questions about the Union’s future, has eclipsed the release of the security strategy, which barely got a mention in the conclusions of the latest European Council summit.
Making matters worse, instead of inspiring much-needed soul-searching among EU leaders, the British referendum seems to have spurred many to allow national political interests, not to mention personal ambitions, to guide their thinking.
This self-serving impulse was on display in European Parliament President Martin Schulz’s fiery comments calling for the UK to invoke Article 50 (the withdrawal procedure) immediately – a move surely intended as a shot across the bow of his political rival, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who had called for deliberation and time.
It can also be seen in French President François Hollande’s tough posturing, which seems motivated by the expectation of a battle with the far-right National Front’s Marine Le Pen in next year’s presidential election.
And it is abundantly clear in the struggle between the European Council and the European Commission for control over the forthcoming Brexit negotiations, in which the Council is concerned primarily about upholding the autonomy of the member states.
This is precisely the kind of short-sightedness that has long undermined the EU’s image in the world and, by reinforcing the impression of fecklessness and ineptitude, in the member states as well.
If it continues, Brexit could, as the doomsayers warn, be the EU’s downfall.
If, instead, EU leaders rise to the challenge that Brexit poses and come together to realize the vision set out in the new global strategy, the EU could emerge from this tumultuous period stronger than ever.
In uncertain times, Europe must decide how it will address the existential challenges it faces.
The sensible way forward is to minimize weaknesses by maximizing collective strengths.
The alternative – for each country to go its own way, as the British have chosen to do – would be reckless.
But the most dangerous approach – the one that would bring the most strife and insecurity – would be to continue pretending to be united, while acting independently.
Already, EU leaders have missed an important opportunity.
They could have woven the process of defining Europe’s aspirations, and of drafting a security strategy that reflected them, into broader discussions of what the EU should be, including at the most recent European Council summit.
They should not also miss the opportunity presented by the strategy that has been produced.
Such opportunities do not come along every day.
Whether the new EU strategy symbolizes the start of a new chapter for Europe or a dead letter about a defunct project will depend on whether European leaders can overcome their parochialism and commit to cooperation.
The early returns are not promising.
Tackling Migration at the Source
WASHINGTON, DC – For citizens of poor countries, migration often is a highly appealing option.
The journey to a new country is often perilous, but it promises far greater economic opportunity: average per capita incomes in advanced economies can be more than 50 times higher (in terms of purchasing power parity) than those in the developing world.
In many cases, migrants’ physical security improves as well.
Yet, for recipient countries, immigration remains a contentious topic, with governments struggling to settle on policies that will enable their economies to reap the benefits and avoid incurring excessive costs.
Immigration is a particularly salient topic of political debate in Europe and the United States.
Even in Japan, which has largely closed its borders to migrants, the need to find ways to cope with rapid population aging has lately been stimulating discussion of the issue.
In all of these countries, the debate tends to boil down to three basic positions.
The first – espoused by a small minority, and lacking significant political support – is that immigration is fundamentally beneficial to an advanced country, as newcomers can mitigate demographic challenges and contribute to the economy’s skills base.
The second position is precisely the opposite: immigration should be prevented by all available means.
Proponents of this view often argue that migrants drive down wages, particularly at the lower end of the income distribution, undermining natives’ living standards.
They also argue that migrants dilute the recipient country’s culture and traditions – a claim with an emotional pull that economists often underestimate.
The third position falls somewhere between these extremes.
It recognizes the potential benefits of some immigration, but calls for strict proficiency tests, to ensure that only migrants who can fill a skills gap in the recipient country are accepted.
That way, immigration will improve the quality of supply in the labor market and boost firms’ competitiveness, without generating cultural pressures.
Of course, this approach looks quite different from the perspective of migrants’ home countries, which lose not only valuable skilled labor, but also any resources invested in that labor, say, through the education system.
While a country may benefit from its expatriates’ remittances, it is the migrants alone who secure the overall benefits of relocating.
In any case, when advanced countries accept only a small number of skilled migrants, they do nothing to diminish the pressure that drives migration flows, which overwhelmingly comprise people who lack the new country’s required skills.
And those pressures are powerful, as demonstrated by the tragic situation in the Mediterranean Sea, where more than a thousand refugees on the treacherous route from Africa to Europe died in the first four months of this year.
If these pressures are allowed to persist, many migrants will ultimately make it to the developed world, one way or another.
And while immigration liberals are right that migrants will help to ease demographic pressures in recipient countries, the prohibitionists are right that the newcomers will place considerable cultural stress on their new communities, particularly in Europe.
This is why any solution to the migration challenge must focus on spurring development in migrants’ home countries.
For Europe, the focus should be on Africa, the main source of migration flows.
More rapid economic growth in Africa would, over time, greatly reduce the pressure that Europe faces.
Africa’s long-term development will of course require greater political stability and peace; in the meantime, however, there are steps that Europe can take to help spur growth.
While Africa has plenty of natural resources, it lacks the capital and knowhow needed to support a significant growth acceleration.
Public resources are simply inadequate to supply the bulk of that capital.
So, as has lately been recognized, investment must come from the private sector, as must critical skills and access to more developed markets.
But tapping private investment requires the public sector to take some enabling steps, joined by the philanthropic sector, which also has significant resources to contribute.
This is not to say that public investment and philanthropy should subsidize inherently unprofitable projects.
On the contrary, that would leave everyone worse off in the long run.
The goal should be to identify projects that, despite being economically profitable, are unattractive to private investors, owing to institutional and other barriers, and then work to remove those obstacles.
One key barrier to private investment in Africa is risk.
When the investment environment is considered uncertain, as is the case in most developing countries, investors demand a risk premium on virtually any project, even those with potentially high rates of return.
Individual project risk is, after all, very difficult to measure in such a context.
The public sector can help with risk-pooling measures such as carrying certain tranches of risk or providing insurance.
Such risk pooling, accompanied by institution-building across all sectors (not just health and education), could go a long way toward boosting economic growth and development in Africa and elsewhere.
The positive impact of this approach would be far-reaching – beginning with a reduction in migration pressure.
The impact would be even greater if new investment targeted areas with the largest number of displaced persons and migrants-in-waiting, as proposed by a new “Commission on Forced Displacement”.
Investment-driven growth is no substitute for conflict resolution and political stabilization; on the contrary, the former cannot be sustained without progress on the latter.
But an economic boost could serve as an important source of much-needed hope – and the start of a virtuous circle of peace and prosperity.
A New Growth Model for Europe’s Neighborhood
LONDON – More than ten years after the global financial crisis, the world economy is finally enjoying a broad-based recovery.
Europe and its broader neighborhood are no exception: economic growth in almost every country in Central and Eastern Europe, Central Asia, the Middle East, and North Africa, as well as in Russia and Turkey, has accelerated in the last year, and is projected to remain robust.
Yet new challenges loom.
If not addressed, these regions’ prospects will dim.
As the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development’s new Transition Report shows, before the Great Recession, the countries of Europe and its broader neighborhood were outperforming comparable emerging economies elsewhere.
In recent years, however, the tables have turned – and the gap is growing.
The explanation is straightforward.
Previously, Europe and its broader neighborhood enjoyed high total factor productivity (TFP) growth.
By eliminating many of the inefficiencies inherited from their socialist or otherwise dirigiste pasts, these countries were putting their capital and labor to increasingly good use.
Yet, by 2009, the low-hanging fruit had been picked, and investment in fixed capital had fallen below the levels in emerging economies elsewhere.
Faced with the large amounts of non-performing loans inherited from the crisis, countries shifted their attention to deleveraging, leaving investment and TFP growth to stall.
Countries in Europe and its broader neighborhood – even those whose economies are less developed – cannot base long-term growth on a low-wage comparative advantage.
Instead, they must lay the foundations of future-oriented growth models, underpinned by stronger human capital and innovation.
This demands, first and foremost, deeper integration into the global economy.
Nowadays, access to larger markets is vital to generating incentives for innovation and productivity growth.
European Union countries obviously benefit from the single market.
For emerging Europe and the countries of the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), however, taking advantage of economies of scale will require reduced trade barriers and better connectivity.
In concrete terms, this means that emerging Europe and the MENA region need to invest more in infrastructure.
And, in fact, according to the Transition Report’s estimates, these regions’ infrastructure investment requirements amount to about €2.2 trillion ($2.6 trillion).
To meet this need, fiscally constrained countries will have to mobilize private resources, via private-public partnerships.
Developed-country actors often worry that infrastructure investments in emerging economies may result in “roads to nowhere,” with money being channeled toward remote regions where nobody lives or from which existing residents are eager to leave, using those shiny new roads.
But this does not have to be the case.
Turkey is a case in point.
In 2002, the country launched a major effort to turn 25% of its road network into dual carriageways over the course of about ten years.
The EBRD’s Transition Report’s analysis shows that this investment has had a major impact on domestic trade and created jobs in the country’s previously underdeveloped eastern regions.
As countries attempt to attract financing for their own infrastructure projects, they should learn from – and highlight for potential donors – such successes.
Designing effective strategies for long-term infrastructure investment requires attention to another key area: the environment.
Countries must anticipate the regulatory changes that will arise, as they attempt, say, to meet their commitments under the Paris climate agreement.
This approach is in line with the market consensus.
Using the FTSE Russell Low Carbon Economy database, the ERBD found that while greener firms remain less profitable than their less sustainable counterparts – they are, after all, largely younger and smaller – they are growing faster.
Perhaps more important, we found that firms with a higher share of green revenues have higher stock-market valuations (price-to-earnings ratios), even if their current return on equity is lower than that of their non-green peers.
This suggests that investors expect stronger growth in greener market segments, or at least attach more value to supporting greener firms.
In places where fossil fuels are adequately priced, firms themselves also recognize the benefits of greener, more energy-efficient technologies.
Unfortunately, many countries still have in place substantial energy subsidies, which must be phased out to propel the shift toward a green economy.
To ensure that the neediest households do not suffer, the removal of subsidies can be offset by targeted assistance, as has been done recently in Belarus, Egypt, and Ukraine.
A new growth model for Europe’s neighborhood must also involve a rebalancing of the financial system.
Given the Great Recession’s legacy of non-performing loans, financing for new investment is more likely to come from equity than from debt.
Fortunately, equity investors are also oriented toward the long term, and are increasingly willing to buy greener assets.
Yet greater reliance on equity finance will require better state and corporate governance, underpinned by the rule of law.
Achieving that will be no easy feat. But EBRD research implies that, at least in the European neighborhood, progress would benefit not just the economy – including by promoting investment and innovation – but also the environment and society as a whole.
That is an investment worth making.
A Dramatic Comeback for Europe
LONDON – The Dutch are famous for building dykes that hold back the tides and storms sweeping across the Atlantic.
Have the Dutch now done it again, holding back the wave of populist politics that seemed to be threatening Europe after last year’s Brexit referendum and Donald Trump’s victory in the United States?
The unexpectedly weak performance of Geert Wilders’ Freedom Party (PVV) in the Dutch election on March 15 seems to suggest this.
Despite predictions running as high as 25% of the popular vote for Wilders, the PVV gained only 13%.
If voters in France’s upcoming presidential election prove closer to the Dutch than to Americans and Britons in their susceptibility to xenophobia and protectionism, their decision will have global implications for politics, economics, and the ideology of global capitalism.
A swing back to the center in continental Europe would strongly suggest that the unexpected victories for populist and anti-globalization movements in the US and Britain were not primarily a response to unemployment and disappointing economic performance since the financial crisis, mass migration, or the threat of Islamist terrorism.
This conclusion follows from the fact that France has suffered from much higher unemployment and a longer post-crisis recession than either the US or Britain, as well as experiencing more problems with terrorism and Islamic militancy.
If German voters in the autumn follow the French and Dutch in moving back toward the political center, immigration will also be discredited as the root cause of populism.
After all, Germany has experienced a much larger influx of foreigners than Britain or the US.
Instead, populism will look more like an Anglo-Saxon phenomenon, motivated less by immigration and economic policy than by conservative cultural attitudes among Trump and Brexit voters and the unusual demographic alliances pitting old against young, rural against urban, and university graduates against less educated voters in the US and Britain.
The economic implications will also be far-reaching if the center holds in Europe.
The European Union is a bigger trading partner than the US for most emerging economies.
And the euro is the only real alternative to the dollar as an international currency.
So the EU’s continuing commitment to a philosophy of open trade, globalization, and carbon reduction could be sufficient to prevent a paradigm shift toward protectionism and climate-change denial that seemed almost inevitable with Trump’s election.
Such a change in global leadership would require a dramatic improvement in Europe’s economic performance.
Fortunately, that outcome can be expected if voters reject populist politics in France and Germany.
The EU has suffered a prolonged economic slump since the 2008 financial crisis, largely because the German government vetoed the kind of monetary and fiscal stimulus that helped to pull the US out of recession in 2010.
Germany’s veto on US-style quantitative easing was also the main reason for the near-collapse of the single currency in 2012.
But a dramatic change to European policy and economic conditions occurred in March 2015, when the European Central Bank belatedly launched a bond-buying program similar to America’s, but on a far larger scale.
By purchasing almost three times the total net issuance of eurozone bonds, the ECB effectively circumvented eurozone rules and began to monetize Europe’s government deficits, as well as creating a mutual support system between strong economies such as Germany and weaker ones like Italy and Spain.
The ECB’s actions quickly reversed the fragmentation of the European banking system and eliminated fears of a euro breakup.
The immediate result was an upsurge in confidence among both businesses and consumers.
By last summer, most of Europe was already enjoying a decent recovery, when renewed fears of disintegration, this time caused by politics, not finance, suddenly overwhelmed the improvement in economic conditions.
Brexit and Trump created an expectation that Europe would be the next domino to fall to populism in the looming Dutch, French, and German elections.
Of course, this possibility still cannot be dismissed, which is why international investors remain cautious about Europe.
But if the populist victories that worry investors do not in fact happen, a surge of business and consumer confidence will send waves of investment flowing into the eurozone.
The key event will be the final round of the French election on May 7.
If this results in a victory for Emmanuel Macron, the centrist front-runner, France will embark on a path leading to at least a modicum of economic reforms.
That, in turn, will create a much more cooperative relationship between France and Germany.
Both main candidates for German Chancellor are eager to rebuild post-Brexit Europe by strengthening the Franco-German axis – and the start of a French reform process would reassure German voters that their government, by easing EU austerity, would not merely be pouring money into a bottomless pit.
This brings us to the ideological implications if centrist forces win and economic recovery accelerates in Europe this year.
In the immediate aftermath of the global financial crisis, the European “social market” model of capitalism seemed like a logical alternative to the Thatcher-Reagan market fundamentalism that had broken down after 30 years of global dominance.
Indeed, President Barack Obama moved the US toward greater government activism in macroeconomic management, financial regulation, environmental policy, and health care.
Paradoxically, however, Europe moved in the opposite direction.
Under German pressure, the EU became the last bastion of monetarism, fiscal austerity, and the “disciplining” role of financial markets.
The result was the near-fatal euro crisis of 2010-2012.
If this year’s elections result in a centrist French president and a revival of Franco-German cooperation, the EU’s unexpected infatuation with market fundamentalism will probably end.
Europe will enjoy a better, more sustainable, and socially inclusive economic recovery than the US under Trump.
If this happens, the rest of the world may again start to see the EU as a source of inspiration and a model.
Europe’s Economic Dilemma
CAMBRIDGE – Europe faces a serious problem.
Although economic activity has recently increased, the eurozone has lost the ability to respond to the next downturn when it happens, as it inevitably will.
The European Central Bank deserves credit for the economic improvements that have occurred in the past few years.
In a speech at the annual gathering of central bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, in 2014, Mario Draghi, the ECB’s president, explained that three things could improve economic performance in Europe:
But Draghi went on to predict that Germany would not create a fiscal deficit and that Italy and France would not undertake the needed structural reforms.
He concluded that the ECB would have to stimulate growth by reducing interest rates, which would increase net exports by creating a more competitive euro.
The ECB has since taken the short-term interest rate into negative territory, cutting it from 0.2% in August 2014 to -0.3% now.
The ECB also bought long-term bonds for its portfolio, increasing the volume of its holdings from €2.2 trillion ($2.6 trillion) in 2014 to more than double that amount now.
The euro-dollar exchange rate fell from $1.39 in 2014 to a low of $1.04 in 2016, before recovering to the current level of $1.18.
The ECB’s negative-interest-rate policy also stimulated business investment and other spending that is sensitive to borrowing costs.
But the ECB’s policies also mean that it has no ammunition left to fight the next recession, which could be caused by a collapse of asset prices, starting with the price of long-term bonds.
German ten-year bond prices are extremely high, reflecting a current yield of less than 0.5%.
A fall in US stock and bond prices, which are also out of line with past experience, could cause European asset prices to decline in sympathy.
Alternatively, European exports could fall in response to geopolitical events in Asia or the Middle East, depressing overall economic activity in Europe.
An end to the US expansion, now in its ninth year, could pull down demand in Europe.
Although the US economy is now performing very well, the excessive level of asset prices – the result of a decade of near-zero interest rates – poses a threat to stability.
Whatever the cause of the next downturn, ECB policies that helped in the past would no longer be available.
The conventional response – reducing interest rates – is impossible, because current short-term interest rates in the eurozone countries are already near zero or negative.
To be sure, the ECB could expand its purchases of long-term bonds.
But doing so would not have the same effect that it did in the past.
One of the goals of large-scale bond purchases – so-called quantitative easing – was to drive down long-term interest rates in order to stimulate business investment and housing construction.
But with long-term interest rates now close to zero, bond purchases would not be able to lower them any further.
Another goal of lowering the yield on long-term bonds was to stimulate demand for equities.
Higher stock prices would lower the cost of equity-financed business investment and increase household wealth, thereby stimulating consumption.
This was never as successful in Europe as it was in the United States, where share ownership is more widespread.
But now, with long-term bond yields already close to zero, it could not even be tried.
In short, the ECB would be unable to respond to an economic downturn by lowering interest rates and buying long-term bonds.
And without the ability to reduce interest rates, the ECB also would be unable to stimulate net exports by reducing the value of the euro.
Whereas the US could respond to a new downturn with fiscal stimulus, it is difficult to see how this could be achieved in Europe.
The eurozone has no fiscal authority.
Each member country could of course reduce taxes and increase spending.
But much of the stimulus would spill over to the country’s trading partners through increased imports.
The result would be an increase in the country’s national debt with relatively little increase in its domestic demand.
An appropriate response to this dilemma may be a policy of coordinated fiscal expansion.
Each country would have to agree to a combination of tax cuts and increases in government spending scaled to the size of the economic downturn.
Waiting until the downturn occurs to plan this coordinated response would be a mistake.
All eurozone governments should place fiscal coordination with their European partners high on their agenda, before it is too late.
Europe’s Doom Loop in Reverse
BRUSSELS – During the 2011-2012 euro crisis, the currency area became mired in a “doom loop,” in which weak banks in financially distressed countries rationed credit, causing a recession that intensified pressure on government finances, which were already burdened by the need to cover banks’ losses.
But such self-reinforcing spirals can also operate in the opposite direction.
Understanding these dynamics may be the key to determining the eurozone’s relative strength today.
In a doom loop, the expectations of default drive up risk premia until the economy reaches the brink of collapse, even if the underlying problems could be managed over time.
At a certain point, when the gulf between financial-market pessimism and economic reality becomes too large, the market becomes ready for a reversal.
This was the case for the eurozone during the summer of 2012.
European Central Bank President Mario Draghi’s pledge to do “whatever it takes” to prevent the euro from disintegrating reassured markets so effectively because investors’ fear was largely based, to paraphrase US President Franklin D. Roosevelt, on “fear itself.”
Draghi’s intervention marked the start of a new cycle: the doom loop reversed, and became a benign credit cycle in which lower risk premia allowed both banks and governments to refinance at lower rates, making more credit available to the economy and thereby fueling a recovery that increased government revenue.
Governments in most of the eurozone countries that had previously been stuck in the doom loop were able to stabilize public finances without further expenditure cuts.
But this positive credit cycle is less visible than the doom loop, because it takes a lot less time to cut the number of borrowers and push the economy into a recession than to foster a recovery when credit becomes available again.
Even if over-stretched borrowers can spend and invest, they most likely won’t do so right away.
But, given time, easier credit conditions rarely fail to generate a recovery.
The ECB’s vast program of quantitative easing (QE), initiated in March 2015, reinforced the virtuous cycle.
But the truth is that the doom loop had been reversed long before QE began.
In any case, the common definition of that program – the large-scale purchase of government bonds by the ECB – is inaccurate.
The ECB General Council makes the key decisions, but its policy is executed mostly by national central banks (NCBs).
Normally, all NCBs in the euro system undertake the same operations, and the results are pooled.
But, when it comes to QE, each NCB buys only the bonds of its own government on its own account.
The Banca d’Italia has bought only Italian government bonds, and the Bundesbank only German Bunds.
NCBs are part of their respective countries’ larger public sectors, and eventually transfer all of the profits or losses from these transactions back to their own government.
So when they purchase long-term government bonds, they are acting like a subsidiary of a large corporation buying the debt of its parent company (issuing short-term liabilities to itself).
In short, the eurozone’s QE program amounts essentially to a massive asset-liability management exercise, in which (national) public debt is reshuffled from one part of the public sector (governments) to another part (the national central bank).
While the sums involved are very large – a total of about €2 trillion ($2.44 trillion) so far – the real impact is minor.
Of course, the ECB claims that the QE program contributed decisively to the recovery.
But the fact is that there has been little change in interest rates or risk spreads since the bond purchases started.
This indicates that the end of QE – which is likely to come later this year – will not mean the end of the recovery.
And, given that financial markets know that QE will end, they have already priced in that expectation.
But can today’s benign credit cycle last much longer?
There may be some reason for concern; after all, the eurozone experienced a similar self-reinforcing cycle of easy credit, growth, and little pressure on government finances before the global financial crisis of 2007-2008.
But it seems unlikely that the current cycle will lead to similar excesses and end in a similar bust, because the growth pattern in the peripheral eurozone countries has changed considerably.
During the pre-crisis credit boom, growth in countries like Spain and Portugal was based largely on domestic demand, financed by capital inflows.
In Italy, domestic demand was less exuberant, but foreign capital was still needed at the margin to finance a large public debt.
So when capital inflows suddenly stopped, these economies were thrown into crisis.
Today, however, growth in these countries is based mainly on exports, while domestic demand remains subdued.
Moreover, these countries are maintaining current-account surpluses while their growth rates rise; in other words, far from relying on fickle capital inflows, they are repaying their external debt.
This new, more robust growth model could be sustained until the remaining unemployment is absorbed.
No financial cycle lasts forever.
But the one driving today’s recovery in the eurozone, including the peripheral countries that were hardest hit by the crisis, may be set to persist for a while yet.
The Eurozone’s Hidden Strength
BRUSSELS – For years, the eurozone has been perceived as a disaster area, with discussions of the monetary union’s future often centered on a possible breakup.
When the British voted to leave the European Union last year, they were driven partly by the perception of the eurozone as a dysfunctional – and perhaps unsalvageable – project.
Yet, lately, the eurozone has become the darling of financial markets – and for good reason.
The discovery of the eurozone’s latent strength was long overdue.
Indeed, the eurozone has been recovering from the crisis of 2011-2012 for several years.
On a per capita basis, its economic growth now outpaces that of the United States.
The unemployment rate is also declining – more slowly than in the US, to be sure, but that partly reflects a divergence in labor-force participation trends.
Whereas labor-force participation in the eurozone is on the rise, it has been declining in the US since around 2000.
The departure of Americans from the job market reflects what economists call the “discouraged worker” phenomenon.
And, indeed, the trend has accelerated since the recession of 2009.
In principle, declining labor-force participation should be a problem in the eurozone, too, given the prolonged period of very high unemployment that many European workers have faced.
But, in the last five years, 2.5 million people in the eurozone have actually joined the labor force, as five million jobs were created, reducing the overall decline in unemployment by half.
Moreover, the eurozone recovery has been sustained, somewhat unexpectedly, even in the absence of continuous fiscal stimulus.
The heated discussions about austerity of recent years have been misplaced, with both critics and official cheerleaders overestimating the amount of austerity applied.
The average cyclically adjusted fiscal deficit has been roughly constant since 2014, at around 1% of GDP.
Of course, large differences in the fiscal position of individual member states remain.
But this is to be expected in such a diverse monetary union.
The truth is that even France, often considered a weak performer, has deficit and debt levels comparable to those of the US.
A comparison with the US, as well as with Japan, also undercuts the common perception that the eurozone’s fiscal rules, including the (in)famous Stability and Growth Pact and the 2012 “fiscal compact,” have been irrelevant.
True, no country has been officially reprimanded for excessive deficits or debts.
But the clamor over rule breaches at the margin has overshadowed the broad underlying trend toward sound public finances that the fiscal rules have fostered.
All of this suggests that the “soft austerity” pursued in many eurozone countries may have been the right choice after all.
To be sure, one should not overestimate the eurozone’s long-term economic strength.
While the average growth rate might remain above 2% for the next few years, as the remaining unemployed are absorbed and the long-term trend of older workers rejoining the labor market continues, the pool of unused labor will eventually be exhausted.
Once the eurozone has reached the so-called “Lewis turning point” – when surplus labor is depleted and wages start to rise – growth rates will fall to a level that better reflects demographic dynamics.
And those dynamics aren’t particular desirable: the eurozone’s working-age population is set to decline by about half a percentage point per year over the next decade at least.
Yet, even then, the eurozone’s per capita growth rate is unlikely to be much lower than that of the US, because the difference in their productivity growth rates is now minor.
In this sense, the eurozone’s future may look more like Japan’s present, characterized by headline annual growth of a little over 1% and stubbornly low inflation, but per capita income growth similar to that of the US or Europe.
Fortunately for the eurozone, it will enter this period of high employment and slow growth on sound footing – thanks, in part, to that controversial austerity.
By contrast, both the US and Japan are facing full employment with fiscal deficits higher than 3% of GDP – about 2-3 percentage points higher than those of the eurozone.
The US and Japan also have heavier debt burdens: the debt-to-GDP ratio stands at 107% in the US and more than 200% in Japan, compared to 90% in the eurozone.
There is evidence that in the wake of a financial crisis, when monetary policy becomes ineffective – for example, because nominal interest rates are at the zero bound – deficit spending can have an unusually strong stabilizing impact.
But there remains a key unresolved issue: once financial markets have normalized, will maintaining a deficit for a long time provide continuous stimulus?
The fact that the eurozone’s recovery is now catching up with that of the US, despite its lack of any continuing stimulus, suggests that the answer is no.
Indeed, the experience of the eurozone suggests that while concerted fiscal stimulus can make a difference during an acute recession, withdrawing that stimulus when it is no longer vital is preferable to maintaining it indefinitely.
With austerity – that is, reducing the deficit, once the recession has ended – recovery might take longer to become consolidated; but once it is, economic performance is even more stable, because the government’s accounts are in a sustainable position.
John Maynard Keynes famously said, “In the long run, we are all dead.”
That may be true, on a long enough timeline.
But it is no excuse to dismiss longer-term considerations.
In fact, for the eurozone, the long run seems to have arrived – and the economy is still alive and kicking.
The Eurozone Must Reform or Die
OXFORD – With the election of a reform-minded centrist president in France and the re-election of German Chancellor Angela Merkel seeming ever more likely, is there hope for the stalled single-currency project in Europe?
Perhaps, but another decade of slow growth, punctuated by periodic debt-related convulsions, still looks more likely.
With a determined move toward fiscal and banking union, things could be much better.
But, in the absence of policies to strengthen stability and sustainability, the chances of an eventual collapse are much greater.
True, in the near term, there is much reason for optimism.
Over the past year, the eurozone has been enjoying a solid cyclical recovery, outperforming expectations more than any other major advanced economy.
And make no mistake: the election of Emmanuel Macron is a landmark event, raising hopes that France will re-energize its economy sufficiently to become a full and equal partner to Germany in eurozone governance.
Macron and his economic team are full of promising ideas, and he will have a huge majority in the National Assembly to implement them (though it will help if the Germans give him leeway on budget deficits in exchange for reform).
In Spain, too, economic reform is translating into stronger long-term growth.
But all is not well.
Greece is still barely growing, after experiencing one of the worst recessions in history, although those who blame this on German austerity clearly have not looked at the numbers: with encouragement from left-leaning US economists, Greece mismanaged perhaps the softest bailout package in modern history.
Italy has done far better than Greece, but that is a backhanded compliment; real income is actually lower than a decade ago (albeit it is hard to know for sure, given the country’s vast underground economy).
For southern Europe as a whole, the single currency has proved to be a golden cage, forcing greater fiscal and monetary rectitude but removing the exchange rate as a critical cushion against unexpected shocks.
Indeed, part of the reason the United Kingdom’s economy has held up well (so far) since last year’s Brexit referendum is that the pound fell sharply, boosting competitiveness.
The UK, of course, famously (and wisely) opted out of the single currency even as it is now moving (not so wisely) to withdraw from the European Union and the single market entirely.
It is now fairly obvious that the euro was not necessary to the success of the EU, and instead has proved a massive impediment, as many economists on this side of the Atlantic had predicted.
Eurocrats have long likened European integration to riding a bicycle: one must keep moving forward or fall down.
If so, the premature adoption of the single currency is best thought of as a detour through thick, wet cement.
Ironically, by far the main reason why euro adoption was originally so popular in Southern Europe was that back in the 1980s and 1990s, ordinary people longed for the price stability Germans enjoyed with their Deutsche Mark.
But, while the euro has been accompanied by a dramatic eurozone wide fall in inflation, most other countries have managed to bring down inflation without it.
Far more important to the achievement of price stability has been the advent of the modern independent central bank, a device that has helped dramatically reduce inflation levels worldwide.
Yes, a few places, such as Venezuela, still have triple-digit price growth, but they are now rarities.
It is very likely that if, instead of joining the euro, Italy and Spain had simply granted their central banks more autonomy, they, too, would have low inflation today.
Greece is admittedly a less obvious case; but, considering that many poor African countries have been able to keep inflation well within single digits, one can presume that Greece would have managed as well.
Indeed, if Southern European countries had kept their own currencies, they might never have dug as big a debt hole, and would have had the option of partial default through inflation.
The question now is how to maneuver the EU out of the wet cement.
Although many European politicians are loath to admit it, the status quo is probably not sustainable; eventually, there must be either significantly greater fiscal integration or a chaotic break-up.
It is astonishingly naive to think the euro will not face further real-life stress tests over the next 5-10 years, if not sooner.
If the status quo is ultimately unsustainable, why are markets so supremely calm, with ten-year Italian government bonds yielding less than two percentage points more than Germany’s?
Perhaps the small spread reflects investors’ belief that outright bailouts are eventually coming, however much German politicians protest to the contrary.
European Central Bank purchases of periphery countries’ debt already constitute an implicit subsidy, and discussion of Eurobonds is heating up with Macron’s victory.
Or perhaps investors are gambling that the South has walked too far into the cement to get out.
Germany will just keep squeezing their budgets in order to ensure that its banks are repaid.
Either way, eurozone leaders would be better off taking action now, rather than waiting for the single currency’s next moment of truth.
How long today’s optimism lasts is for Macron and Merkel to decide.
A European Economic Miracle?
LONDON – A couple of years ago, the eurozone – about one-sixth of the world economy – appeared to be in serious trouble.
Beginning in 2010, an unexpected sovereign debt crisis contributed to and was compounded by serious weaknesses in major banks.
Fiscal austerity, in Greece and other relatively weak countries, helped fuel an overall economic downturn.
In the absence of generous mutual support, there was an aura of last-ditch desperation when, in March 2015, the European Central Bank announced an ambitious program of purchasing government debt.
Just over two years later, the situation looks much more positive.
The latest International Monetary Fund forecast projects 1.7% growth for the eurozone as a whole in 2017, and 1.6% growth in 2018 – a remarkable improvement from a few years ago, when the region struggled to break 1%.
Recent solvency concerns for some smaller banks in Italy and Spain were handled without causing any significant disruption.
And, at a just-concluded ECB conference that I attended, there was even some discussion of when the ECB could scale back its interventions and perhaps begin to raise interest rates. (All the sessions were on the record and live webcast.)
The immediate macroeconomic picture remains somewhat murky.
On the morning of June 27, financial markets thought ECB President Mario Draghi spoke more positively on growth than in the recent past, and the value of the euro strengthened significantly.
By the next morning, senior ECB officials were quoted as saying that Draghi’s remarks had been overinterpreted – and the euro fell.
The real question is what comes next, and this was the theme of the conference: what should we expect in terms of Europe’s medium-term growth potential?
In particular, as long as interest rates remain low, the current level of government debt in countries such as Italy remains manageable. But as interest rates rise, will there be sufficient growth to sustain the expectation that public debt levels are sustainable?
The pro-growth achievements of the past few years are real.
The ECB’s low (in fact, negative) interest-rate policies helped sustain credit in general and ensure continued financing of government deficits in particular.
This took pressure off fiscal policy – and there has been less austerity than previously seemed likely.
Banks have been gradually placed on a stronger footing, with more loss-absorbing equity capital.
There is also some evidence that competition in product markets has increased, perhaps owing to more relaxed regulation.
There is also bad news, although not all of it is specific to the eurozone.
Across industrial countries, there has been a slowdown in productivity growth – and therefore in overall economic growth – which now appears to have started around the year 2000.
The precise explanation remains elusive, but the prevailing view is that while the advent of new information technology had some definite positive impact on productivity in the 1990s, the gains have not proved sufficiently long-lived or widespread.
In addition, the precise pattern of technological change has put pressure on the middle class everywhere – by reducing the demand for workers who have only a secondary-school education.
This implies weak growth and widening inequality, a combination that could further undermine education and skill levels.
At the same time, European demographic trends are a source of concern.
An aging population means more retirees – expecting publicly provided pensions – relative to the number of economically active people.
Europe has experienced significant immigration from countries such as Syria, Libya, and Afghanistan; but many of the newcomers have little education, and finding them employment has proved difficult.
More innovation could definitely help.
Even pessimists acknowledge the incipient wave of technology in life sciences, artificial intelligence, and robotics around the world.
But as China continues to emerge as a research powerhouse, there is increasing pressure on Europe to keep up.
It would be a mistake to count Europe out yet. Its human capital is sound, good health care is available to more people than in the US, and stronger companies are emerging through the process of integrating national markets.
Moreover, Britain’s decision to leave the European Union seems to have concentrated continental leaders’ minds.
No one wants to repeat the policy missteps of 2010-2014. French President Emmanuel Macron is proposing a stronger central authority, including a potential finance ministry.
Whether the Germans will agree remains far from clear, but it is worth recalling that building a fiscal union in the US took a very long time (and in some senses may remain an unfinished project).
The greatest cause for concern could turn out to be imbalances within the eurozone.
The German economy is strong: 1.5-1.6% growth, near-full employment, and a large current-account surplus.
Spain’s economy is greatly improved, experiencing 2.6% growth, but unemployment remains stubbornly – and disturbingly – high, at around 18%.
Italy remains the big question, with the IMF forecasting GDP growth of 0.8% this year and next.
Can northern Italy’s family firms again prove themselves capable of growth in increasingly tough international markets?
Will the next wave of new technology help or hurt them?
France, too, remains something of a wildcard.
Will Macron’s stunning makeover of French politics lead to growth-enhancing reforms?
If not, Germany may be less inclined to meet Macron halfway on eurozone integration.
Above all, the eurozone – or perhaps the EU – must find ways to ensure that everyone grows and benefits from growth.
Whether it will succeed or not cannot be known. What is certain is that in an environment like the current one, where the worst has passed, the task has become easier.
Big Oil, Big Tobacco, Big Lies
BOSTON – Over the last few years, a growing number of people have been taking a hard look at what is happening to our planet – historic droughts, rising sea levels, massive floods – and acknowledging, finally, that human activity is propelling rapid climate change.
But guess what?
Exxon (now ExxonMobil) had an inkling of this as early as 1978.
By the early 1980s, Exxon scientists had much more than an inkling.
They not only understood the science behind climate change, but also recognized the company’s own outsize role in driving the phenomenon.
Recognizing the potential effects as “catastrophic” for a significant portion of the population, they urged Exxon’s top executives to take action.
Instead, the executives buried the truth.
There may be a silver lining to this infuriating story: the recent investigation that exposed Exxon’s deceit could end up catalyzing the action needed to address the looming climate crisis.
After all, similar revelations about the tobacco industry – what the major cigarette companies knew and when they knew it – transformed the public-health landscape.
In 1996, a series of lawsuits forced tobacco companies to release millions of internal documents, which confirmed what public-health advocates and policymakers had long suspected: as early as the 1950s, the industry knew that nicotine was addictive and that cigarettes caused cancer.
But, to protect its own interests, Big Tobacco deliberately misled the public, doing everything possible to cast doubt on scientific findings that it knew to be accurate.
Such tactics enabled the industry to delay, for more than 50 years, regulation that could have saved millions of lives annually.
After the revelations, however, it was clear that the tobacco industry was a malevolent force that did not belong in the policymaking process.
With Big Tobacco out of the picture, and armed with evidence of the real effects of tobacco consumption, health advocates were finally able to compel their governments to act.
In 2003, world leaders agreed to the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC), negotiated under the auspices of the World Health Organization.
Today, the treaty covers 90% of the world’s population and has contributed to a significant decline in sales for global tobacco corporations.
Over time, it will save hundreds of millions of lives (and save governments’ health-care budgets huge sums).
Big Oil, it is now clear, has been following Big Tobacco’s playbook.
In 1997, almost two decades after it began studying climate change, it quashed its research, claiming that climate science was “far from clear” and thus that it did not “support mandated cuts in energy use.”
Beyond suppressing its own findings, ExxonMobil (and its peers) funded and promoted junk science and attacked scientists who warned of the impending climate disaster.
The fossil-fuel companies’ approach was so effective that the media are only now beginning to recognize the leading role the industry played in creating – almost out of whole cloth – the so-called “climate debate.”
But perhaps Big Oil’s biggest success was diminishing the political will to implement appropriate regulation.
Even after the international community adopted the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in 1992, the fossil-fuel industry managed to block meaningful progress – to the point that, if serious action is not taken soon, the entire process could unravel.
In Europe, Royal Dutch Shell’s lobbying so diluted the European Union’s efforts that there are now no binding targets for renewables or energy efficiency for individual countries.
The company even sent a letter to the European Commission’s president claiming that “gas is good for Europe.”
Shell and other oil companies are now promising to work as “advisers” to national governments on how to deal with climate change.
Just as the tobacco files drove the tobacco industry out of policymaking processes, the Exxon investigation should compel world leaders to eliminate the fossil-fuel industry from efforts to solve the climate crisis.
After all, no policy can succeed if those who shape it are betting on its failure.
The turning point for tobacco-related public-health policy came when the industry’s depravity became indisputable.
Now, that moment has come for the climate movement.
We cannot simply hope that the fossil-fuel industry will change its ways.
As an alliance of human-rights groups, environmental activists, and corporate-accountability advocates already is demanding, we must kick the industry out of the policymaking process altogether.
Exxon’s scientists were right: the effects of climate change on many communities are catastrophic.
With so many lives at stake – and such clear evidence of the threat – Big Oil, like Big Tobacco before it, should be treated for what it is: Big Trouble.
Making Journalism Great Again
OXFORD – In the debate over the future of journalism, “fake news” has taken center stage, with storylines featuring a ranting American president, Russian communication “bots,” and betrayal and subterfuge competing for public attention.
But in an era of diminishing profits and shrinking audiences, is fake news really the biggest threat that traditional media face?
In a news environment increasingly prone to hyperventilation, it can be difficult to separate fact from fabricated or deliberately skewed content shared via social media.
The proliferation of “bots” – computer programs that automatically spread disinformation – has blurred these lines further.
And as the methods of manipulation multiply, the problem is only likely to worsen.
And yet the near-constant focus on fake news has distracted many in the industry from more serious challenges confronting professional journalism.
The erosion of business models and growing dependence on third-party digital distributors – like Facebook and Google – have handcuffed news organizations and cut deeply into their profits.
Worse, audiences no longer trust the information presented to them.
This suggests that the problem is bigger than fake news.
In fact, large, traditional, or legacy media organizations still trump social media as trusted sources.
As the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism’s Digital News Report 2017 revealed, 40% of news consumers say that established media organizations – The New York Times, for example – accurately differentiate fact from fiction.
For social media, this share is only 24%.
But this also means that 60% of news consumers regard the legacy media as being careless with facts.
That statistic alone should be a cause for grave concern to everyone in the industry.
According to the report – which surveyed some 70,000 Internet users in 36 countries – 29% of respondents said they were avoiding news altogether.
For many, this was either because producers’ preference for negative stories put them in a bad mood, or because they viewed the reporting as politically slanted and therefore untrustworthy.
Without trust, there is no audience; and without an audience, there is no business.
If the survey’s results are representative of broader trends, one of the world’s most important pillars of democracy – a free and open press – is in jeopardy.
Perhaps this should come as no surprise.
In the digital era, trust deficits have affected most major institutions, from political parties and big companies to religious organizations and universities.
This could be a sign of a more informed and critical citizenry; or, more likely, it could be a response to feeling overwhelmed by choice and powerless in a complex world.
But what has changed for news organizations is that, thanks to social media, they no longer have a monopoly on holding the powerful to account.
On the contrary, they have come to be identified with the powerful – part of a media-business-political elite divorced from the concerns of ordinary people.
Having become a target of popular anger, journalism will need to “disrupt” itself to regain credibility and restore audiences’ trust.
To this end, media organizations should take at least six steps.
For starters, news outlets must set their own agendas, rather than wasting resources on pursuing someone else’s.
The international investigation that led to the Panama Papers and the Paradise Papers are brilliant examples of journalism that is relevant and interesting – two fundamental criteria that all reporting should meet.
Second, reporters have a responsibility to their audiences to analyze what powerful actors are doing, rather than what they are saying.
As the Washington Post’s media columnist Margaret Sullivan recently observed, coverage of US President Donald Trump has focused narrowly on his words, at the expense of his policy.
Third, the media must become better listeners.
Journalists’ distinction between “reporting” and “reporting on the ground” highlights the reality that a sizable proportion of newsroom staff never leave their desks.
Journalists don’t necessarily do this by choice; many are glued to their screens because their companies lack resources, or force them to follow and report on twitter feeds.
In a sense, reporters’ behavior is merely a symptom of an editorial pathology.
Fourth, news organizations must engage audiences – talking to them, not down to them.
Very often, the news cycle is driven by assumptions about what viewers or readers might like, rather than what they actually want.
Diversity in a newsroom is vital to broadening the relevance of its coverage.
Fifth, in the rush to experiment with new forms of storytelling, some media companies are forgetting their mission.
News outlets should forego expensive, flashy projects if they do little to further audiences’ understanding of a story.
Finally, rebuilding trust will require a new definition of news itself.
When audiences feel overwhelmed by information and complexity, the response can be to tune out.
The media must give people a reason to tune back in.
(One example: positive news is dramatically undervalued in today’s media environment.)
If traditional media outlets allow themselves to be defined by the fake-news debate, they, too, will be overwhelmed.
So long as social media companies optimize for advertising revenue, their algorithms will tend to reward the extremes, and news organizations will waste valuable resources battling disinformation.
A better approach would be to make news less boring.
Reputable media companies have always sought to capitalize on facts: the scoop, the exclusive interview, the probing investigation.
Truth, like trust, is a commodity.
The future of the industry depends on getting better at producing it.
Free Speech and Fake News
PRINCETON – About a week before the United States presidential election last November, someone posted on Twitter that Hillary Clinton was at the center of a pedophilia ring.
The rumor spread through social media, and a right-wing talk show host named Alex Jones repeatedly stated that she was involved in child abuse and that her campaign chairman, John Podesta, took part in satanic rituals.
In a YouTube video (since removed), Jones referred to “all the children Hillary Clinton has personally murdered and chopped up and raped.”
The video, posted four days before the election, was watched more than 400,000 times.
Emails released by WikiLeaks showed that Podesta sometimes dined at a Washington, DC, pizza restaurant called Comet Ping Pong.
Apparently for that reason the child-sex-ring accusations focused on the pizza restaurant and used the hashtag #pizzagate.
The allegations were frequently retweeted by bots – programs designed to spread certain types of messages – contributing to the impression that many people were taking “Pizzagate” seriously.
The story, amazingly, was also retweeted by General Michael Flynn, who is soon to be President-elect Donald Trump’s national security adviser.
Even after Trump’s election – and despite debunking by the New York Times and the Washington Post – the story continued to spread.
Comet Ping Pong was harassed by constant, abusive, and often threatening phone calls.
When the manager approached the DC police, he was told the rumors were constitutionally protected speech.
Edgar Welch, a Christian who has Bible verses tattooed on his back, was one of Jones’s listeners.
On December 4, he drove 350 miles from his home in North Carolina to Comet Ping Pong, armed with an assault rifle, a revolver, and a knife.
He allowed guests and staff to leave while he searched for enslaved children supposedly hidden in tunnels.
He fired his rifle at least once, to open a locked door.
After finding no children, he surrendered to police.
Fake news – “active misinformation” that is packaged to look as if it comes from a serious news site – is a threat to democratic institutions.
There have been less absurd examples, including a fake report of a nuclear threat by Israel’s defense minister that misled his Pakistani counterpart into retweeting the report and warning Israel that Pakistan, too, is a nuclear power.
President Barack Obama acknowledged the danger to democratic freedoms when speaking to the press in Germany shortly after the US election.
Whether or not fake news cost Clinton the presidency, it plainly could cause a candidate to lose an election and upset international relations.
It is also contrary to one of the fundamental premises on which democracy rests: that voters can make informed choices between contending candidates.
The First Amendment to the US Constitution states that.
“Congress shall make no law… abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press…” By 1919, the Supreme Court’s interpretation of those words had led to the doctrine that Congress could prohibit speech only if it posed “a clear and present danger” of serious harm.
That position was further refined in what is perhaps the greatest defense of freedom of speech by an American judge: Louis Brandeis’s concurring opinion in the 1927 case of Whitney v. California.
Brandeis described freedom of speech and assembly as “functions essential to effective democracy.”
He appealed to “courageous, self-reliant men, with confidence in the power of free and fearless reasoning applied through the processes of popular government.”
On that basis, for speech to pose a clear and present danger that could justify prohibiting it, the harm the speech would cause must be so imminent that it could preclude any opportunity to discuss fully what had been said.
If, Brandeis insisted, there is “time to expose through discussion the falsehood and fallacies, to avert the evil by the processes of education, the remedy to be applied is more speech, not enforced silence.”
Today, it is difficult to have so much confidence in the power of “free and fearless reasoning,” especially if it is supposed to be “applied through the processes of popular government” – which presumably requires that it influence elections.
Similarly, Brandeis’s belief that “more speech, not enforced silence” is the remedy for “falsehood and fallacies” looks naïve, especially if applied in an election campaign.
What, though, is the alternative?
What Jones said about Clinton is surely defamation, and she could bring a civil suit against him; but that would be costly and time-consuming, most likely taking years to move through the courts.
In any case, civil defamation lawsuits are effective only against those who have the assets to pay whatever damages are awarded.
What about criminal libel?
In the United Kingdom, “defamatory libel” was for many centuries a criminal offense, but it fell into disuse and was abolished in 2010.
In the US, criminal libel is not a federal offense.
It continues to be a crime in some states, but few cases are brought.
A report in 2015 by A. Jay Wagner and Anthony L. Fargo for the International Press Institute describes many of the recent cases as “petty” and regards the civil libel law as a better recourse for “personal grievances.”
The report concludes that criminal libel has become “redundant and unnecessary.”
Recent examples of fake news suggest that Wagner and Fargo’s conclusion was premature.
To accuse, during an election campaign, a US presidential candidate of personally murdering children is not petty, and civil libel law provides no adequate remedy.
In the Internet age, is it time for the legal pendulum to swing back toward the offense of criminal libel?
Fake News and Biased News
TOKYO – Interviews are always tricky.
If an unscrupulous interviewer is looking for a particular answer or claim, they have the power to edit, manipulate, or even rewrite their subject’s words to that end.
That is why I have long taken pains to check carefully quotations attributed to me by the media.
But, when it comes to television or radio interviews, it seemed to me that such distortions would be more difficult to pull off.
I was wrong.
Not long ago, representatives from a Japanese television program associated with a liberal-leaning newspaper requested an interview with me to discuss Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s economic-reform strategy, known as “Abenomics.”
I was interviewed for about an hour, with my answers to be included in an episode centered on a panel discussion held in the studio.
The result was not what I expected.
To be sure, I wasn’t entirely shocked to find that the panelists denied the recent achievements of Abenomics and espoused the strange view that monetary policy cannot boost an economy, and yet can suddenly cause hyperinflation.
Such claims have persisted, despite the ongoing monetary-policy-driven, low-inflation recoveries in the United States, Europe, and Japan.
But the distortion of my own words was significant.
In my interview, I highlighted the successes of Abenomics.
And I argued that a strong labor market and rising business profits would be among Abenomics’ enduring legacies, even if Abe’s administration faced political challenges.
The program included just two minutes of my interview, emphasizing the part about the potential political challenges, rather than Abenomics’ great successes.
In recent years, much attention has been devoted to “fake news” – outright disinformation that spreads widely, often through social media or other online platforms.
But my recent experience highlighted another danger: biased news, in which strategic edits surreptitiously advance the views of a journalist, editor, or broadcaster.
Such reporting, which may be delivered even by traditional news organizations, can be very damaging, not least for political leaders.
Without a doubt, Abe’s political standing has been vulnerable to the effects of biased journalism.
For example, several months ago, Abe was addressing a crowd gathered in Akihabara, a district of Tokyo.
A number of attendees, in a clear attempt to sabotage his speech, booed and heckled relentlessly.
Eventually, Abe shouted, “I am not addressing a crowd shouting like you!”
The next day, his words were reported widely; the behavior of the crowd, however, was not, leaving readers with the impression that their prime minister had, completely unprompted, yelled coarsely at Japanese citizens.
Similar distortions characterized accounts of hearings in Japan’s Diet to investigate allegations, originally made by former Vice Minister of Education and Science Kihei Maekawa, that Abe rigged the decision-making process behind the opening of a new veterinary department at a university run by a close friend of his.
Not only did Abe himself deny the accusations; Tatsuo Hatta, formerly of Osaka University, and Moriyuki Kato, former Governor of Ehime Prefecture, testified that the process had been conducted fairly and lawfully.
Yet many media organizations, including two leading newspapers, Asahi and Mainichi, continued to report on the supposed scandal – leaving out the testimony of Hatta and Kato, while providing an extensive account of Maekawa’s accusations.
Such biased reporting can easily turn voters against a leader.
Fortunately for Japan, its voters have not been duped.
Abe just scored a landslide victory in the general election on October 22, easily returning his ruling coalition to power.
In the United States, by contrast, biased news stories, especially on social media, appear to be having a powerful effect on voters, and have propelled political polarization to unprecedented levels.
This is particularly true with regard to President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly attacked the media – often wrongly, to be sure – for its coverage of his administration.
Trump, who has been known to disseminate problematic news himself, is no innocent victim of media bias.
But the state of US politics today does highlight the need for voters everywhere to have access to complete and objective accounts of what is happening in their country and the world.
Only then will they be truly empowered, as a democratic system requires, to make informed choices about their collective future.
Six Features of the Disinformation Age
MENLO PARK, CALIFORNIA – Concern about the proliferation of disinformation, misinformation, and propaganda has reached the point where many governments are proposing new legislation.
But the solutions on offer reflect an inadequate understanding of the problem – and could have negative unintended consequences.
This past June, Germany’s parliament adopted a law that includes a provision for fines of up to €50 million ($59 million) on popular sites like Facebook and YouTube, if they fail to remove “obviously illegal” content, such as hate speech and incitements to violence, within 24 hours.
Singapore has announced plans to introduce similar legislation next year to tackle “fake news.”
In July, the US Congress approved sweeping sanctions against Russia, partly in response to its alleged sponsorship of disinformation campaigns aiming to influence US elections.
Dialogue between the US Congress and Facebook, Twitter, and Google has intensified in the last few weeks, as clear evidence of campaign-ad purchases by Russian entities has emerged.
Such action is vital if we are to break the vicious circle of disinformation and political polarization that undermines democracies’ ability to function.
But while these legislative interventions all target digital platforms, they often fail to account for at least six ways in which today’s disinformation and propaganda differ from yesterday’s.
First, there is the democratization of information creation and distribution.
As Rand Waltzman, formerly of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, recently noted, any individual or group can now communicate with – and thereby influence – large numbers of others online.
This has its benefits, but it also carries serious risks – beginning with the loss of journalistic standards of excellence, like those typically enforced within established media organizations.
Without traditional institutional media gatekeepers, political discourse is no longer based on a common set of facts.
The second feature of the digital information age – a direct byproduct of democratization – is information socialization.
Rather than receiving our information directly from institutional gatekeepers, who, despite often-flawed execution, were fundamentally committed to meeting editorial standards, today we acquire it via peer-to-peer sharing.
Such peer networks may elevate content based on factors like clicks or engagement among friends, rather than accuracy or importance.
Moreover, information that is filtered through networks of friends can result in an echo chamber of news that reinforces one’s own biases (though there is considerable uncertainty about how serious a problem this represents).
It also means that people who otherwise might consume news in moderation are being inundated with political polemic and debate, including extreme positions and falsehoods, which heighten the risk of misinforming or polarizing wider swaths of the public.
The third element of today’s information landscape is atomization – the divorce of individual news stories from brand or source.
Previously, readers could easily distinguish between non-credible sources, like the colorful and sensational tabloids in the checkout line at the supermarket, and credible ones, such as longstanding local or national newspapers.
Now, by contrast, an article shared by a friend or family member from The New York Times may not look all that different than one from a conspiracy theorist’s blog. And, as a recent study from the American Press Institute found, the original source of an article matters less to readers than who in their network shares the link.
The fourth element that must inform the fight against disinformation is anonymity in information creation and distribution.
Online news often lacks not only a brand, but also a byline.
This obscures potential conflicts of interest, creates plausible deniability for state actors intervening in foreign information environments, and creates fertile ground for bots to thrive.
One 2015 study found that bots generate around 50% of all web traffic, with as many as 50 million Twitter users and 137 million Facebook users exhibiting non-human behaviors.
Of course there are “good” bots, say, providing customer service or real-time weather updates.
But there are also plenty of bad actors “gaming” online information systems to promote extreme views and inaccurate information, lending them the appearance of mainstream popularity and acceptance.
Fifth, today’s information environment is characterized by personalization.
Unlike their print, radio, or even television counterparts, Internet content creators can A/B test and adapt micro-targeted messages in real-time.
“By leveraging automated emotional manipulation alongside swarms of bots, Facebook dark posts, A/B testing, and fake news networks,” according to a recent exposé, groups like Cambridge Analytica can create personalized, adaptive, and ultimately addictive propaganda.
Donald Trump’s campaign was measuring responses to 40-50,000 variants of ads every day, then tailoring and targeting their messaging accordingly.
The final element separating today’s information ecosystem from that of the past, as Stanford law professor Nate Persily has observed, is sovereignty.
Unlike television, print, and radio, social-media platforms like Facebook or Twitter are self-regulating – and are not very good at it.
Despite the US campaign-ad controversies of the last few weeks, neither platform has yet consulted leading experts, instead seeking to solve problems in-house.
It was not until mid-September that Facebook even agreed to disclose information about political campaign ads; it still refuses to offer data on other forms of disinformation.
It is this lack of data that is undermining responses to the proliferation of disinformation and propaganda, not to mention the political polarization and tribalism that they fuel.
Facebook is the chief culprit: with an average of 1.32 billion daily active users, its impact is massive, yet the company refuses to give outside researchers access to the information needed to understand the most fundamental questions at the intersection of the Internet and politics.
(Twitter does share data with researchers, but it remains an exception.)
We are living in a brave new world of disinformation.
As long as only its purveyors have the data we need to understand it, the responses we craft will remain inadequate.
And, to the extent that they are poorly targeted, they may even end up doing more harm than good.
The Protocols of Donald J. Trump
LONDON – It is an odd quirk in the history of logic that the blameless Cretans should have given their name to the famous “liar paradox.”
The Cretan Epimenides is supposed to have said: “All Cretans are liars.”
If Epimenides was lying, he was telling the truth – and thus was lying.
Something similar can be said of US President Donald Trump: Even when he’s telling the truth, many assume he is lying – and thus being true to himself.
His trolling is notorious.
For years, he claimed, with no evidence other than unnamed sources that he called “extremely credible,” that Barack Obama’s birth certificate was fraudulent.
During the Republican primary, he linked his opponent Senator Ted Cruz’s father to John F. Kennedy’s assassination.
He has promoted the quack idea that vaccines cause autism, and has masterfully deployed the suggestio falsi – for example, his insinuation that climate change is a Chinese hoax designed to cripple the American economy.
There has always been a thriving market for fake information, forgeries, hoaxes, and conspiracy theories.
“History is a distillation of rumor,” wrote Thomas Carlyle in the nineteenth century.
Sellers of fakery manufacture information for money or for political profit; there are always eager buyers among the credulous, prurient, or vindictive.
And gossip is always entertaining.
Modern history provides us with some famous examples.
The Zinoviev letter, a forgery implicating Britain’s Labour Party in Kremlin-led Communist sedition, was published by the Daily Mail four days before the United Kingdom’s general election in 1924, dashing Labour’s chances.
Perhaps the most famous such forgery was The Protocols of the Elders of Zion.
Possibly manufactured for money, The Protocols purported to be evidence of a Jewish plan for world domination.
Its key passage reads: “[…] we shall so wear down the Goyim that they will be compelled to offer us an international power that by its position will enable us without any violence gradually to absorb all the State forces of the world and to form a Super-Government.”
Circulated by the Czarist secret police in the early 1900s to justify the regime’s anti-Jewish pogroms, it became the foundation of the anti-Semitic literature of the first half of the twentieth century, with horrendous consequences.
So what is new?
The attention being paid to fake information today arises from the hugely expanded speed with which digitally manufactured information travels around the world.
In the past, one had to be able to hoodwink more or less reputable news outlets to plant fake stories.
Now misinformation can go viral through social media, like a modern Black Death.
The important question is how this will affect democracy.
Will the unprecedented ease of access to information liberate people from thought control, or will it strengthen it to such an extent that democracy simply drowns in a sea of manipulation?
Optimists and pessimists both have good arguments.
“Knowledge is power,” say the optimists.
It seems to follow that the more information made available, the more knowledgeable voters will be, and therefore the more able to hold leaders to account.
But information, the pessimists point out, is not knowledge.
Information has to be structured to become knowledge.
Institutions like schools, universities, newspapers, and political parties have been our traditional structuring devices.
But digital technology is institutionally naked.
It provides no structuring mechanism, and therefore no control on the spread of knowledge-free opinion.
Social media have undoubtedly played a part in the rise of the populist politics that thrives in such an environment.
Left-wing populists, like Jeremy Corbyn in the UK, Bernie Sanders in the US, and Jean-Luc Mélenchon in France, received a significant boost from social media’s ability to bypass traditional news outlets.
Right-wing populists, like Trump, Marine Le Pen in France, and Geert Wilders in the Netherlands, benefited in exactly the same way.
Both sides accuse long-established media outlets of “faking” news.
Perhaps the market for news will eventually find its own equilibrium between truth and falsehood.
A fraction of the population will always be willing buyers of fake news; but the majority will learn to distinguish between trustworthy and unreliable sources.
But if the spread of misinformation is thought of as a virus, there is no natural equilibrium to be had, short of catastrophe.
So it has to be checked by inoculation.
Few trust politicians, who often have a vested interest in false information, to do the job.
One answer is independent agencies along the lines of the consumer watchdog Which?
There are a number of websites now devoted to fact checking and debunking putative news stories.
One of the best known, Snopes.com, was launched in 1994 as a project to check the accuracy of urban legends.
Facebook is now attempting to flag fake news stories by noting that they have been “disputed by third-party fact checkers.”
Worthy though these attempts are, they suffer from an inherent weakness: they still place responsibility on readers to check whether a news story is true.
But we are all liable to seek information that confirms our beliefs and ignore information that challenges them.
Facts will not be checked by those whose beliefs depend on not checking them.
There are no easy answers.
Obviously, education in critical thinking, and especially in social sciences such as economics, is necessary.
But will that be sufficient to counter the massive increase in the ability to spread fake information?
Democracy depends both on the right to free speech and the right to know.
We may have no alternative but to strike a new balance between the two.
The False Narrative of Realpolitik
GENEVA – In an era of divisive social media and partisan “fake news,” the notion that “actions speak louder than words” is no longer true.
As we are rediscovering, words are both powerful and problematic, particularly in the context of geopolitics.
The recent United Nations General Assembly meeting in New York offered the latest reminder that in diplomacy, words still matter.
Much attention has been drawn to US President Donald Trump’s remark that the United States “will have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea” should the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) threaten it or its allies.
In fact, most military experts agree that a kinetic war on the Korean Peninsula would annihilate the DPRK, and quite possibly South Korea along with it.
But other parts of Trump’s UN speech, especially its passages about national interests and sovereignty, require further reflection.
Trump makes no secret of his desire to “put America first,” and he reiterated that pledge at the UN dais.
But he also urged other leaders to put their countries first, too.
“To overcome the perils of the present and to achieve the promise of the future, we must begin with the wisdom of the past,” he said.
“Our success depends on a coalition of strong and independent nations that embrace their sovereignty to promote security, prosperity, and peace for themselves and for the world.”
One could infer, and many have, that such statements signal a revival of US devotion to Realpolitik in world affairs.
As the historian John Bew observed in his 2016 history of the term, the pendulum swing was to be expected: “Our foreign policy debates follow cycles, in which policymakers declare themselves more idealistic, or more realistic.”
But Bew’s survey also reminds us that the singular pursuit of national interests – the type of worldview championed by Trump – is not Realpolitik at all if it is uncoupled from a transformative idea or normative purpose.
Severing moral concerns from global affairs would only weaken the US and all who emulate it.
The concept of Realpolitik emerged from the mixed outcomes of the European revolutions of 1848, when Germany’s future unification had many possible permutations, but the larger political goal – an international order comprising strong nation-states – was nonetheless clear.
But in the wake of Trump’s “America First” doctrine, the challenge for the world today is to discern what the purpose of political realism has become.
One answer was shared at the World Economic Forum’s (WEF) annual meeting in Davos earlier this year.
There, Chinese President Xi Jinping offered a robust defense of globalization and emphasized his view that in pursuing national agendas, countries should place objectives “in the broader context” and “refrain from pursuing their own interests at the expense of others.”
If leaders of the world’s two most powerful countries differ fundamentally in their approach to international relations, what are the prospects for strengthening cooperation globally?
History is replete with examples of conflicts stemming from a rising power challenging the influence and interests of an incumbent.
During the Peloponnesian War, according to the Greek historian Thucydides, “It was the rise of Athens and the fear that this instilled in Sparta that made war inevitable.”
How China and the US avoid what Harvard’s Graham Allison has termed the “Thucydides Trap” is of great concern to the world, as is ensuring that geostrategic disputes elsewhere don’t lead to violence.
As Stanford biologist Robert Sapolsky has argued, behavioral dichotomies that might seem inevitable and crucial one minute can, under the right circumstances, “evaporate in an instant.”
For Sapolsky, “contact theory,” which was developed in the 1950s by psychologist Gordon Allport, can foster reconciliation among rivals, and help bridge the “us-them” divide.
“Contact,” whether between kids at a summer camp or negotiators around a table, can lead to greater understanding if engagement is lengthy and on neutral territory, outcome-oriented, informal, personal, and avoids anxiety or competition.
What is said during these engagements is crucial.
As the Nobel laureate economist Robert J. Shiller has noted, stories, whether true or not, are drivers of major decisions, especially economic choices.
In his study of “narrative economics,” Shiller highlights the effects that “viral” stories can have on the global economy.
He points out that people’s choices and assessments of current events are partly based on the stories they have heard about past events.
For example, the 2007-2009 global financial crisis is called the “Great Recession” because the traumatic tales of the Great Depression persist in our collective memory.
Words and narratives affect international affairs in similar ways.
Narratives that have emerged in response to – or as a result of – national, regional, and global divisions are often structured by an “us-them” dichotomy.
But these national narratives, as appealing as they may be to some, must not be confused with Realpolitik,as they remain bereft of the innovation, inspiration, and idealism needed for transformational change.
Stories that seek to preserve the singular benefits of global integration, while limiting shared obligations, may in fact go “viral” domestically, because citizens yearn for responsive leadership that addresses local and national concerns.
But a shared identity and collective purpose remains elusive, despite the fact that we are living in an age of social networks.
That fact alone cannot absolve governments of their regional and global responsibilities.
The political, economic, and social fractures that have emerged must not foster intolerance, indecision, or inaction.
That is why next year’s WEF annual meeting will seek to rededicate leaders to the development of a shared narrative, one that strengthens cooperation for this generation and every generation to come.
The Courage to Normalize Monetary Policy
NEW HAVEN – Three cheers for central banks!
That may sound strange coming from someone who has long been critical of the world’s monetary authorities.
But I applaud the US Federal Reserve’s long-overdue commitment to the normalization of its policy rate and balance sheet. I say the same for the Bank of England, and for the European Central Bank’s grudging nod in the same direction.
The risk, however, is that these moves may be too little too late.
Central banks’ unconventional monetary policies – namely, zero interest rates and massive asset purchases – were put in place in the depths of the 2008-2009 financial crisis.
It was an emergency operation, to say the least. With their traditional policy tools all but exhausted, the authorities had to be exceptionally creative in confronting the collapse in financial markets and a looming implosion of the real economy.
Central banks, it seemed, had no choice but to opt for the massive liquidity injections known as “quantitative easing.”
This strategy did arrest the free-fall in markets.
But it did little to spur meaningful economic recovery.
The G7 economies (the United States, Japan, Canada, Germany, the United Kingdom, France, and Italy) have collectively grown at just a 1.8% average annual rate over the 2010-2017 post-crisis period.
That is far short of the 3.2% average rebound recorded over comparable eight-year intervals during the two recoveries of the 1980s and the 1990s.
Unfortunately, central bankers misread the efficacy of their post-2008 policy actions.
They acted as if the strategy that helped end the crisis could achieve the same traction in fostering a cyclical rebound in the real economy. In fact, they doubled down on the cocktail of zero policy rates and balance-sheet expansion.
According to the Bank for International Settlements, central banks’ combined asset holdings in the major advanced economies (the US, the eurozone, and Japan) expanded by $8.3 trillion over the past nine years, from $4.6 trillion in 2008 to $12.9 trillion in early 2017.
Yet this massive balance-sheet expansion has had little to show for it.
Over the same nine-year period, nominal GDP in these economies increased by just $2.1 trillion.
That implies a $6.2 trillion injection of excess liquidity – the difference between the growth in central bank assets and nominal GDP – that was not absorbed by the real economy and has, instead been sloshing around in global financial markets, distorting asset prices across the risk spectrum.
Normalization is all about a long-overdue unwinding of those distortions.
Fully ten years after the onset of the Great Financial Crisis, it seems more than appropriate to move the levers of monetary policy off their emergency settings.
A world in recovery – no matter how anemic that recovery may be – does not require a crisis-like approach to monetary policy.
Monetary authorities have only grudgingly accepted this.
Today’s generation of central bankers is almost religious in its commitment to inflation targeting – even in today’s inflationless world.
While the pendulum has swung from squeezing out excess inflation to avoiding deflation, price stability remains the sine qua non in central banking circles.
Inflation fixations are not easy to break. I can personally attest to that.
As a staff economist at the Fed in the 1970s, I witnessed first-hand the birth of the Great Inflation – and the role played by inept central banking in creating it.
For years, if not decades, after that experience, I was convinced that renewed inflation was just around the corner.
Today’s generation of central bankers has dug in its heels at the opposite end of the inflation spectrum.
Wedded to a “Phillips curve” mentality conditioned by the presumed tradeoff between economic slack and inflation, central bankers remain steadfast in their view that an accommodative policy bias is appropriate as long as inflation falls short of their targets.
This is today’s biggest risk.
Normalization should not be viewed as an inflation-dependent operation.
Below-target inflation is not an excuse for a long and drawn-out normalization.
In order to rebuild the policy arsenal for the inevitable next crisis or recession, a prompt and methodical restoration of monetary policy to pre-crisis settings is far preferable.
A failure to do this was, in fact, precisely the problem during the last pre-crisis period, in the early 2000s.
The Fed committed the most egregious error of all.
In the aftermath of the bursting of the dotcom bubble in early 2000, and with fears of a Japan scenario weighing heavily on the policy debate, it opted for an incremental normalization strategy – raising its policy rate 17 times in small moves of 25 basis points over a 24-month period from mid-2004 to mid-2006.
Yet it was precisely during that period when increasingly frothy financial markets were sowing the seeds of the disaster that was shortly to follow.
In the current period, the Fed has outlined a strategy that does not achieve balance-sheet normalization until 2022-2023 at the earliest – 2.5-3 times as long as the ill-designed campaign of the mid-2000s.
In today’s frothy markets, that’s asking for trouble.
In the interest of financial stability, there is a compelling argument for much speedier normalization – completing the task in as little as half the time the Fed is currently suggesting.
Independent central banks were not designed to win popularity contests.
Paul Volcker knew that when he led the charge against raging inflation in the early 1980s.
But the approach taken by his successors, Alan Greenspan and Ben Bernanke, was very different – allowing financial markets and an increasingly asset-dependent economy to take charge of the Fed.
For Janet Yellen – or her successor – it will take courage to forge a different path.
With more than $6 trillion of excess liquidity still sloshing around in global financial markets, that courage cannot be found soon enough.
America’s Risky Recovery
CAMBRIDGE – The United States’ economy is approaching full employment and may already be there.
But America’s favorable employment trend is accompanied by a substantial increase in financial-sector risks, owing to the excessively easy monetary policy that was used to achieve the current economic recovery.
The overall unemployment rate is down to just 5.5%, and the unemployment rate among college graduates is just 2.5%.
The increase in inflation that usually occurs when the economy reaches such employment levels has been temporarily postponed by the decline in the price of oil and by the 20% rise in the value of the dollar.
The stronger dollar not only lowers the cost of imports, but also puts downward pressure on the prices of domestic products that compete with imports.
Inflation is likely to begin rising in the year ahead.
The return to full employment reflects the Federal Reserve’s strategy of “unconventional monetary policy” – the combination of massive purchases of long-term assets known as quantitative easing and its promise to keep short-term interest rates close to zero.
The low level of all interest rates that resulted from this policy drove investors to buy equities and to increase the prices of owner-occupied homes.
As a result, the net worth of American households rose by $10 trillion in 2013, leading to increases in consumer spending and business investment.
After a very slow initial recovery, real GDP began growing at annual rates of more than 4% in the second half of 2013.
Consumer spending and business investment continued at that rate in 2014 (except for the first quarter, owing to the weather-related effects of an exceptionally harsh winter).
That strong growth raised employment and brought the economy to full employment.
But the Fed’s unconventional monetary policies have also created dangerous risks to the financial sector and the economy as a whole.
The very low interest rates that now prevail have driven investors to take excessive risks in order to achieve a higher current yield on their portfolios, often to meet return obligations set by pension and insurance contracts.
This reaching for yield has driven up the prices of all long-term bonds to unsustainable levels, narrowed credit spreads on corporate bonds and emerging-market debt, raised the relative prices of commercial real estate, and pushed up the stock market’s price-earnings ratio to more than 25% higher than its historic average.
The low-interest-rate environment has also caused lenders to take extra risks in order to sustain profits.
Banks and other lenders are extending credit to lower-quality borrowers, to borrowers with large quantities of existing debt, and as loans with fewer conditions on borrowers (so-called “covenant-lite loans”).
Moreover, low interest rates have created a new problem: liquidity mismatch.
Favorable borrowing costs have fueled an enormous increase in the issuance of corporate bonds, many of which are held in bond mutual funds or exchange-traded funds (ETFs).
These funds’ investors believe – correctly – that they have complete liquidity.
They can demand cash on a day’s notice.
But, in that case, the mutual funds and ETFs have to sell those corporate bonds.
It is not clear who the buyers will be, especially since the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial-reform legislation restricted what banks can do and increased their capital requirements, which has raised the cost of holding bonds.
Although there is talk about offsetting these risks with macroprudential policies, no such policies exist in the US, except for the increased capital requirements that have been imposed on commercial banks.
There are no policies to reduce risks in shadow banks, insurance companies, or mutual funds.
So that is the situation that the Fed now faces as it considers “normalizing” monetary policy.
Some members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC, the Fed’s policymaking body) therefore fear that raising the short-term federal funds rate will trigger a substantial rise in longer-term rates, creating losses for investors and lenders, with adverse effects on the economy.
Others fear that, even without such financial shocks, the economy’s current strong performance will not continue when interest rates are raised.
And still other FOMC members want to hold down interest rates in order to drive the unemployment rate even lower, despite the prospects of accelerating inflation and further financial-sector risks.
But, in the end, the FOMC members must recognize that they cannot postpone the increase in interest rates indefinitely, and that once they begin to raise the rates, they must get the real (inflation-adjusted) federal funds rate to 2% relatively quickly.
My own best guess is that they will start to raise rates in September, and that the federal funds rate will reach 3% by some point in 2017.
The FIFA Syndrome
LONDON – The arrest of FIFA executives on a raft of fraud and corruption charges has been front-page news in recent days.
But the charges brought by the Swiss and American authorities focus on bribery and embezzlement, and do not address another egregious injustice: the treatment of the migrant workers in Qatar who are building the stadiums for the 2022 FIFA Football World Cup.
Amnesty International recently released a report on the abysmal conditions in Qatar.
The workers are subject to unsafe construction sites, exploitative recruitment agencies, and little recourse to formal justice.
Recently, Nepal’s labor minister publicly spoke out about the government of Qatar not allowing his country’s migrant workers to return home to mourn relatives who died in the April 2015 earthquake.
As Amnesty International notes, the responsibility lies primarily with the Qatari authorities.
But FIFA had – and still has – a responsibility to act.
There have also been calls for sponsors, including McDonalds, Visa, Coca-Cola, Adidas, Budweiser, Gazprom, KIA, and Hyundai, to place pressure on FIFA and Qatar to improve working conditions.
Such issues have arisen in recent years in other sectors as well.
In April, Human Rights Watch issued a report on the treatment of garment workers in Bangladesh.
The report, prompted by the 2013 Rana Plaza collapse, in which more than 1,100 people died and over 2,000 were injured, highlighted poor working conditions, inadequate building inspections, weak labor laws, and the need for fairer wage practices and legal benefits.
Beyond these examples, there have been many others.
In technology, Apple and Foxconn have faced criticism for working conditions at their Chinese production sites.
Even educational institutions, such as New York University’s new campus in Abu Dhabi, have been tainted by episodes of workplace exploitation and abuse.
These are not isolated cases.
For every disaster and high-profile case that hits the headlines, there are many more that we never hear about.
Nonetheless, one hopes that the treatment of those who make the goods, produce the services, and build the things that make us happy and productive – from clothing and technology to sports stadiums and college campuses – continues to come under scrutiny.
Globalization should force managers – and all of us – to do some serious thinking about labor practices around the world.
Here is where it gets complicated.
What counts as a company’s workforce?
Are “its” workers only those people on its own payroll?
Are companies responsible for their products’ entire supply chains?
To what extent can – and should – a company be held to account for the choices of those who may be several links removed?
When a serious issue has been brought to a company’s attention, are its managers obliged to address it, even if it involves the subcontractor of a subcontractor?
The larger and more complex the company, the harder it is to track all of the firms with which it does business, the firms that they then subcontract to, and so on.
Companies, not surprisingly, say that their responsibility extends only so far.
But that is not an answer; it is a choice.
Organizations can decide to extend their reach.
They can even decide that they want to know the full provenance of all materials and components in their products, and that they will hold their extended suppliers to account.
In this sense, the larger the company, the greater its responsibility.
But larger companies also have a larger ability to become a force for good, both locally and globally.
If a company the size of US retailer Walmart decides that it will not allow wasteful packaging, its purchasing power will lead to changes in packaging for the entire retail sector.
The same is true of wages and labor practices.
When the world’s biggest companies and most well recognized brands take seriously their responsibility as buyers, sellers, and manufacturers and make a firm commitment to act on core values, others tend to follow – or risk being left behind.
Those that operate in an ethical manner and seek to improve the lives of all who are associated with the manufacture, marketing, and distribution of their products will benefit from kudos, more business, or simply not being singled out as a bad actor.
By contrast, companies whose managers believe that a competitive marketplace is no place for ethical behavior will suffer if and when consumers take their business elsewhere; government regulation and fines force them to act; or they become unable to attract an educated and ever-more discerning workforce.
All of it – the constant scrutiny, the bad press, the tarnished reputation – will hit their long-term stock prices.
Much the same is true for organizations like FIFA.
When sponsors like Coca-Cola or Adidas believe that their reputations will be tarnished by association with an organization engaged in corrupt practices, they will take their brand-management dollars elsewhere.
Companies are made up of people.
Paying fair wages, adopting ethical sourcing practices, and upholding the dignity of workers should be a part of the way they calculate their success.
Those who disconnect themselves from the fate of others, who act without conscience or a sense of right and wrong, and who spurn ordinary human decency have no place running organizations or sitting on company boards.
The things that make us happy must not come at an unforgivably high price.
Finishing the Post-Crisis Job
LONDON – August 9, 2017, is the tenth anniversary of the decision by the French bank BNP Paribas to freeze some $2.2 billion worth of money-market funds.
Those of us who were active in financial markets at the time remember that event as the beginning of the worst global financial crisis since the Great Depression.
Many economists and financial observers argue that we are still living with the consequences of that crisis, and with the forces that incited it.
This is partly true.
Many developed economies still have in place unconventional monetary policies such as quantitative easing, and both productivity and real (inflation-adjusted) wage growth appear to be mostly stagnant.
But it is important to put these developments in perspective.
Many people, including the Queen of England in November 2008, still ask: “Why did no one see it coming?”
In fact, many financial observers did warn that housing prices in the United States were rising untenably, especially given the lack of domestic personal savings among US consumers.
As Chief Economist of Goldman Sachs at the time, I had written three different papers over a number of years showing that the US current-account deficit was unsustainable.
Unfortunately, these findings largely fell on deaf ears, and the firm’s foreign-exchange salespeople probably got bored passing on yet more of the same pieces to their clients.
At one point in 2007, the US current-account deficit was reported to be 6-7% of GDP (it has since been revised down to around 5% for the full year).
This high figure reflected the fact that the US trade balance had been steadily deteriorating since the 1990s.
In the absence of any obvious negative consequences, however, complacency had set in, and the US continued to spend more than it saved.
Meanwhile, China had spent the 1990s exporting low-value-added products to the rest of the world, not least to US consumers.
In 2007, its current-account surplus was around 10% of GDP – the mirror image of the US.
Whereas the latter was saving too little, China was saving too much.
For some observers, this huge international imbalance was the source of the crisis.
In the years leading up to the crash, they argued that the global financial system was simply doing its job, by finding increasingly clever ways to recycle the surpluses.
Of course, we now know that it performed that job rather poorly.
Much has changed in the intervening decade.
In 2017, China will run a current-account surplus of 1.5-2% of GDP, and the US will most likely run a deficit of around 2% – but possibly as high as 3% – of GDP.
This is a vast improvement for the world’s two largest economies.
Still, other countries have built up ever-larger current-account imbalances over the past decade.
Chief among them is Germany, whose external surplus now exceeds 8% of GDP.
Germany’s current account suggests that there are deep imbalances that could lead to a new crisis if policymaking is not well coordinated.
The last thing that Europe needs is another sudden reversal, as we saw at the height of the Greek debt crisis.
The United Kingdom, for its part, will have a current-account deficit above 3% of GDP this year, which is nearly three times what it was ten years ago.
But that is not to say that the UK’s trade balance has significantly deteriorated.
Rather, it reflects the fact that the UK is a major financial center, and that investment returns have shifted more in the UK than elsewhere.
All told, the global economy today is much healthier than it was ten years ago.
Many are disappointed that real global GDP growth since the crisis has undershot performance in the previous decade.
But since 2009 – the worst year of the recession – the global economy has grown at an average rate of 3.3%, just as it did in the 1980s and 1990s.
Of course, this is largely owing to China, the only BRIC country (Brazil, Russia, India, and China) that has met my growth expectations for the decade (although India is not too far behind).
The size of China’s economy has more than trebled in nominal terms since 2007, with GDP rising from $3.5 trillion to around $12 trillion.
As a result, the aggregate size of the BRIC economies is now around $18 trillion, which is larger than the European Union and almost as big as the US.
There will inevitably be another financial bubble, so it is worth asking where it might occur.
In my view, it is unlikely to emerge directly from the banking sector, which is now heavily regulated.
The bigger concern is that many leading companies across different industries have continued to focus excessively on quarterly profits, because that determines how executives are remunerated.
Policymakers should take a hard look at the role of share buybacks in this process.
To her credit, in the Conservative Party’s 2017 election manifesto, British Prime Minister Theresa May announced that her government would do this.
One hopes that May’s government follows through.
Doing so could strike a symbolic blow against the underlying malaise of post-crisis economic life.
The West needs real investments and higher productivity and wage growth – not more economically unjustifiable profits.
Banking on the Unbanked
TORONTO – In a sea of gloomy news, one bright headline appears on the horizon.
The World Bank’s latest figures on individuals’ bank accounts, to be released next spring, are expected to show that the number of people holding accounts at banks or other formal financial institutions has grown.
The last time the World Bank published its Global Findex report, in April 2015, an estimated 700 million adults, mainly in developing countries, had obtained access to financial services during the previous three years.
That amounted to an increase of more than 21% in the global number of “banked” individuals.
Because broader access to financial services helps to create a path out of poverty, any increase in this metric is a positive sign for human development.
But my organization won’t be declaring victory when the new report comes out.
No matter what the World Bank data show, universal financial inclusion for the world’s poorest remains a distant goal.
At the moment, some two billion adults remain excluded from formal financial services.
Excessive documentation requirements, high account fees, limited access to bank branches, and the perception that financial institutions are “only for the rich” are among the most persistent obstacles to overcome.
At the Mastercard Foundation, we are committed to helping to remove these barriers for the world’s poorest.
This month in Accra, Ghana, we convened the fifth annual Symposium on Financial Inclusion, bringing together hundreds of financial services providers, policymakers, academics, and development experts to examine how to broaden and deepen financial inclusion.
We have been hosting this global conference since 2013, and each year, a familiar concern emerges: financial institutions could do more to focus on the needs of their poorest clients.
Because banks often do not consider the behaviors and aspirations of poor customers, they do not always offer the products and services the poor need.
If the industry’s priorities changed, barriers to inclusion would fall.
Reversing this trend should be easier than it is.
After all, when people prosper, so do banks.
Poor people tend to save more money when they can access bank accounts or make mobile payments.
With savings comes increased overall prosperity.
Children do better in school when parents can easily pay fees.
Women become more empowered to start businesses.
Poor households can better cope with adverse shocks like crop failure, illness, or natural disaster.
The positive economic knock-on effects are obvious.
With bank accounts, budding entrepreneurs can establish their creditworthiness and tap responsible, formal lenders.
And with capital, small enterprises can grow into larger businesses, employing others, especially young people.
Technology has helped close the gap in recent years.
The success of digital payment platforms, such as the M-Pesa mobile app in Kenya, demonstrates how quickly vulnerable clients will take up and use inexpensive products and services if they are designed with users’ needs in mind.
Moreover, financial technology firms in Africa and Asia are finding innovative ways to analyze data generated by poor people’s activities, and using that data to design and deliver better banking services.
Non-traditional approaches are also emerging, such as reaching the unbanked poor via small, independent businesses that they already use and trust.
But much of the onus for inclusion will remain on financial institutions.
One argument I often hear is that the financial services sector is risk-averse.
Given banks’ fiduciary obligations to their customers, this is not an entirely bad trait.
Yet banks and other financial institutions should realize that risk protection is perfectly compatible with service to poor customers.
By ignoring poor people’s needs, financial institutions are overlooking a massive potential market.
To reach hundreds of millions of new clients, the world’s financial institutions need only walk a metaphorical mile in the shoes of a poor person. They would then see that no one should be excluded because of inaccurate, outdated, or unfair assumptions.
Today, more people than ever are benefiting from access to modern and responsible financial services.
No doubt, next year’s World Bank data will indicate even greater gains.
But to achieve a world where no one is excluded, the industry must place the needs of poor clients at the center of its business strategies.
Only then will the good news about financial inclusion become great.
Why Financial Markets Underestimate Risk
CAMBRIDGE – During most of 2017, the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index (VIX) has been at the lowest levels of the last decade.
Recently, the VIX dipped below nine, even lower than in March 2007, just before the subprime mortgage crisis nearly blew up the global financial system.
Investors, it seems, are once again failing to appreciate just how risky the world is.
Known colloquially as the “fear index,” the VIX measures financial markets’ sensitivity to uncertainty – that is, the perceived probability of large fluctuations in the stock market’s value – as conveyed by stock index option prices.
A low VIX signals a “risk-on” period, when investors “reach for yield,” exchanging US Treasury bills and other safe-haven securities for riskier assets like stocks, corporate bonds, real estate, and carry-trade currencies.
This is where we are today, despite the variety of actual risks facing the economy.
While each of those risks will probably remain low in a given month, the unusually large number of them implies a reasonably strong chance that at least one will materialize over the next few years.
The first major risk is the bursting of a stock-market bubble.
Major stock-market indices hit record highs in September, in the United States and elsewhere, and equity prices are high relative to benchmarks like earnings and dividends.
Robert Shiller’s cyclically adjusted price-earnings ratio is now above 30 – a level previously reached only twice, at the peaks of 1929 and 2000, both of which were followed by stock-market crashes.
We also face the risk of a bursting bond-market bubble.
Former US Federal Reserve Board Chair Alan Greenspan recently suggested that the bond market is even more overvalued (or “irrationally exuberant”) than the stock market.
The market is accustomed to falling bond yields: both corporate and government bonds were on a downward trend from 1981 to 2016.
But interest rates can’t go much lower than they are today; in fact, they are expected to rise, particularly in the US, though the European Central Bank and other major central banks also appear to be entering a tightening cycle.
If, say, an increase in inflation generates expectations that the Fed will raise interest rates more aggressively, a stock- or bond-market crash might result.
Geopolitical risk is also high – indeed, it has rarely been higher than it is today, just as faith in the stabilizing influence of US global leadership has rarely been lower.
The most acute risk relates to North Korea’s advancing nuclear program, but there are also substantial risks in the Middle East and elsewhere.
These risks are being exacerbated by US President Donald Trump, who has made a number of foreign-policy missteps, from mishandling the North Korea crisis to threatening to abrogate the Iran nuclear agreement.
So far, the consequences of Trump’s wild rhetoric on the domestic front have been limited, because most of it has not been translated into legislation.
But on the international front, it could have disastrous implications.
Beyond Trump’s capriciousness is a broader crisis in US politics.
Though showdowns in the US Congress over the debt ceiling did not result in a government shutdown this month, US leaders have only kicked the can down the road to the end of the year, when the stakes could well be higher and the stalemate more intractable.
The US may even face a constitutional crisis, if Special Counsel Robert Mueller were to find, for example, evidence of illegal contact between the Trump campaign and the Russian government.
The last time the VIX was as low as it is today, in 2006 and early 2007, one could also draw up a lengthy list of potential crises.
Most obvious, housing prices in the United Kingdom and the US were at record highs relative to benchmarks like rent, raising the risk of a collapse.
Yet markets acted as if risk was low, driving down the VIX and US Treasury bill rates, and driving up prices of stocks, junk bonds, and emerging-market securities.
When the housing market did crash, it was regarded as a surprise.
The crash lay outside any standard probability distribution that could have been estimated from past data, analysts declared, and was therefore a black swan event, or a case of “Knightian uncertainty,” radical uncertainty, or unknown unknowns.
After all, the analysts argued, housing prices had never fallen in nominal terms before.
But, while nominal housing prices had not fallen in the US in the previous 70 years, they had fallen in Japan in the 1990s and in the US in the 1930s.
This was, therefore, not a case of Knightian uncertainty, but of classical uncertainty, in which the data set generating the probability distribution was unnecessarily limited to a few decades of domestic observations.
In this sense, it is the “black swan” term that fits best – indeed, better than those who use it realize.
Nineteenth-century British philosophers cited black swans as the quintessential example of a phenomenon whose occurrence could not be inferred from observed data.
But that, too, reflected a failure to consider data from enough countries or centuries.
(The black swan is an Australian species that had been identified by ornithologists in the eighteenth century.)
This type of failure to take a sufficiently broad view turns out to be a key reason why investors periodically underestimate risk.
The formulas for pricing options, for example, require a statistical estimate of the variance.
Likewise, the formula for pricing mortgage-backed securities requires a statistical estimate of the frequency distribution of defaults.
Analysts estimate these parameters by plugging in just the last few years of data for the given country.
Moreover, in the boom-bust cycle described by Hyman Minsky, a period of low volatility lulls investors into a false sense of security, leading them to become over-leveraged and ultimately producing a crash.
Perhaps investors will re-evaluate the risks affecting the economy today, and the VIX will adjust.
But, if history is any guide, this will not happen until the negative shock, whatever it is, actually hits.
Fighting the Next Global Financial Crisis
NEW HAVEN – What do people mean when they criticize generals for “fighting the last war”?
It’s not that generals ever think they will face the same weapon systems and the same battlefields.
They certainly know better.
The error, to the extent that the generals make it, must operate at a more subtle level.
Generals are sometimes slow to get around to developing plans and ordnance for those new weapon systems and battlefields.
And, just as important, they sometimes assume that the public psychology and narratives that influence their soldiers' morale are the same as in the last war.
That is also true for regulators whose job is to prevent financial crises.
For the same reasons, they may be slow to change in response to new situations.
They tend to adapt only gradually to changing public psychology.
The need for regulation depends on public perceptions of the last crisis, and, as George Akerlof and I argued in Animal Spirits, these perceptions depend heavily on changing popular narratives.
The latest progress reports from the Financial Stability Board (FSB) in Basel outline definite improvements in stability-enhancing financial regulations in 24 of the world’s largest economies.
Their “Dashboard” tabulates progress in 14 different regulatory areas.
For example, the FSB gives high marks for all 24 countries in implementing the Basel III risk-based capital requirements.
But the situation is not altogether reassuring.
These risk-based capital requirements may not be high enough, as Anat Admati and Martin Hellwig argued in their influential book The Bankers New Clothes.
And there has been much less progress in a dozen other regulatory areas that the FSB tabulates.
Consider, for example, regulations regarding money market funds, which, according to the FSB, only a few countries have developed since 2008.
Money market funds are an alternative to banks for storing one’s money, offering somewhat higher interest rates, but without the insurance that protects bank deposits in many countries.
As with bank deposits, investors can take their money out at any time.
And, like bank deposits, the funds are potentially subject to a run if a large number of people try to withdraw their money at the same time.
On September 16, 2008, a few days after the run on the US bank Washington Mutual began and the day after the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy was announced, a major United States money market fund, Reserve Primary Fund, which had invested in Lehman debt, was in serious trouble.
With assets totaling less than it owed to investors, the fund seemed to be on the verge of a run.
As panic rose among the public, the federal government, fearing a major run on other money market funds, guaranteed all such funds for one year, starting September 19, 2008.
The reason why this run was so alarming as to require unprecedented government support stems from the narratives underlying it.
In fact, the Reserve Primary Fund did not lose everything.
It merely “broke the buck,” meaning that it couldn’t pay one dollar for a dollar on the books; but it could still pay $0.97.
So why a crisis?
After all, bank depositors regularly lose more when unexpected inflation erodes their savings’ real purchasing power (only the nominal value of those deposits is insured).
But the narratives don’t focus on that.
The loss of real value due to inflation hasn’t been a prominent theme of the public narrative in the US for decades, because sustained price stability has caused people to forget about it.
But they hadn’t forgotten about the Great Depression of the 1930s, even though most people alive today weren’t alive then.
In 2008, the Great Depression narrative was being recycled everywhere, with all its colorful stories of financial panic and angry crowds forming around closed banks.
Moreover, trusted authorities had seemed to say again and again that such events were historically remote and could not happen again.
In the 2008 angry zeitgeist, the public reaction to a relatively minor event took on stunning proportions.
It took almost six years after the crisis for the US Securities and Exchange Commission to reduce money market funds’ vulnerability, by requiring in 2014 a “floating NAV” (net asset value), which means that prime money market funds no longer promise to pay out a dollar for a dollar’s nominal value.
They will pay out whatever the depositor’s share in the accounts is.
This does not insure the funds’ investors against losses.
Yet this plausibly will help prevent runs because it means sudden withdrawals by some won’t damage the accounts of others who did not withdraw.
The international regulatory framework has changed for the better since 2008, but no such changes can anticipate all the kinds of change in narratives that underlie public animal spirits.
Regulators could have imposed a floating NAV decades ago; they didn’t because they didn’t foresee a narrative that would make money market funds unstable.
Regulatory authorities could not have been expected to predict the sudden public attention to the newly discovered risk of runs on nonbank financial companies.
As long as we have an economic system that produces growth by rewarding inspired actors and investors, we will face the risk that adverse talk and stories can suddenly and temporarily overwhelm the inspiration.
Regulators must counter the risks implied by structures that are intrinsically destabilizing, as the money market funds were.
But the most urgent regulations will always be time- and context-specific, because narratives change.
And how these narratives resonate with the public may once again reveal chinks in our financial armor.
The Promise of Fiscal Money
ATHENS – Western capitalism has few sacred cows left.
It is time to question one of them: the independence of central banks from elected governments.
The rationale for entrusting monetary policy fully to central banks is well understood: politicians, overly tempted during the electoral cycle to create more money, pose a threat to economic stability.
While progressives have always protested that central banks can never be truly independent, because their autonomy from elected officials increases their dependence on the financiers they are meant to keep in check, the argument in favor of removing monetary policy from democratic politics has prevailed since the 1970s.
Setting aside the political controversy, central bank independence is predicated on an economic axiom: that money and debt (or credit) are strictly separable.
Debt – for example, a government or corporate bond that is bought and sold for a price that is a function of inflation and default risk – can be traded domestically.
Money, on the other hand, cannot default and is a means, rather than an object, of exchange (the currency market notwithstanding).
But this axiom no longer holds.
With the rise of financialization, commercial banks have become increasingly reliant on one another for short-term loans, mostly backed by government bonds, to finance their daily operations.
This liquidity acquires familiar properties: used as a means of exchange and as a store of value, it becomes a form of money.
And there’s the rub: as banks issue more inter-bank money, the financial system requires more government bonds to back the increase.
The growing inter-bank money supply fuels demand for government debt, in a never-ending cycle that generates tides of liquidity over which central banks have little control.
In this brave new financial world, central banks’ independence is becoming meaningless, because the money they create represents a shrinking share of the total money supply.
With the rise of inter-bank money, backed mostly by government debt, fiscal policy has become an essential factor in determining the quantity of actual money lubricating modern capitalism.
Indeed, the more independent a central bank is, the greater the role of fiscal policy in determining the quantity of money in an economy.
For example, in the eurozone, Germany’s tight fiscal policy is creating a shortage of bunds (German government bonds), which is limiting both the European Central Bank’s capacity to implement its quantitative easing policy and commercial banks’ ability to produce more inter-bank money.
Money and government debt are now so intertwined that the analytical basis for central bank autonomy has disappeared.
Of course, any attempt to bring treasuries and central banks back under one roof would expose politicians to accusations of trying to get their grubby hands on the levers of monetary policy.
But another response to the new reality is available: Leave central banks alone, but give governments a greater say in domestic money creation – and, indeed, greater independence from the central bank – by establishing a parallel payments system based on fiscal money or, more precisely, money backed by future taxes.
How would fiscal money work?
For starters, it would “live” on the tax authority’s digital platform, using the existing tax file numbers of individuals and companies.
Anyone with a tax file number (TFN) in some country receives a free account linked to their TFN.
Individuals and firms will then be able to add credit to their TFN-linked account by transferring money from their normal bank account, in the same way that they do today to pay their taxes.
And they will do so well in advance of tax payments because the state guarantees to extinguish in, say, a year €1,080 ($1,289) of the tax owed for every €1,000 transferred today – an effective annual interest rate of 8% payable to those willing to pay their taxes a year early.
In practice, once, say, €1,000 has been transferred to one’s TFN-linked account, a personal identification number (the familiar PIN) is issued, which can be used either to transfer the €1,000 credit to someone else’s TFN-linked account or to pay taxes in the future.
These time-stamped future tax euros, or fiscal euros, can be held for a year until maturity or be used to make payments to other taxpayers.
Smartphone apps and even government-issued cards (doubling as, say, social security ID) will make the transactions easy, fast, and virtually indistinguishable from other transactions involving central bank money.
In this closed payments system, as fiscal money approaches maturity, taxpayers not in possession of that vintage will fuel rising demand for it.
To ensure the system’s viability, the Treasury would control the total supply of fiscal money, using the effective interest rate to guarantee that the nominal value of the total supply never exceeds a percentage of national income, or of aggregate taxes, agreed by the legislature.
To ensure full transparency, and thus trust, a blockchain algorithm, designed and supervised by an independent national authority, could settle transactions in fiscal money.
The advantages of fiscal money are legion.
It would provide a source of liquidity for governments, bypassing the bond markets.
It would limit the extent to which government borrowing fuels inter-bank money creation, or at least force financiers to tie up some of their inter-bank money in the closed, domestic fiscal money system, thereby minimizing shocks from sudden capital flight.
And, by competing with the banks’ payment system, it would reduce the cost of fees customers currently pay.
Indeed, owing to the blockchain technology, fiscal money constitutes a fully transparent, transaction-cost-free, public payment system monitored jointly by every citizen (and non-citizen) who participates in it.
Fiscal money is politically attractive as well.
Governments could use any slack in money supply to top up the FTN-linked accounts of families in need, or to pay for public works, making it appealing to progressives.
And conservatives should be encouraged by a system that promises significant tax relief for those who help the government create fiscal money, without impinging on the central bank’s role in setting interest rates.
The potential transnational advantages of fiscal money are also significant.
For example, fiscal money would have helped Greece resist our creditors’ encroachments in 2015, and it was at the heart of my plan for dealing with a predatory bank holiday enforced by the ECB at the end of that June.
Today, it would give Italy, France, and other eurozone members much needed fiscal space, and possibly provide a foundation for a revamped eurozone with interlocking domestic fiscal euros, rather than parallel currencies, playing a stabilizing macroeconomic role.
And then, perhaps, it could become the basis for a New Bretton Woods, functioning like an overarching clearing union of many different fiscal money systems.
Fixing Fixed-Investment Incentives
LONDON – Back in February, I noted that the global economy at the end of 2016 was in a stronger cyclical position than most people had expected, given the political upheavals of the previous 12 months.
That upward momentum carried through to the first quarter of 2017.
According to the latest “nowcast”-type indicators, world GDP growth is exceeding 4% – perhaps the strongest performance seen since before the 2008 financial crisis.
Still, some observers – and not just chronic pessimists – have countered that the evidence remains anecdotal, and that it is impossible to predict how long the current economic moment will last.
Indeed, there have been other periods in the long post-2008 recovery when growth returned, only to peter out quickly and become sluggish again.
To bolster long-term economic growth, business investment will have to increase.
Unfortunately, this is easier said than done.
In Western economies in particular, non-residential fixed investment is precisely the factor that was missing in previous, short-lived cycles of acceleration.
No one can say for sure why non-residential business investment has failed to recover in recent years.
But I suspect that the slightly pessimistic conventional wisdom on this question is wrong.
The conventional argument asserts that wary CEOs have come to see long-term risks as “just not worth it.”
The many uncertainties they face include concerns about excessive regulation, burdensome corporate taxation, high debt levels, erratic policymaking, the political backlash against globalization, and doubts that consumer spending outside (or even within) the United States will last.
A less pessimistic view holds that, after 2008, it became inevitable that the global economy would unhitch itself from the US consumer engine and adjust to the rise of emerging consumer economies, not least China.
When that happens, we can all live happily ever after.
I tend to side with this less pessimistic crowd.
As I pointed out in March, China’s economy did surprisingly well in the first quarter of 2017, and that seems to be the case in the second quarter as well.
In fact, China’s latest monthly data show signs of economic acceleration, especially in consumption.
And it was evident in the first-quarter data that Chinese consumers are becoming an increasingly important driver of economic growth.
When confronted with the numbers, pessimists respond by insisting that China’s recent strong economic performance is only temporary – a product of yet more unsustainable stimulus.
And even if growth does last, they argue, the Chinese authorities will not allow Western businesses – or even Chinese businesses, according to ultra-pessimists – to benefit from it.
But whether or not the pessimists turn out to be right about China, it is odd that business investment remains tepid even during times when the engine of global growth is located elsewhere, such as in the US or Europe (Germany in particular).
During my time as the head of the British government’s Review on Antimicrobial Resistance, I had to develop a better understanding of the pharmaceutical industry, and I learned that there is something to be said for microeconomic forces – and for basic common sense.
Consider the future, which always has been uncertain and always will be.
And yet the biggest economic busts have happened when businesses were not uncertain enough – when they were sure that the future would be rosy.
An overabundance of certainty might explain the 2000-2001 dot-com bubble, and many others.
But if, thanks to the increased availability of so much information (including different viewpoints and opinions), we now know that the future is always uncertain, the behavior of Western businesses (and many in the emerging world) is eminently logical, especially given the current workings of the financial system.
Why would business leaders invest in an uncertain world, rather than paying dividends to demanding (but generally risk-averse) investors, or buying back some of their companies’ own shares (thereby improving the price/earnings ratio and, better yet, increasing their own remuneration)?
At the end of the day, the CEOs and the most aggressive investors are all happy with this approach.
Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for the company’s employees, past and present, who reap no benefits in their paychecks or pensions (which are actually being eroded by the low yields on government bonds across Western countries).
It is past time for our elected governments to change the rules of the game.
For starters, that means updating the tax code to make debt issuance far less attractive, especially when the proceeds are being used to buy back shares.
At a minimum, it should be harder to buy back shares than to issue true dividend payments.
That way, at least all shareholders, not just senior-executive insiders, will benefit.
Furthermore, those same executives should not be remunerated on the basis of short-term price-to-equity targets.
More investors should be demanding that the incentives change to reflect true measures of long-term performance.
To its credit, the Norwegian Sovereign Wealth Fund recently spoke out in favor of such changes.
Other large institutional investors and policymakers should follow suit, to give the corporate world a nudge.
If we change the incentives, we just might finally see business investment make a comeback.
The Elusive Benefits of Flexible Exchange Rates
CAMBRIDGE – In 1953, Milton Friedman published an essay called “The Case for Flexible Exchange Rates,” arguing that they cushion an economy from internal and external shocks by bringing about just the right price changes required to keep the economy at full employment.
But after almost half-a-century of floating exchange rates, the reality is more complicated than that.
To understand Friedman’s logic, consider a scenario in which productivity in the United States rises.
In an efficient system, this should reduce the price of US goods relative to those of the rest of the world, with US exports becoming cheaper than imports.
As America’s terms of trade (the ratio of export prices to import prices) deteriorate, demand is shifted toward US goods, keeping the economy at full employment.
If prices are “sticky” (in the producer’s currency), however, a potential hitch emerges.
Say the prices of US imports from Japan are sticky in Japanese yen and the prices of US exports to Japan are sticky in dollars.
The terms of trade will thus remain unchanged, as long as the exchange rate does as well.
Here is where a floating exchange rate comes in.
By enabling monetary expansion, and thus causing the US dollar to depreciate, the logic goes, a floating exchange rate allows the prices of US exports to decline relative to its imports.
The result is the desired deterioration of the producer’s terms of trade and the maintenance of full employment.
But this line of reasoning assumes that a country’s terms of trade move in lockstep with its exchange rate.
And that, as history over a quarter-century has shown, does not seem to be the case.
In a recent paper, the International Monetary Fund’s Emine Boz, Princeton’s Mikkel Plagborg-Møller, and I construct bilateral export- and import-price indices for 2,500 country pairs, covering 91% of world trade for the period 1989-2015.
We exclude the prices of commodities (oil, copper, and other such goods that are traded on an exchange), as these prices are not sticky.
As it turns out, there is no evidence that the terms of trade and the exchange rate move in tandem.
On the contrary, a 1% depreciation in the bilateral exchange rate is associated with only a 0.1% depreciation in the bilateral terms of trade in the year of the depreciation.
The origin of this disconnect – which Camila Casas, Federico Diez, Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, and I describe in a 2016 paper – seems to be that, for the vast majority of internationally traded goods, prices are sticky in dollars, not in the producer’s currency, as Friedman’s reasoning required.
Consider the case of the US and Japan.
Almost 100% of US exports to Japan are priced in dollars, meaning that they, as in Friedman’s version, are sticky in dollars.
But 80% of US imports from Japan are invoiced in dollars, meaning that those prices, too, are sticky in dollars, rather than in Japanese yen.
As a result, the terms of trade change very little, even if the exchange rate fluctuates.
This means that, even if the US dollar depreciates, it does not become more expensive for US importers to buy Japanese goods, so there is limited incentive to switch from Japanese to US goods. A weaker dollar thus has limited impact on US imports.
Likewise, a weaker yen does little to spur Japanese exports to the US, because the dollar price of those exports remains roughly constant.
This phenomenon applies even to trade transactions that do not include the US.
As I documented in a 2015 paper, the share of world imports invoiced in US dollars is 4.7 times larger than the share of world imports involving the US.
For world exports, that figure is 3.1.
This “dominant currency paradigm” lies at the root of the terms-of-trade disconnect.
In fact, we document that global trade prices and volumes are driven by the dollar exchange rate, rather than the exchange rate between the two trading partners’ currencies.
So fluctuations in the price and quantity of India’s imports from China, for example, depend on the rupee-dollar exchange rate, rather than the rupee-renminbi exchange rate.
The strength of the US dollar is thus a key predictor of aggregate trade volume and consumer/producer price inflation worldwide.
Friedman was right about one thing: flexible exchange rates do provide valuable monetary-policy independence.
But, in a dollar-dominated trade environment, their ability to support full employment is severely limited.
From Economic Analysis to Inclusive Growth
WASHINGTON, DC – Most economies are seeking a recipe for inclusive economic growth, whereby high rates of investment, rapid innovation, and strong GDP gains are pursued alongside measures to reduce income inequality.
Conservatives insist that growth requires low taxes and incentives such as flexible labor markets to encourage entrepreneurship.
But reducing inequality requires higher levels of government spending and taxation (except when government is pursuing deficit spending to stimulate a depressed economy).
The Scandinavian economic model is often invoked to bridge this gap.
The Danish “flexicurity” system, in particular, has historically delivered solid economic performance alongside low inequality.
Leading economists such as Philippe Aghion have published excellent analyses of how this model could balance growth, equality, and overall satisfaction of citizens elsewhere in the world.
These economists argue that labor markets with few restrictions on hiring and firing, low taxes on entrepreneurship, and generous incentives for innovation are compatible with a relatively equal income distribution, high social spending by government, and equalizing social policies such as universal free education.
This model has sustained an ongoing debate in Europe, one that is now relevant in the United States, because Donald Trump’s new administration has promised to help globalization’s “losers” while improving innovation and growth.
But in the US, it is far more difficult, politically, to argue for generous public spending on education, health care, and financial security for retirees, because doing so always raises the specter of high taxes.
An inclusive growth model would seem to have to square the policy circle.
It would have to increase substantially public spending, particularly on education, unemployment benefits and training, and health.
It is useful to look at the numbers from the oft-cited Danish and Swedish examples.
Generally speaking, these countries have excellent economic indicators.
Although GDP growth is not higher than in the US, most people share a high standard of living, and surveys show that Scandinavians (particularly Danes) are some of the happiest people in the world.
But, as the following chart shows, these countries also have some of the highest government spending- and taxation-to-GDP ratios in the OECD.
Hypothetically, if the US adopted Denmark’s universal free education policy, but kept its tax-to-GDP ratio unchanged, its fiscal deficit would exceed 6% of GDP.
The US has run deficits that high only during World War II and the Great Recession of 2008-2009, when a huge stimulus package was implemented to spur recovery.
So, just providing universal free education in the US would run the country’s deficit up to the highest level ever recorded in normal times.
In the context of this comparison, it would seem that the circle cannot be squared without a major macroeconomic shift.
Scandinavian countries are smaller and can more efficiently collect revenues and administer public services.
But even if the US approached this efficiency – a difficult feat in such a large and diverse country – social solidarity still would demand high effective taxes, as it does in Denmark and Sweden.
Another crucial component of the Scandinavian model is labor-market flexibility.
On the OECD “Employment Protection Legislation” index, the US scores a 1.2 on a 0-5 scale, where zero indicates full flexibility.
Meanwhile, France and Germany come in at 2.8, Italy at 2.9, and Denmark and Sweden at 2.3 and 2.5, respectively.
This shows that, though Scandinavian labor markets are more flexible than elsewhere in continental Europe, the US labor market is far more flexible – and provides less security – than any of them.
Such broad static accounting suggests that we should proceed cautiously in applying lessons from the Scandinavian model to large countries like the US.
Then again, to assess a model’s long-term impact on citizens’ welfare, we would need a more dynamic analysis over the course of at least a decade.
Only then could we gauge how strongly investment and innovation would respond to incentives, how much free universal education would cost in the medium term, or how demographic structures would affect different social policies.
Economic analysis alone cannot settle the political debate between right and left.
What it can do is help to narrow and focus that debate.
The key is for participants on both sides to be more explicit about the values and objectives they believe that society should pursue, and to quantify their assumptions about how dynamic performance will respond to particular incentives.
Only then can a democracy choose effectively between potential paths.
Good economic analysis can enable “constructive populists” to debate the “post-fact, fanciful populists” who seem to be on the rise, with a realistic alternative discourse – one that is transparent and based on credible expectations of economic policies and outcomes.
In other words, economic analysis can facilitate good choices; it cannot make them.
Exposing Climate Change Obstruction
STANFORD – Twenty-five years after the adoption of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change on May 9, 1992, the world has yet to implement a treaty that effectively addresses global warming.
Now, following President Donald Trump’s withdrawal of the United States from the Paris climate agreement, it is time to investigate more deeply the forces driving delay.
Throughout the 1990s, the American Petroleum Institute (API) – the largest oil and gas trade association and lobbying group in the US – repeatedly relied on economic models created by two economists, Paul Bernstein and W. David Montgomery, to argue that pro-climate policies would be devastatingly expensive.
API successfully lobbied for delaying measures to address climate change solutions, using Bernstein and Montgomery’s projections to claim that job losses and economic costs would outweigh environmental benefits.
These arguments were used in 1991, to torpedo the idea of carbon dioxide controls; in 1993, against the Clinton administration’s proposed BTU tax (an energy surcharge that would have taxed sources based on their heat and carbon content); in 1996, against the goals of the UN Conference of Parties in Geneva (COP2); in 1997, against the goals of the UN Conference of Parties in Kyoto (COP3); and in 1998, against the Kyoto Protocol’s implementation.
The API’s lobbying plan was repetitive.
It also worked.
The oil and gas industry portrayed the reports it commissioned from Bernstein, who once worked at the Hawaiian Electric Company, and Montgomery, a former deputy assistant secretary for policy in the US Department of Energy, as factual, independent, and products of genuine economic debate.
In the run-up to the 1997 meeting in Kyoto, Japan, for example, the oil company Mobil claimed in an advertisement placed in The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times that “the cost of limiting emissions could range from $200 to $580 per ton of carbon,” based on “a study just issued by Charles River Associates.”
Mobil didn’t name who wrote the CRA report (Bernstein and Montgomery were the first two authors) or who funded it (API).
Mobil’s message was misleading, but was the analysis that Bernstein and Montgomery authored truly flawed?
Consider this: they ignored the negative costs of climate change, and suggested that clean energy would never be price competitive with fossil fuels, which is simply not true.
They assumed the result that they claimed to show.
The oil and gas industry was richly rewarded for abusing the public trust.
Americans eventually elected a president, George W. Bush, who bought the industry’s claims and pulled the US out of the Kyoto Protocol.
Sixteen years later, Trump stood in the White House Rose Garden and announced, with equal sophistry, that the Paris climate agreement would devastate the US economy and cost America some 2.7 million jobs, mostly in the construction industry, by 2025.
That accounting, Trump said last month, was “according to the National Economic Research Associates.”
In case you’re wondering, the first two authors of the report Trump cited – just published in March – are Bernstein and Montgomery.
This time, they were hired by the American Council for Capital Formation, a Washington, DC-based think tank and lobbying group with a history of commissioning deeply flawed work used to challenge climate policy.
Throughout the 1990s, the oil and gas industry and its allies perfected the art of blocking America’s support for key global climate-change initiatives.
The maestros, it appears, are back, and their repertoire hasn’t changed.
It never had to.
In addition to commissioning studies claiming that climate policies would hurt the US economy, the industry also consistently claimed that efforts to address global warming would be uniquely harmful to the US, would not reduce the risks of climate change, and would prevent poverty alleviation.
All three of these additional arguments also appear in Trump’s announcement on the Paris accord.
When a tortoise is sitting on a post, you know it didn’t get there by itself.
The reappearance of the same four arguments developed a quarter-century ago by an industry that benefits from delaying climate policies – arguments used with great success precisely because their origin and true purpose were hidden from the public – looks a lot like the tortoise’s four wiggling feet.
If history rhymes, here’s what we may expect in the months ahead: industry-sponsored economic “studies,” flashy online content, think tank reports, and polished front groups posing as grassroots organizations.
These are time-tested components of the strategy used by the fossil fuel industry and others to block, obstruct, and control climate policy.
We must not let the industry continue to obstruct climate policy.
That means following the money that funds the pseudo-science of delay, and exposing the co-opted scholars who feed false images of debate to the public.
The same arguments – and people – used by the fossil fuel industry to block climate policies decades ago are back.
For the sake of humanity, we must not let them succeed again.
Climate Leadership Means Ending Fossil-Fuel Production
VANCOUVER/BERLIN – The end of the fossil-fuel era is on the horizon.
With renewables like solar and wind consistently outperforming expectations, growth in electric vehicles far exceeding projections, and governments worldwide acknowledging the urgency of tackling climate change, the writing is on the wall.
And yet somehow, the question central to it all is not being seriously addressed: what is the plan for weaning ourselves off oil, coal, and gas?
That question is becoming increasingly urgent, because governments around the world, from Argentina to Canada to Norway, are supporting plans to continue producing fossil fuels and explore for more.
These governments claim that new fossil-fuel projects are consistent with their commitments under the Paris climate agreement, despite the fact that burning even the fossil fuels in already-existing reserves would push global temperatures higher than 2°C above pre-industrial levels – and thus far beyond the threshold established in that accord.
It is a startling display of cognitive dissonance.
The reality is that limiting fossil-fuel production today is essential to avoid continued entrenchment of energy infrastructure and political dynamics that will make shifting away from fossil fuels later more difficult and expensive.
Important questions about equity will arise: Who gets to sell the last barrel of oil?
Who pays for the transition to renewables?
And who compensates affected communities and workers?
But, ultimately, these questions must be addressed, within a broader context of climate justice.
Climate change has been called the moral challenge of our age.
This year alone, the world has faced unprecedented floods, hurricanes, wildfires, and droughts on virtually every continent.
Yet the real storm is yet to come.
If we are to avoid its most devastating impacts, phasing out coal – climate killer number one – will not be enough.
A safe climate future requires ending the age of Big Oil.
The good news is that social change is not a gradual, linear process.
Rather, it often happens in waves, characterized by “tipping point” moments brought on by the confluence of technological progress, financial incentives, political leadership, policy change, and, most important, social mobilization.
We seem to be closing in on just such a moment.
For starters, technology is advancing faster than anyone thought possible.
Twenty years ago, when we started working on climate issues, we sent faxes, made phone calls from landlines, and developed photos taken on 35mm film in darkrooms.
Another 20 years from now, we will be living in a world that is powered by the sun, the waves, and the wind.
Moreover, popular opposition to fossil-fuel development is mounting, generating political pressure and financial and legal risks.
Ordinary people everywhere have been working hard to halt projects inconsistent with a climate-safe future, whether by protesting against the Dakota Access Pipeline in the United States or the Kinder Morgan Trans Mountain Pipeline System in Canada; by joining the blockade by “kayactivists” of drilling rigs in the Arctic; or by using local referenda to stop oil and mining projects in Colombia.
Recently, over 450 organizations from more than 70 countries signed the Lofoten Declaration, which explicitly calls for the managed decline of the fossil-fuel sector.
The declaration demands leadership from those who can afford it, a just transition for those affected, and support for countries that face the most significant challenges.
Wealthy countries should lead the way.
Norway, for example, is not just one of the world’s richest countries; it is also the seventh-largest exporter of carbon dioxide emissions, and it continues to permit exploration and development of new oil and gas fields.
Proposed and prospective new projects could increase the amount of emissions Norway enables by 150%.
If Norway is to fulfill its proclaimed role as a leader in international climate discussions, its government must work actively to reduce production, while supporting affected workers and communities during the transition.
Canada, another wealthy country that considers itself a climate leader yet continues to pursue new oil and gas projects, should do the same.
Some countries are already moving in the right direction.
French President Emmanuel Macron has introduced a bill to phase out all oil and gas exploration and production in France and its overseas territories by 2040; the Scottish government has banned fracking altogether; and Costa Rica now produces the vast majority of its electricity without oil.
But the real work is yet to come, with countries not only canceling plans for new fossil-fuel infrastructure, but also winding down existing systems.
A fossil-free economy can happen by design or by default.
If we build it purposefully, we can address issues of equity and human rights, ensuring that the transition is fair and smooth, and that new energy infrastructure is ecologically sound and democratically controlled.
If we allow it simply to happen on its own, many jurisdictions will be stuck with pipelines to nowhere, half-built mega-mines, and stranded assets that weaken the economy and contribute to political polarization and social unrest.
There is only one sensible option.
Citizens around the world are championing a vision of a better future – a future in which communities, not corporations, manage their natural resources and ecosystems as commons, and people consume less, create less toxic plastic waste, and enjoy a generally healthier environment.
It is up to our political leaders to deliver that vision.
They should be working actively to engineer a just and smart shift to a future free of fossil fuels, not making that future harder and more expensive to achieve.

Shaping the Fourth Industrial Revolution
GENEVA – Of the myriad challenges the world faces today, perhaps the most overwhelming is how to shape the Fourth Industrial Revolution that began at the turn of the century.
New technologies and approaches are merging the physical, digital, and biological worlds in ways that will fundamentally transform humankind.
The extent to which that transformation is positive will depend on how we navigate the risks and opportunities that arise along the way.
The Fourth Industrial Revolution builds on the Third Industrial Revolution, also known as the Digital Revolution, which entailed the proliferation of computers and the automation of record keeping; but the new wave of transformation differs from its predecessors in a few key ways.
First, innovations can be developed and diffused faster than ever.
Second, falling marginal production costs and the rise of platforms that aggregate and concentrate activity in multiple sectors augment returns to scale.
Third, this global revolution will affect – and be shaped by – all countries, and have a systems-level impact in many areas.
The Fourth Industrial Revolution has the potential to empower individuals and communities, as it creates new opportunities for economic, social, and personal development.
But it also could lead to the marginalization of some groups, exacerbate inequality, create new security risks, and undermine human relationships.
If we are to seize the opportunities, and avoid the pitfalls, of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, we must consider carefully the questions that it raises.
We must rethink our ideas about economic and social development, value creation, privacy and ownership, and even individual identity.
We must address, individually and collectively, moral and ethical issues raised by cutting-edge research in artificial intelligence and biotechnology, which will enable significant life extension, designer babies, and memory extraction.
And we must adapt to new approaches to meeting people and nurturing relationships.
The scale of the challenge should not be underestimated.
The Fourth Industrial Revolution could lead to forms of human augmentation that cause us to question the very nature of human existence – and even sooner than one might imagine.
Consider the impact that mobile technology has already made on our lives and relationships.
As the novelty of wearable tech gives way to necessity – and, later, as wearable tech becomes embedded tech – will we be deprived of the chance to pause, reflect, and engage in meaningful, substantive conversations?
How will our inner lives and ties to those around us change?
These are weighty questions, about which debate will probably intensify in the coming years.
Of course, technology is not an exogenous force over which humans have no control.
We are not constrained by a binary choice between acceptance and rejection.
Rather, the decisions we make every day as citizens, consumers, and investors guide technological progress.
The more we think about those decisions, the more we examine ourselves and the social models on which we depend, the better our chances are of shaping the revolution in a way that advances our common objectives and upholds our values.
In this effort, new forms of collaboration and governance, accompanied by a positive shared narrative, will be essential.
To this end, three key steps are needed.
First, we must continue to raise awareness and understanding of the issues at stake.
Decision-making cannot occur in isolation.
We need an inclusive approach that brings together top minds from all over the world, from both the public and private sectors.
Second, we must develop comprehensive, constructive narratives about how the Fourth Industrial Revolution should develop.
For example, we should ensure that values and ethics are at the heart of our individual and collective behaviors, including in capital and financial markets.
We must move beyond tolerance and respect to genuine care and compassion, with empowerment and inclusiveness becoming guiding principles of our actions.
Third, we must move to restructure our economic, social, and political systems.
It is clear that our current governance structures and dominant models of wealth creation are not equipped to meet current or, more important, future needs.
What is needed now is not small-scale adjustments or marginal reforms, but comprehensive and innovative systemic transformation.
How the Fourth Industrial Revolution progresses will come down to people, culture, and values.
New technologies, however remarkable they might seem, are fundamentally just tools made by people for people.
We must keep this in mind, and ensure that innovation and technology continue to put people first, propelling us toward sustainable and inclusive development.
Once we get there, we can go even further.
I firmly believe that the new technology age, if shaped in a responsive and responsible way, could catalyze a new cultural renaissance that will create the sense that we are part of something much larger than ourselves – a true global civilization.
The Fourth Industrial Revolution can compromise humanity’s traditional sources of meaning – work, community, family, and identity – or it can lift humanity into a new collective and moral consciousness based on a sense of shared destiny.
The choice is ours.
The Coming French Revolution
PARIS – In a few weeks, France will elect its next president.
Given the French executive’s considerable powers, including the authority to dissolve the National Assembly, the presidential election, held every five years, is France’s most important.
But the stakes are higher than ever this time.
The two frontrunners are the far-right National Front’s Marine Le Pen and Emmanuel Macron, who served as economy minister under Socialist President François Hollande, but is running as an independent.
If, as expected, Le Pen and Macron face off in the election’s second round on May 7, it will be a political watershed for France: the first time in 60 years that the main parties of the left and the right are not represented in the second round.
France has not endured such political turmoil since 1958, when, in the midst of the Algerian War, General Charles de Gaulle came to power and crafted the Constitution of the Fifth Republic.
That shift, like any great political rupture, was driven by a combination of deep underlying dynamics and the particular circumstances of the moment.
Today is no different.
First, the underlying dynamic: the rise, as in most developed countries nowadays, of popular mistrust of elites, feelings of disempowerment, fear of economic globalization and immigration, and anxiety over downward social mobility and growing inequality.
These sentiments – together with the French state’s historical role in fostering national identity and economic growth – have contributed to a surge in support for the National Front.
Le Pen’s nationalist, xenophobic message and populist economic policies resemble those of the far-left candidate Jean-Luc Mélenchon.
Although support for the National Front has been growing for more than a decade, the party has so far been kept out of power by France’s two-round electoral system, which enables voters to unite against it in the second round.
And, given the National Front’s inability to make alliances, power has remained in the hands of the main parties of the left and the right, even as France has moved toward a tripartite political system.
Now, Macron is taking advantage of current circumstances to blow up the tripartite system.
Macron’s great insight, which few initially recognized, was that the right-left divide was blocking progress, and that the presidential election amounted to a golden opportunity to move beyond it, without the help of an organized political movement.
At a time when the French people are increasingly rejecting the traditional party system, Macron’s initial weakness quickly became his strength.
It helped that, as Macron himself recognized, both the right and the left have fragmented in recent years.
This is particularly true on the left, where a clear division has emerged between a reformist current, led by former Prime Minister Manuel Valls, and traditionalists, represented by the Socialist Party candidate, Benoît Hamon.
The Socialists’ problems are compounded by the existence of a radical left working actively to eliminate them, much as Spain’s left-wing Podemos party has sought to replace the Socialist Workers’ Party there.
The source of the mainstream right’s travails is less clear.
Its forces remain generally united on economic and social issues.
In fact, until a few months ago, its presidential candidate, the Republicans’ François Fillon, was expected to lead the pack in the first round by a wide margin.
But a scandal over his personal conduct (he allegedly paid his wife and children for non-existent jobs while he was a member of parliament) damaged his candidacy – probably fatally.
Whatever the reason for the right’s decline, Macron has benefited substantially from it, as well as from the rifts afflicting the left.
Now, there is a real chance the young independent could be elected president on May 7, upending the Fifth Republic’s political system.
But an electoral victory is just a first step.
To govern in France’s hybrid presidential-parliamentary system, Macron would need to secure a majority in the National Assembly.
This opens the possibility of two scenarios.
In the first scenario, Macron quickly gains a parliamentary majority, as French voters seek to reinforce his mandate in June’s National Assembly election.
This is conceivable, but not certain: it is here where the lack of an organized political movement on the ground remains a weakness for Macron.
That is why the June election could give rise to the second scenario: cohabitation with a parliamentary coalition comprising a small right-wing faction, a large centrist faction, and a hopelessly divided left-wing faction.
Such a development would be familiar in many European countries.
But in France, where republicanism gave rise to the left-right ideological spectrum that shapes politics throughout the West today, it would be a genuine revolution – one that could spell the end of the Socialist Party.
Given the symbolic power of the left-right divide, France’s voters and political leaders alike have long tended to frame virtually all of the country’s problems in ideological terms.
The public and its politicians have little experience with government based on broad coalition agreements.
This partly explains why the political system becomes gridlocked, sometimes making reforms difficult to implement, and why Macron’s message, which includes clear reform plans, is so unusual for France.
If Le Pen somehow comes out on top, French politics – not to mention the European Union – will be turned upside.
But even the ostensibly moderate Macron represents, in his own way, a truly radical stance.
With both candidates likely to make it to the second round, France is on the verge of a political revolution, regardless of who wins.
France’s Model of Resilience to Terror
PARIS – In a recent tweetstorm, US President Donald Trump shared anti-Muslim smears from the extreme-right hate group Britain First, thus reminding us of the deep divisions and fears that terrorism has injected into Western democracies.
But not everyone responds to terrorist attacks with the atavism of Trump or Britain First.
Take France, where on November 13, 2015, Islamic State (ISIS) militants carried out terror attacks on the Bataclan concert hall and other sites in Paris.
Although 130 people were murdered – more than in any other episode of violence against civilians in France since World War II – France’s commemoration of the second anniversary was extremely subdued.
French authorities, it seems, wanted to avoid reawakening the painful trauma of the event.
That trauma is a very real fact of life for the families who lost a loved one, and are permanently devastated, and for the survivors, whose experience has received little attention.
Much of the news coverage accompanying this anniversary showed that for most victims, even those who were not physically harmed, relearning “the next life” is an everyday ordeal.
Since the attacks, their relationship with their surroundings has been upset.
Sleep disorders, hallucinations, and depressive syndromes are common.
Entire lives have been transformed.
In a November survey published in Le Monde, many victims reported an inability to return to work.
And with each new attack, in France or elsewhere, the trauma is reawakened.
“Life goes on,” writes one survivor.
“But what life?”
On the other hand, French society has proved resilient.
After the Paris attacks, the French quickly showed that they would not give up their way of life, nor would they give in to the temptation of civil war.
There have been no significant outbursts against the country’s Muslim population.
The state of emergency that former President François Hollande declared immediately after the attacks allowed French authorities to ensure public order, by detaining suspects, conducting home searches, and closing certain places of worship.
Human-rights groups criticized some of these measures as violations of civil liberties; but, for the most part, they were applied smoothly.
On November 1, 2017, many of the same state-of-emergency measures, with some adjustments, were codified in law.
Despite some expected protests, the new anti-terrorism legislation enjoys wide support among the French, who seem willing to accept certain limitations to personal freedoms in the name of collective security.
Another consequence of the attacks is that international cooperation among security services has strengthened, new technologies have been adopted, and video surveillance has been implemented more widely.
Earlier this year, French President Emmanuel Macron established a specialized counter-terror task force at the Élysée Palace.
And, over time, armed soldiers – some of whom have been targets of new attacks – have become a familiar presence on French streets.
Still, a majority of French citizens remain deeply concerned about the threat of terrorism not just from abroad, but from people living in France, often with French citizenship.
And similar fears about homegrown extremism can be observed in many other European countries.
In recent years, some of those drawn to Islamist-inspired extremism have carried out attacks with rudimentary instruments, from cars and delivery trucks to kitchen knives.
Although violent extremists are an ultra-minority in the Muslim population, their actions have fueled a growing distrust in French society.
Worse still, the successful military campaign against ISIS raises new fears about violent extremists returning from Syria.
Already, more than 250 people, including nearly 60 children, have returned to France.
More often than not, they are picked up by law enforcement and brought to justice.
Yet dealing with returning women and children has become another controversy in itself.
And, in addition to the known militants, law-enforcement agencies must monitor thousands of other suspects.
This state of affairs inevitably affects French attitudes toward receiving migrants and refugees, most of whom come from predominantly Muslim countries.
It also has a profound impact on the unspoken but constant debate in France about the place of Muslims in French society.
While visible expressions of Islam have long been a source of controversy in France – owing to the country’s political and colonial history, conception of national identity, and cultural and legal secularism – similar debates are also playing out in Germany, the Netherlands, and other European countries.
In the two years since the ISIS attacks in Paris, France has readied itself to face the terrorist threat.
But the political consensus about how to tackle terrorism, which prevailed after the January 2015 attacks on Charlie Hebdo and the Hypercacher kosher supermarket, has eroded.
Some now want to dismiss terrorism as a feature of everyday life, as if extremist violence posed a danger similar to traffic accidents, alcohol, or disease.
These arguments will likely fall flat in France.
Even if the threat of terrorism will always exist, resilience must not become resignation.
If there is another serious attack, the French will undoubtedly hold their leaders accountable for failing to protect them.
And if elected officials have failed to take necessary precautions or demonstrated a sense of resignation, voters will let them know at the ballot box.
For proof, look no further than the success of right-wing parties in the last German and Austrian elections.
The Case Against Free-Market Capitalism
OXFORD – Free-market capitalism is on trial.
In the United Kingdom, Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn accuses neoliberalism of increasing homelessness, throwing children into poverty, and causing wages to fall below subsistence level.
For the defense, Conservative Prime Minister Theresa May cites the immense potential of an open, innovative, free-market economy.
Similar “proceedings” are taking place around the world.
Just a quarter-century ago, the debate about economic systems – state-managed socialism or liberal democracy and capitalism – seemed to have been settled.
With the Soviet Union’s collapse, the case was closed – or so it seemed.
Since then, the rise of China has belied the view that a state-led strategy will always fail, and the global financial crisis exposed the perils of inadequately regulated markets.
In 2017, few of the world’s fastest-growing economies (Ethiopia, Uzbekistan, Nepal, India, Tanzania, Djibouti, Laos, Cambodia, Myanmar, and the Philippines) have free markets.
And many free-market economies are suffering from growth slowdowns and rapidly rising inequality.
Against this background, some politicians are no longer defending free-market capitalism in terms of economic growth or the gains from globalization.
Instead, they focus on individual opportunity.
May, for example, has credited the system with reducing infant mortality, increasing life expectancy, driving down absolute poverty, boosting disposable incomes, expanding access to education, and slashing illiteracy rates.
But these claims aren’t in line with the facts.
Start with maternal mortality.
Much of the world has made great strides in making childbirth safer.
From 1990 to 2015, Albania reduced its maternal deaths per 100,000 live births from 29.3 to 9.6.
China, the poster child for state-led growth, reduced its rate from 114.2 to 17.7.
Meanwhile, the trend in the United States, the paragon of free-market democracy, has gone in the opposite direction, with maternal deaths per 100,000 live births actually rising, from 16.9 in 1990 to 26.4 in 2015.
Equally shocking, the morbidity and mortality of white (non-Hispanic) middle-aged men and women in the US increased between 1999 and 2013.
The claim that free-market policies “slash illiteracy” is also misleading.
In England, some 15% of adults (5.1 million people) are still “functionally illiterate,” meaning that they have literacy levels at or below those expected of an 11-year-old.
Scotland’s most recent survey showed a decline in literacy, with less than half of the country’s 13- and 14-year-olds now performing well in writing.
In fact, if you Google “successful literacy campaign,” the country with astonishing literacy gains that fills your screen is Cuba – hardly a free-market system.
The conservative case, eloquently articulated by May, is that a free-market economy, operating under the right rules and regulations, is the greatest agent of collective human progress ever created.
If that claim is true, the only logical conclusion is that we are doing it wrong.
So what measures are needed to get it right?
The practical solutions on offer seem to be fairly consistent across the political spectrum.
Indeed, for all their furious positioning, the differences between left and right seem to have collapsed in this regard.
In the UK, the first suggestion is to ensure economy-wide investment and growth, which will require government intervention.
Corbyn proposes a National Investment Bank and Transformation Fund to mobilize public investment and create wealth and good jobs.
May, for her part, suggests an industrial strategy to promote “growth across the whole country,” helping to “turn local areas of excellence into national export champions.”
Second, private-sector leadership must change, in order to prevent short-term thinking, tax avoidance, and other forms of opportunism and personal enrichment.
Here, Corbyn focuses on accountability in corporate boardrooms, while May calls for giving workers and shareholders a stronger voice in firms’ decision-making and ensuring that the largest companies have incentives to think long term.
A third corrective is to improve employees’ pay and working conditions.
In Britain, even as the economy has grown, wages have been dropping – by 10% from 2007 to 2014.
Corbyn promises to take action to stop employers from driving down pay and working conditions.
For May, “all work should be fair and decent, with scope for development and fulfillment.”
Both make the case for improving vocational training and technical education.
Fourth, in Britain, the government must address the public-housing crisis.
In the 1950s and 1960s, an average of some 300,000 houses were being built every year; that figure has now dropped to less than half.
Corbyn proposes a review of social housing, rent control, and regeneration for the people.
May has announced the creation of a £2 billion ($2.62 billion) fund for building more council housing.
Finally, Britain needs more effective rules and regulations to ensure that privatized utilities deliver cheaper, more sustainable services.
Corbyn accuses companies of handing out large dividends to shareholders, while infrastructure crumbles, service deteriorates, and companies pay far too little in taxes.
May promises to end “rip-off energy prices.”
The orthodoxy established by Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan in the 1980s – to roll back the state, after a decade of profligate and bloated government – is guilty as charged.
A new consensus is emerging that more active and effective government is required to boost growth and expand opportunity.
The jury is still out, however, on whether governments will be given the tools and support they need to rehabilitate the defendant.
The Not-So-Dire Future of Work
WASHINGTON, DC – The future of work is a hot topic nowadays.
It has inspired a seemingly endless train of analyses, commentaries, and conferences, and it featured prominently in last week’s annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
For good reason: new technologies – namely, digitization, robotics, and artificial intelligence – have far-reaching implications for employment.
But, contrary to how the story is often framed, a happy ending is possible.
The current debate often skews toward the melodramatic, foretelling a future in which machines drive humans out of work.
According to some bleak estimates, 47% of jobs are at risk in the United States; 57% in the OECD countries; two thirds in developing economies; and half of all jobs globally (around two billion).
But similarly dire predictions of large-scale job destruction and high technology-driven structural unemployment accompanied previous major episodes of automation, including by renowned economists.
John Maynard Keynes offered one; Wassily Leontief provided another.
Neither materialized.
Instead, technological change acted as a powerful driver of productivity and employment growth.
One key reason is that the technological innovations that destroy some existing jobs also create new ones.
While new technologies reduce demand for low- to middle-skill workers in routine jobs, such as clerical work and repetitive production, they also raise demand for higher-skill workers in technical, creative, and managerial fields.
A recent analysis estimates that new tasks and job titles explain about half of the recent employment growth in the US.
Given this, the evolution of work should be viewed as a process of dynamic adjustment, not as a fundamentally destructive process that we should seek to slow.
To erect barriers to innovation, such as taxes on robots, which some have proposed as a way to ease the pressure on workers, would be counterproductive.
Instead, measures should focus on equipping workers with the higher-level skills that a changing labor market demands, and supporting workers during the adjustment process.
So far, education and training have been losing the race with technology.
Shortages of the technical and higher-level skills demanded by new technologies are partly responsible for the paradox of booming technology and slowing productivity growth in advanced economies: skills shortages have constrained the diffusion of innovations.
Imbalances between supply and demand have also fueled income inequality, by increasing the wage premia that those with the right skills can command.
To address these shortcomings, education and training programs must be revamped and expanded.
As the old career path of “learn, work, retire” gives way to one of continuous learning – a process reinforced by the aging of many economies’ workforces – options for reskilling and lifelong education must be scaled up.
This will demand innovations in the content, delivery, and financing of training, as well as new models for public-private partnerships.
The potential of technology-enabled solutions must be harnessed, supported by a stronger foundation of digital literacy.
At a time of rising inequality – in the US, for example, gaps in higher education attainment by family income level have widened – a strong commitment to improving access for the economically disadvantaged is also vital.
At the same time, countries must facilitate workers’ ability to change jobs through reforms to their labor markets and social safety nets.
This means shifting the focus from backward-looking labor-market policies, which seek to protect workers in existing jobs, to future-oriented measures, such as innovative insurance mechanisms and active labor-market policies.
Moreover, social contracts based on formal long-term employer-employee relationships will need to be overhauled, with benefits such as retirement and health care made more portable and adapted to evolving work arrangements, including the expanding “gig” economy.
Here, several proposals have already been put forward, including a universal basic income, currently being piloted in Finland and some sub-national jurisdictions such as Ontario, Canada; a negative income tax; and various types of portable social security accounts that pool workers’ benefits.
On both of these fronts, France is setting a positive example.
Early this year, the country launched a portable “personal activity account,” which enables workers to accrue rights to training across multiple jobs, rather than accumulating such rights only within a specific position or company.
President Emmanuel Macron’s administration is now undertaking reforms to France’s stringent job protections, in order to boost labor-market flexibility.
Pursuing such initiatives simultaneously will enable France to capture reform synergies and ease the adjustment for workers.
Technological change will continue to pose momentous challenges to labor markets across economies, just as it has in the past.
But, with smart, forward-looking policies, we can meet those challenges head on – and ensure that the future of work is a better job.
A Volvo Moment for Antimicrobial Resistance
LONDON – Last week, Volvo issued an inspiring announcement: it will no longer produce gasoline- or diesel-fueled cars after 2019.
Volvo executives may be anticipating that traditional vehicles will be less profitable in the future.
But whatever their motive, their decision has resonated widely.
Within 24 hours, French President Emmanuel Macron announced that France would prohibit the sale of gasoline- and diesel-fueled cars by 2040.
Volvo’s decision confirms that things are changing for the auto industry, and it sends a positive message in the fight against climate change.
But, more important, it demonstrates that people and organizations are still capable of taking big, bold steps to solve major challenges.
Among the many global problems today, the fight against antimicrobial resistance (AMR) desperately needs a similar breakthrough commitment.
For advocates, AMR’s appearance on the G20’s agenda last year, at the group’s summit in Hangzhou, China, represented a major triumph.
But G20 leaders’ 2016 statement on AMR was not as bold as it could have been, because they did not want to set the bar too high.
They knew that Germany, an enthusiastic champion in the fight against AMR, would be chairing the G20 this year, and could be expected to bring bold proposals to the table.
In the run-up to this year’s G20 summit in Hamburg, I started to worry that Germany would fall short of these expectations.
But, if anything, Germany under-promised and over-delivered.
The lengthy communiqué issued at the end of the Hamburg summit includes a statement on AMR that is bolder than I would have expected.
Not only have G20 leaders reaffirmed their previous support for efforts by the World Health Organization, the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations, and the Organization for Animal Health to tackle AMR. They have also taken important steps in three crucial areas: agricultural usage, diagnostics, and the market for new useful drugs.
There are clear opportunities for breakthrough commitments in each of these three areas.
In agriculture, G20 countries have promised to restrict the use of antibiotics outside of veterinary medicine.
That alone is a big step forward, given that, in big countries such as the United States, and possibly China and India, antibiotics are now used more for growth promotion in agriculture than for fighting infections in humans.
The European Union has prohibited this practice for a decade now, but its policy has not spread globally because vested interests in major food-producing countries have stood in the way.
Still, countries such as the US and Brazil could now have their own “Volvo moments”: policymakers simply need to tell food producers what will and will not be allowed.
And the private sector, too, needs to show leadership on this front.
Food producers and retailers should follow in the footsteps of the Devon-based bacon producer that recently committed to using only antibiotic-free pigs.
Will Walmart, Asda, Tesco, and others now do the same?
To win the war against AMR, we must stop doling out antibiotics like sweets.
To that end, we will need new technologies and other measures to change how antibiotics are prescribed and administered.
For example, in the Review on AMR, which I chaired, we urged developed countries to require, by 2020, that certain diagnostic tests be conducted before antibiotics can be prescribed.
By enacting such a policy, any developed country can now establish itself as a global leader.
So, too, can companies that commit to providing the necessary diagnostic technology at an affordable price, or pharmaceutical companies that support such technologies as a complement to new gram-negative antibiotics, which will have to be set at a higher price to discourage overuse.
Which pharmaceutical company will be the Volvo or Tesla of its industry?
If one company takes the lead on developing new drugs to respond to antibiotic-resistant pathogens that the WHO has identified as urgent priorities, it will free others from their conventional strait jackets, and force them to stop thinking so narrowly about quarterly returns.
In the Review on AMR, we recommended 27 interventions that could solve the AMR crisis for a generation.
So far this decade, however, three US-based pharmaceutical manufacturers have already spent more money buying back their own shares than would be needed to see those interventions through.
Pharmaceutical companies have essentially become balance-sheet managers first, and drug makers second.
Someone needs to flip that model on its head.
The Review also proposed market-entry rewards to encourage innovation. If the major pharmaceutical producers were to make meaningful investments in antibiotics research, they could vastly improve the current environment for developing new drugs.
The G20’s proposed “R&D Collaboration Hub” will, one hopes, help in this effort.
Only when the industry comes together will AMR go the way of the gasoline- and diesel-powered car.
What’s Blocking Gender Equality?
BERKELEY – One year ago, the United Nations adopted the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), one of which aims for true gender equality by 2030.
Empowering women and girls is morally right and economically smart.
Several recent studies confirm that there are substantial economic- and human-development costs associated with pervasive and significant gender gaps in economic opportunities and outcomes.
A recent report by the UN Secretary-General’s High-Level Panel, which we authored, identifies actions that governments, businesses, nongovernmental organizations, and multilateral development agencies can take now to close these gaps and accelerate progress toward achieving the SDGs’ overarching goal of inclusive economic growth.
The report shows that greater gender equality in a country is associated with better education and health, higher per capita income, faster and more inclusive economic growth, and greater international competitiveness.
A widely cited McKinsey Global Institute study finds that closing gender gaps in labor-force participation rates, part-time versus full-time work, and the composition of employment would add 12-25% to global GDP by 2025.
Other studies, using a variety of methodologies, find similar prospective gains, especially in low-fertility countries such as Japan, South Korea, and Germany, and in countries (for example, in the Persian Gulf) with low labor-force participation rates for women.
The business case for gender quality is also compelling, because women make substantial contributions to all parts of the value chain.
The UN report identifies numerous benefits for companies that have pursued gender equality in employment, pay, and leadership, including the ability to attract, motivate, and retain talented workers, and to address complex problems with more diverse teams.
And several new studies find that companies with more women in top leadership and board positions have higher financial returns.
More than 90% of girls worldwide now finish primary school, and more women than men are now graduating from college in most regions.
Yet, despite these gains, large gender gaps persist in all kinds of work – whether paid or unpaid, formal or informal, public or private, agricultural or entrepreneurial.
Globally, only 50% of women aged 15 and above are in paid employment, compared with about 75% of men.
At the same time, women do about three times more unpaid work than men do.
When women are paid, their jobs tend to reflect gender stereotypes and provide relatively low earnings, poor working conditions, and limited opportunities for career advancement.
Even when women perform the same or equal-value jobs as men, they are paid less, on average (although the size of the pay gap varies considerably around the world).
Women are under-represented in leadership positions in both business and government.
And, compared to businesses owned by men, enterprises owned by women are smaller, employ fewer people, and are more concentrated in sectors with limited opportunities for profit and growth.
The UN report identifies four overarching and interconnected factors that impede gender equality in all forms of work, and at all levels of development: adverse social norms, discriminatory laws and insufficient legal protections, gender gaps in unpaid household and care work, and unequal access to digital, financial, and property assets.
Social norms determine economic outcomes for women in several ways: they shape women’s decisions about which occupational and educational opportunities to pursue; they affect the distribution of unpaid work within households and wages in paid care activities such as nursing and teaching, which employ a high proportion of women; and they reflect and reinforce discriminatory gender stereotypes and implicit biases that limit women’s pay and promotion prospects.
In many countries, adverse social norms are also codified in laws that limit women’s professional choices and their ability to obtain passports, travel outside their homes, start businesses, and own or inherit property.
A recent International Monetary Fund analysis finds that this kind of legal discrimination is associated with lower levels of educational attainment for women, wider gender-pay gaps, and fewer women-owned businesses.
Moreover, according to the World Bank, 103 countries do not legally mandate gender non-discrimination in hiring, and 101 do not require equal remuneration for work of equal value in formal-sector jobs.
Hundreds of millions of women work informally, without any protection, either in law or in practice, of their social and labor rights.
In India, for example, some 120 million women (around 95% of women in paid labor) work informally, as do around 12 million women in Mexico (around 60% of employed women).
People working informally often have no voice to demand better workplace conditions or pay, and this is especially true for women, who also face sexual harassment, violence, and restrictions on their reproductive rights.
Large gender gaps in unpaid work and care are a major driver of diminished economic opportunities for women.
The household work and care responsibilities of women are reflected in a sizeable “motherhood pay penalty.”
Around the world, mothers with dependent children earn, on average, less than women without dependent children, and less than fathers with similar household and employment characteristics.
In fact, there is some evidence of a “fatherhood pay premium” – a positive relationship between a man’s wages and how many children he has.
Reducing and redistributing the time required for unpaid care responsibilities requires investments by both the private and public sectors – in infrastructure, affordable care services, early childhood education, family leave, and family-friendly workplaces.
Such investments are beneficial not only for individuals and families, but also for businesses and the economy as a whole, because they increase women’s labor-force participation rates and productivity, create paid jobs in care services, and improve children’s school performance, boosting their future educational-attainment levels and productivity.
Drawing on evidence from around the world, the UN report provides numerous examples of proven and possible measures to tackle the constraints on women’s economic opportunities.
At this year’s annual World Bank and IMF meetings, world leaders sought policies to spur faster, more inclusive growth.
They would do well to move gender equality to the top of the list.
Germany’s Hour
LONDON – Who runs the European Union?
On the eve of Germany’s general election, that is a very timely question.
One standard reply is, “The EU’s member states” – all 28 of them.
Another is, “The European Commission.”
But Paul Lever, a former British ambassador to Germany, offers a more pointed answer: Berlin Rules is the title of his new book, in which he writes, “Modern Germany has shown that politics can achieve what used to require war.”
Germany is the EU’s most populous state and its economic powerhouse, accounting for over 20% of the bloc’s GDP.
Determining why Germany has been so economically successful appears to be elusive.
But three unique features of its so-called Rhineland model stand out.
First, Germany has preserved its manufacturing capacity much better than other advanced economies have.
Manufacturing still accounts for 23% of the German economy, compared to 12% in the United States and 10% in the United Kingdom.
And manufacturing employs 19% of the German workforce, as opposed to 10% in the US and 9% in the UK.
Germany’s success in retaining its industrial base contradicts rich countries’ standard practice of outsourcing manufacturing to locations with lower labor costs.
But Germany has never accepted the static theory of comparative advantage on which this practice is based.
True to the legacy of Friedrich List, the father of German economics, who wrote in 1841, “the power of producing wealth is therefore infinitely more important than wealth itself,” Germany has retained its manufacturing edge through a relentless commitment to process innovation, backed by a network of research institutes.
Its export-led growth has given it the benefit of increasing returns to scale.
The second feature of the German model is its “social market economy,” best reflected in its unique system of industrial “co-determination.”
Alone among the major advanced economies, Germany practices “stakeholder capitalism.”
All companies are required by law to have works councils.
Indeed, large companies are run by two boards: a management board and a supervisory board, divided equally between shareholders and employee representatives, which take strategic decisions.
The resistance to offshoring is therefore much stronger than elsewhere, as is a willingness to restrain wage costs.
Finally, there is Germany’s firm commitment to price stability.
Germany needed no lessons from Milton Friedman on the evils of inflation.
They were already hard-wired into its most famous post-war institution, the Bundesbank.
Lever suggests that it was as much the memory of the currency collapse of 1945-1948 as of the hyperinflation of the 1920s that drove home this lesson.
Likewise, an aversion to public deficits mirrors the population’s resistance to private indebtedness.
Institutionally, the EU has become Germany writ large.
The Commission, the European Parliament, European Council, and the European Court of Justice mirror the decentralized structure of Germany itself.
The EU’s gospel of “subsidiarity” reflects the division of powers between Germany’s federal government and states (Länder).
Germany ensures that Germans fill the leading positions in EU bodies.
The EU rules through its institutions, but the German government rules those institutions.
Yet talk of “hegemony,” or even “leadership,” is taboo in Germany – a reticence that stems from Germans’ determination not to remind people of their country’s dark past.
But denying leadership while exercising it means that no discussion of Germany’s responsibilities is possible.
And this inflicts costs – especially economic costs – on other EU member states.
Germany has created a system of rules that entrenches its competitive advantage.
The single currency rules out devaluation within the eurozone.
It also ensures that the euro is worth less than a purely German currency would be.
The EU’s recent Treaty on Fiscal Union – the successor to the Growth and Stability Pact – prescribes binding legal commitments to balanced budgets and modest national debt, backed by supervision and sanctions.
This precludes deficit finance to boost growth.
And Germany’s insistence that non-wage costs be equivalent throughout the EU is less a device for enhancing Germany’s competitiveness than for reducing others’.
The EU, especially the 19-member eurozone, thus functions as a vast home base for Germany, from which it can launch its assault on foreign markets.
And that base is strong.
Germany exports to the EU 30% more than it imports from it, and runs one of the world’s largest current-account surpluses.
This is a benign rather than a brutal hegemony.
But at its heart lies a massive contradiction.
National accounts must balance.
A surplus in one part of Europe means a deficit in another.
The eurozone was established without a fiscal transfer mechanism to succor members of the family who get into trouble; the European Central Bank is prohibited from acting as lender of last resort to the banking system; and the Commission’s proposal for Eurobonds – collectively guaranteed national bond issues – has foundered on Germany’s objection that it would bear most of the liability.
Germany has been willing to provide emergency finance to debt-strapped eurozone members like Greece on the condition that they “put their houses in order” – cut social spending, sell off state assets, and take other steps to make themselves more competitive.
The Germans see no reason to take measures to reduce their own super-competitiveness.
What can be done to achieve a more symmetric adjustment between Europe’s creditors and debtors?
Barring a fiscal transfer mechanism, John Maynard Keynes’s 1941 plan for an International Clearing Union might be adapted for the eurozone.
Member countries’ central banks would hold their residual euro balances in accounts with a European Clearing Bank.
Pressure would be simultaneously placed on creditor and debtor countries to balance their accounts, by charging rising interest rates on persistent imbalances.
An EU clearing union would be a less visible intrusion on German national interests than a fiscal transfer union would be.
The essential point, though, is that for the eurozone to work, the strong must be prepared to show solidarity with the weak.
Without some mechanism to realize that, the EU will limp from crisis to crisis – probably shedding members along the way.
A Test for Europe’s German Anchor
BERLIN – The outcome of Germany’s federal election holds a crucial lesson for the European Union: even the country that has been the EU’s bedrock of stability amid crisis is not immune to political fragmentation and polarization.
Although Chancellor Angela Merkel will almost certainly gain a fourth term, her new government is likely to be considerably weaker than the three that preceded it.
The Bundestag now counts six factions, compared to four in the previous electoral term.
Merkel’s center-right Christian Democratic Union took 33% of the vote, its worst result since 1949, though still enough to give the CDU the most seats in parliament.
The center-left Social Democrats (SPD) – Germany’s second-largest political party, and a part of Merkel’s last governing coalition – also hit a post-war low, receiving just 20.5% of the vote.
Meanwhile, the populist Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) won 12.6%, making this anti-euro, pro-Russia, and staunchly xenophobic party the first far-right party to enter the Bundestag in almost 60 years.
And the SPD has thrown in the towel, vowing to spend the coming electoral term in opposition.
In this context, Germany is likely to be ruled by a so-called Jamaica coalition, named for the colors of the parties – the CDU, the Greens, and the Free Democrats (FDP) – that would comprise it.
But such a coalition will be unruly, owing to the parties’ heterogeneous foreign-policy positions.
Similarly, the SPD-led opposition will be beset by deep divisions.
Indeed, it is unlikely to cooperate on any issue at all with its fellow opposition party, the AfD.
The SPD shares almost no values with the AfD, which has already declared that its main goal will be to hound the other parties with populist and nationalist bombast.
As a result, decades-old parliamentary norms of decorum and collegiality are in jeopardy.
Given the Bundestag’s central role in shaping Germany’s EU policy, this could weaken the capacity of Merkel’s government to provide the kind of leadership Europe now needs.
To be sure, there is some good news.
The victory of Merkel’s CDU, however weak, implies elements of continuity on which to build.
Merkel’s prompt decision to take responsibility for forming a viable coalition government means that her commitment to preserving the EU and her staunch defense of democracy and Western values will continue to guide German policymaking.
Moderation, stability, and international openness will remain Germany’s watchwords, no matter how much ugly rhetoric the AfD spews.
But, in terms of action on international challenges, Germany’s partners will have to be patient.
In particular, though Merkel is expected to cooperate closely with France’s pro-European president, Emmanuel Macron, to forge a new model of EU integration for the post-Brexit age, she is unlikely to do so right away.
The formation of a coalition alone – in particular, a conservative-liberal-green coalition – will likely take months.
Next month’s state election in Lower Saxony, where the AfD secured significant support, adds another element of uncertainty to the mix.
Even after that election, compromise may not come easily.
The Bavaria-based Christian Social Union (CSU) – the CDU’s sister party – will face a state election next autumn.
Feeling the hot breath of the AfD on its neck, the CSU has already sharpened its criticism of Merkel’s immigration policy, and is likely to try to push the chancellor further to the right in the coming year.
Perhaps the stickiest issue for the coalition parties will be the eurozone.
The stances of the FDP and the Greens are opposed on this front, particularly when it comes to joint crisis management, mutual insurance mechanisms, and fiscal tools.
But this struggle to find common ground may prove useful for the wider EU, as its leaders attempt to strike a balance between the responsibility of member governments and the eurozone-wide institutions that the monetary union needs to function effectively.
It may turn out to be easier for Germany’s coalition parties – not to mention the French and German governments – to forge a new framework for bilateral and European security cooperation.
Polls show that concerns about terrorism and internal security outweigh fears over immigration.
If those pressing issues are addressed at the European level, as Merkel suggested in her victory statement, support for Europe could end up winning back the discontented voters who cast their ballots for the AfD.
Whatever government emerges in Germany in the weeks ahead, its leaders will need to devote more effort to explaining their policy choices to citizens and international partners alike.
With the AfD in the Bundestag, the German public will be exposed to more radical positions on foreign affairs – from EU leadership to relations with Russia – than have been heard in over a generation.
While Germany’s center has held, its consensus is about to be tested.
The Populist Tail Wagging the German Dog
WARSAW – Initially, the big losers in Germany’s federal election in September were a Frenchman and a Luxembourger: French President Emmanuel Macron and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker.
Each has his own plan for reforming the European Union, and both envision deeper integration, starting with the eurozone.
For his part, Juncker has called on all non-euro member states to adopt the single currency, and has even proposed a roadmap for them to do so.
Macron, meanwhile, has called for a more deeply integrated eurozone with a common budget, which would be funded, in part, by an EU-wide financial transactions tax (currently only France and the United Kingdom levy an FTT).
He has also called for the appointment of a eurozone finance minister, and for measures to harmonize corporate taxes and minimum wages across member states.
Both Juncker and Macron’s plans would require German cooperation.
Germany, however, has little enthusiasm for EU-level economic reforms, because it benefits from the status quo.
A common monetary policy in the absence of a common fiscal policy creates an imbalance that works decidedly in Germany’s favor.
Because Germany, the eurozone’s largest economy, shares a currency with poorer member states, it enjoys an artificial boost to export competitiveness.
Moreover, while Germany is the world’s second-largest exporter (after China), it does not buy much with its surpluses, which means that other EU countries, particularly in the poorer south, cannot earn.
The result is a crisis-generating arrangement that has so far been impossible to correct, even with social transfers and other instruments to rebalance economic development across the eurozone.
Germany has essentially dropped an anchor that is now preventing all of Europe from moving forward.
And that would be the case even if German Chancellor Angela Merkel had managed to forge a coalition between her Christian Democratic Union (CDU), the Bavaria-based Christian Social Union (CSU), the Free Democrats (FDP), and the Greens.
After all, the FDP is essentially the political arm of German business.
Of course, things might be different if the Social Democrats (SPD) agree to rejoin the CDU and CSU in a grand coalition government.
But just how different remains unclear.
Having received its smallest share of the popular vote since World War II, the SPD is severely weakened, and may be unable to pursue anything but the least controversial items on its domestic agenda.
Hans Kundnani of the German Marshall Fund surmises that by voting for the Euroskeptic FDP and the far-right Alternative für Deutchland (AfD), rather than the CDU and SPD, German voters have already expressed their views on Macron’s plan to reform the eurozone.
If he is right, the SPD would be committing political suicide if it supported EU-level reforms.
Then again, all of the ongoing debates about EU reform could prove to be irrelevant, given that the power to decide the bloc’s fate may lie not in Western Europe, but in the East.
While Merkel weighs Macron’s proposals, she is undoubtedly thinking of Germany’s primary economic partner: the Visegrád Group (V4), comprising the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia.
The numbers speak for themselves.
According to the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung,the combined volume of trade between Germany and the V4 in 2016 was €256 billion ($303 billion), far outweighing China (€170 billion) and France (€167 billion).
The Czech and Slovak economies are often regarded as extensions of the German economy; and Germany is an equally crucial partner for Hungary and Poland.
Moreover, Germany’s trade with the V4 is growing fast, with a year-on-year increase of 9% in 2016, while its trade with France, traditionally its largest trading partner, grew at a sluggish 0.6% that year.
But while Germany has managed to assert its economic dominance across the region, it has also become more dependent on its increasingly populist eastern neighbors.
German businesses cannot simply replace their current trading partners on a whim.
And besides, no other region has the same ideal combination of low-cost labor, a well-educated workforce, high rates of economic growth, geographic proximity, and even political stability.
That’s right: while almost every other European country (including Germany) is struggling to form a government, or has settled for an unstable ruling coalition, the provincial strongmenin Poland, Slovakia, and Hungary can guarantee stability.
Whatever one thinks of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán and his brand of “illiberal democracy,” there is no denying that he has created a secure environment for German business interests.
The same cannot be said for Russia – whose volume of trade with Germany is only around the same as that of Hungary.
While Germany justifies its populist appeasement economically, other countries have also started to recognize the V4’s appeal.
Just this week, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang announced that the Chinese Development Bank will invest an additional €2 billion in Central and Eastern Europe.
China is positioning itself as an economic and technological rival to the EU and the United States.
And, because China itself is ceasing to be a source of cheap labor, it is looking for potential subcontractors – like the V4.
The title of the Bulgarian public intellectual Ivan Krastev’s new book says it all.
In English, it is After Europe; in French, it is Le destin de l’Europe (Europe’s Destiny); and in Germany, it is Europadämmerung (The Twilight of Europe).
The German edition is already a bestseller.
Germany, the G20, and Inclusive Globalization
BERLIN – Globalization is getting increasingly bad press in the West nowadays.
Populist movements allege that it does not benefit the average citizen very much, if at all.
Instead, they tout protectionism and unilateralism.
National policies, whether with respect to trade or financial regulation, are seen as the surest way to restore national greatness.
But this populist agenda is based on the deeply flawed premise that international cooperation and international trade are zero-sum games, producing only winners and losers.
In fact, cooperation and trade can deliver benefits to all countries.
For many years now, they have increased global security and certainly global prosperity, with hundreds of millions of people lifted out of poverty, both in the developed and the developing world.
To be sure, globalization needs rules and a recognized framework to ensure that it benefits everybody, delivering sustained and inclusive economic growth.
As with national legislation, it is a framework that requires constant adjustments.
But to abandon it altogether and retreat from globalization is the wrong answer.
On the contrary, we should be seeking ways to deepen and broaden international economic cooperation.
In my view, the G20 is the best forum for increased and inclusive cooperation.
Of course, the G20 is not perfect, but it is the best institution we now have for achieving a form of globalization that works for everyone.
Through it, the world’s main industrialized and emerging countries have worked together toward constructing a shared global order that can deliver increasing prosperity.
Indeed, the G20 is the political backbone of the global financial architecture that secures open markets, orderly capital flows, and a safety net for countries in difficulty.
The G20 has achieved much in recent years, including better coordination on financial regulation and international taxation.
And, as the country that holds the G20 presidency this year, Germany is committed to continuing the important work begun under our most recent predecessors in China and Turkey.
For example, more needs to be done to strengthen the global economy’s resilience against sudden shocks.
So one of the G20’s top priorities this year will be our work to prevent a recurrence of a global financial and economic crisis like that of 2008-2009, which stemmed from a myopic, debt-based growth model.
But, in order to tackle the gulf between the richest and the poorest countries, we need to go beyond the G20.
In particular, the G20 – indeed the entire world – must reach out to Africa at this critical moment in the continent’s development.
Beyond the moral question of raising Africans’ living standards, the continent’s development is crucial to reducing geopolitical risks.
But investment in Africa is still low, depriving people in African countries of opportunities to improve their lives.
For these reasons, the G20 during the German presidency is working to intensify its partnership with Africa.
A central pillar of this effort is the “Compact with Africa,” which provides a framework for supporting private investment, including in infrastructure.
We propose that, with the G20’s political backing, African governments, international organizations, and bilateral partners prepare comprehensive, country-specific investment compacts to encourage private-sector investment.
Each country is to implement a bespoke package of measures to decrease its investment risks.
Essentially, the Compact with Africa is a contribution to implementing the African Union’s Agenda 2063 blueprint for economic development.
That AU agenda provides guidance for improving macroeconomic, business, and financial frameworks across the continent.
While the Compact with Africa is open to all African countries, five have already committed to pioneering this new approach: the finance ministers of Côte d’Ivoire, Morocco, Rwanda, Senegal, and Tunisia want to work on compacts and have expressed this in writing.
I have invited them to attend the G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors meeting on March 17-18 in Baden-Baden.
At that meeting, my G20 peers and I will offer these countries an international platform to present their plans.
We want to discuss with them, and the heads of the African Development Bank, the World Bank, and the International Monetary Fund, what the elements of country-specific investment compacts could be.
Afterwards, these five countries, together with international organizations and bilateral partners, will select the specific measures and instruments to be included in each individual investment compact.
The G20 will provide high political visibility, helping to raise investors’ awareness of these changes.
I am confident that significant progress can be achieved when all partners involved work together closely and on an equal footing.
International cooperation is the only way to achieve strong, sustainable, balanced, and inclusive global growth.
Germany is committed to do its best as an honest broker within the G20 and beyond to ensure that globalization truly does benefit all.
Germany’s Götterdämmerung
MUNICH – Germany is experiencing a political watershed.
It is not just that the exit of the Free Democrats (FDP) from coalition talks has cast doubt on whether Chancellor Angela Merkel of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) will remain in power.
The FDP’s departure from negotiations with the CDU, its Bavarian sister party the Christian Social Union (CSU), and the Greens marks the end of a willingness to forge stable coalition governments that has defined German politics since the last days of Konrad Adenauer’s postwar chancellorship.
Of course, without the FDP’s participation, Merkel could pursue a coalition government with the Social Democrats (SPD).
But the decimated SPD says that it is determined to remain in opposition, in order to recover from its crushing defeat at the polls.
Any other possible coalition is out of the question, because neither the far left nor the far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) are seen as acceptable partners.
A minority government under Merkel, however, is conceivable.
Given that President Frank-Walter Steinmeier has expressed his distaste for calling a new election, such a scenario could become likely if Merkel does not resign on her own.
And even if there is a new election, the outcome would not be much different, unless SPD leader Martin Schulz steps down.
A minority government might be formed by the CDU and the CSU without the formal participation of other parties.
A minority coalition that included the Greens would force the CSU to compromise on migration issues and climate policy, which would be unnecessary otherwise, given the inability of the SPD, Die Linke (The Left), and the Greens to block legislation.
And Merkel herself will try to avoid a minority coalition with the FDP, in order to avoid becoming dependent on it.
The FDP, for its part, would like to participate in such a government for exactly that reason.
It would then be able to contain Merkel’s red-green affinity.
A minority government, whatever its composition, would not necessarily be a bad thing.
With the government seeking partners to enact legislation on an ad hoc basis, the Bundestag would finally become the site of genuine public debate once again.
For too long, coalition partners have negotiated government decisions behind closed doors, with the Bundestag either rubber-stamping or vetoing the results.
Those who stand to gain the most from such a strengthening of parliament will be the small parties that otherwise have little chance of asserting their influence.
Above all, the AfD, Germany’s version of the French National Front, which emerged from nothing as Germany’s third-largest party in the September election, will benefit from open debate.
So far, the media have largely focused on discrediting the party.
But a more proactive Bundestag would inevitably become a showcase for the AfD’s arguments and rhetoric.
At the same time, a minority federal government’s foreign policy would undoubtedly be weakened, and Merkel would find it difficult to play an active part in European politics.
This would also mean, however, that Germany’s European partners would struggle to force compromise upon the German government.
This dynamic will be particularly important for France, given President Emmanuel Macron’s goal of consolidating the eurozone by providing it with more attributes of statehood, and his desire to push ahead with a two-speed Europe comprising a eurozone and a large non-euro fringe consisting of northern and eastern EU countries.
A German minority government would have to hold lengthy debates with all of the Bundestag’s parliamentary groups on every major decision before it could assent to Macron’s proposals – or any other, for that matter.
Effective opposition at home means that the government would no longer be able to acquiesce in the dead of night to various rescue operations for Germany’s EU partners.
That’s what happened in May 2010, when Merkel’s government was forced by the French triumvirate of European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet, IMF Managing Director Dominique Strauss-Kahn, and French President Nicolas Sarkozy to violate the Maastricht Treaty by establishing a rescue fund for Greece’s foreign creditors, primarily French banks.
Germany was also forced to compromise in 2012, when Merkel was pushed into agreeing to a banking union and the ECB’s “outright monetary transactions” program, which effectively turned European government bonds into Eurobonds.
Likewise, kneejerk decisions by Merkel – such as her move to phase out nuclear power within a few months of the Fukushima accident in Japan, or to allow refugees to enter Germany from safe third countries – will now be impossible.
That is welcome, because too often politicians, driven by the momentum of their own thoughts, make decisions that have serious adverse consequences in the long term.
With the nuclear phase-out, for example, Germany can now honor its commitments to combat climate change only by damaging, and perhaps losing, part of its industrial base.
By admitting 1.5 million migrants in just two years, Germany has also placed a massive burden on its welfare state, inadvertently encouraged the Brexiteers, and rallied all of Eastern Europe against it.
It is too early to tell how the political uncertainty now confronting Germany and Europe will be resolved.
But a Merkel who can be called to account by the Bundestag may be the best alternative Germany has.
While Germany Slept
BERLIN – Few people outside Germany are familiar with the caricature of themselves that many Germans hold in their minds.
Far from the aggressive bully of twentieth-century war propaganda, the perfectionist engineer of Madison Avenue car advertisements, or the rule-following know-it-all of the silver screen, the German many picture today is a sleepy-headed character clad in nightgown and cap.
Sometimes clutching a candle, this German cuts a naïve, forlorn figure, bewildered by the surrounding world.
This figure is not new.
On the contrary, referred to as “Der deutsche Michel” or “the German Michel,” it was popularized in the nineteenth century as a character whose limited perspective causes him to shun great ideas, eschew change, and aspire only to a decent, quiet, and comfortable life.
But Michel has now made a comeback.
And who can blame him?
Germany now boasts a booming economy, near full employment, rising wages, and content unions.
The financial crisis is long forgotten, public budgets are under control; and the 2015 influx of migrants has been relatively well managed.
What bad news there is – industrial scandals (like that at Volkswagen), airline bankruptcies, endlessly delayed infrastructure projects – does little to dampen the general sense of safety and wellbeing enjoyed by Germany’s Michels.
The only real threat, it seems, is the world outside Germany’s borders.
In this sense, last autumn’s election campaign was perfectly suited to Germany’s Michels.
“A land where we live well and happily,” the campaign slogan of Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union (CDU), resonated with them, as did the rather provincial and mostly empty messages of rival parties.
With the exception of the right-wing populist Alternative für Deutschland (AfD), the parties displayed a rote civility and drowsy acceptance of consensus that pacified the electorate.
After the election, the real politicking began, but even then, pains were taken to obscure those activities from Germany’s Michels.
Indeed, though party officials had been in place for some time, they waited until the votes were cast before putting their cards on the table, and even then did so behind closed doors.
Even the leaks from these closed-door coalition talks were so well managed that they created the illusion that the “Sondierungsgespräche” – that is, the preparatory talks among party officials – were politically rather harmless.
But Germany’s political class, like its ordinary Michels, are in denial.
The soporific federal elections, the breakdown of coalition talks among the CDU, its Bavarian sister party the Christian Social Union (CSU), the Greens, and the Free Democrats (FDP), and the timid dance between the CDU and the Social Democratic Party (SPD) since then all point to a serious deficit in German politics.
The truth is that the various party platforms, meant to inform the electorate and provide a basis for coalition talks, reveal a shocking lack of imagination and paucity of new ideas.
Second-order issues are presented as red lines, with largely technical questions – for example, about refugee family reunions, a new health insurance scheme no one asked for (Bürgerversicherung), or the role of the federal government in funding education – taking center stage.
Considering the state of Europe and the world – and the hopes many outsiders are pinning on German leadership – these issues seem rather marginal.
But the real problem is that they are distracting from larger issues relating to, say, the euro, security and defense, migration, infrastructure, and taxation.
Lacking any forward-looking political visions, German politics has degenerated to tactical plays being carried out by established players.
The CDU, in a War of the Roses with the CSU, can live neither with or without Merkel, while the SPD is unsure of itself and fears further political decline.
None of this bodes well for a country whose parliament has already been diminished, after these three parties, during their eight years forming a coalition government, marginalized the opposition and failed to build up new leadership cadres.
Coalition agreements in Germany have always been elaborate documents of a quasi-contractual nature.
But there is a growing tendency to plan out four years of governing, with leaders then using legislative periods not to debate laws, but rather to enact previously agreed policies.
Moreover, no major reform has been successfully implemented in Germany since the 2000s, when Chancellor Gerhard Schröder pushed through labor-market reforms.
No forward-looking reforms of the caliber of Schröder’s Agenda 2010 were even attempted under Merkel in over a decade.
The CDU/CSU and the SPD are now pursuing a grand coalition that would keep Germany roughly on the same path it has taken during the last eight years.
The 28-page agreement that will allow formal coalition talks to proceed is overly detailed, technocratic, unambitious, and lacks vision.
It is thus unsurprising that, though CDU/CSU and SPD negotiators have touted the deal as a breakthrough, many, especially in the SPD, are unhappy with the outcome, with some calling for renegotiation.
The SPD now faces a choice: at its special party congress this weekend, its leaders must decide whether to join yet another grand coalition government that promises more of the same, or move into opposition, probably triggering new elections.
But there is another option, which many have ignored: a CDU-led minority government, with Merkel as chancellor.
Freed of stifling coalition agreements with a reluctant SPD or a coldly calculating FDP, Merkel could choose her cabinet based on competence and vision, rather than party politics.
She could even appoint ministers from other parties.
Most important, Merkel could finally tackle the important issues that have fallen by the wayside in recent years, to which the current coalition agreement pays only lip service.
This means cooperating with French President Emmanuel Macron to move the European project forward; modernizing Germany’s public administration system; preparing the labor force for digitization; and tackling immigration issues.
Parliament is integral to success on any of these fronts.
Mainstream parties must embrace the kind of open and constructive debate that nurtured parliamentary democracy in the Federal Republic’s early years, rather than remaining focused on political tactics.
Michel may prefer the modest policy initiatives and incrementalism that have characterized Merkel’s chancellorships.
But a minority government forced to muster coalitions of the willing to address the critical issues confronting Germany and Europe could escape the constraints of Michel’s expectations, freeing German politics from party tacticians and enabling real and much-needed reform.
In other words, the modicum of political insecurity Germany faces today may well be just what the country needs to give rise to new ideas and voices, and a better future.
Germany’s Economic Road Ahead
MUNICH – The next German government will face economic-policy challenges in five key areas: digitalization and automation, demographic change, globalization, climate change, and European integration.
With respect to digitalization, Germany tends to fluctuate between excessive enthusiasm for expanding fiber-optic networks and fear of the impact of new, largely unregulated business models, such as those underpinning avatars of the “sharing economy” like Uber and Airbnb.
But German policymakers must not respond to such sentiments with kneejerk reactions.
Rolling out a nationwide fiber-optic network, rather than simply servicing the locales that are most in need, would be both expensive and inefficient.
And politicians should focus their regulatory efforts on ensuring that sensible digital business models and private investment are not obstructed.
With digitalization also comes automation and robotization, which many fear will lead to job losses.
Consequently, one now regularly encounters proposals for an unconditional universal basic income (UBI), to be paid for, perhaps, with a tax on robots.
But such a response would be a terrible mistake – a capitulation to the challenges that we face.
Instead of making a large swath of the population dependent on transfers earned by others, Germany’s leaders should ensure that all workers receive the training needed to pursue opportunities in the labor market of the future.
As it happens, Germany’s aging population and declining workforce will create labor shortages in the years ahead.
But instead of seizing the opportunity in front of them, German policymakers have been busy worrying about the elimination of skilled labor altogether.
These fears make no sense.
In 1900, 38% of the labor force in Germany worked in agriculture; in 2000, only 2% did.
And yet the full-scale automation of agriculture did not lead to mass unemployment.
Germany’s demographic transformation will have significant implications for the country’s public finances, and especially for its social-insurance system.
But in the recent federal election campaign, both of Germany’s main political parties ruled out proposals to raise the retirement age to 70, even though there are good reasons for doing precisely that.
Raising the retirement age to shore up a statutory pension scheme is often denounced as unfair, because people with physically demanding jobs, such as nurses and manual laborers, cannot be expected to work until they are 70.
But that is a problem that should be addressed through higher wages and disability insurance, not with pension insurance.
And besides, early retirement can still be made an option, as long as it is marked down accordingly.
Globalization – whether it takes the form of migration or flows of trade, capital, and data – poses an equally large challenge, even though it has been a boon to Germany in recent decades.
Generally speaking, globalization implies a narrower scope for national policy.
And this is particularly true for Germany, because it has signed on to international agreements brokered by the European Union as a whole.
Growing cross-border mobility has put Germany under severe competitive pressure.
Germany wants to attract companies and investment, but it also wants to create as many high-paying jobs as possible.
Germany thus benefits from immigrants with above-average qualifications, because they will earn enough to pay more in taxes than they receive in state benefits.
To bring in capital and high-skill immigrants, Germany needs to keep taxes low.
But this limits its ability to use taxation as a mechanism for redistribution.
For now, Germany can still finance its welfare state.
But with such a globalized economy, it cannot count on subsidies funded by general tax revenues to offset future shortfalls in its social-security system.
More to the point, Germany cannot indefinitely keep taxes low while offering generous social transfers to lower-skill workers; eventually, its welfare system would collapse.
And the government should work with other countries and within the EU to ensure that immigration is not motivated by a desire for welfare benefits.
To remain competitive, Germany needs to change how it taxes investment and innovation.
French President Emmanuel Macron’s government has announced plans to abolish France’s wealth tax and significantly reduce its corporate-tax rate.
The governments of Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States have also announced plans to cut taxes.
The German government, whether it likes it or not, cannot escape the effects of global tax competition.
But as it looks for ways to improve its tax regime, it must not allow certain sectors – not least those with heavily digitalized business models – to evade taxation entirely.
Climate change is another facet of globalization, because here, too, there is nothing that Germany can do by itself to halt global warming.
Rather, the government must work with its European partners to forge global climate agreements, while enacting measures to mitigate the effects of climate change at home.
But as Germany pursues its emissions reductions, it should keep an eye on cost-effectiveness, because no climate agenda can succeed without social acceptance.
Viewed from this perspective, selective interventions, such as a proposed ban on internal combustion engines after 2030, would thus be counterproductive.
A far better approach would be to include road traffic in the emissions-metering system under the Paris climate agreement, because this would allow emissions cuts to be made at the lowest possible cost.
The last major challenge for Germany’s next government is its policy toward Europe.
Germany needs the EU to surmount its current crisis, deepen the internal market, and develop a common defense and security policy, so that it can reap the benefits of European integration.
Joint arms procurement and closer operational cooperation would yield significant efficiency gains, and reduce the burden on EU member states’ budgets.
Moreover, the European Monetary Union is in desperate need of reform.
Instead of waiting for the next crisis to erupt, Germany should see to it that European banks hold fewer domestic government bonds.
In cases where individual member states have incurred too much debt, private creditors – not taxpayers of other countries – should bear the burden of debt restructuring.
The Chimera of Franco-German Reform
CAMBRIDGE – An abiding truth in the United States is that all politics is local.
Apparently, the same wisdom can be applied (to some extent) to the European Union, whose agenda ultimately depends on key member states’ national politics.
This is particularly true with respect to eurozone institutions, which almost everyone agrees are in urgent need of reform.
Indeed, shoring up the eurozone was the common thread in major speeches by European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and French President Emmanuel Macron last month.
In his State of the Union address, Juncker boldly outlined his ambitious vision for Europe’s future.
He called on the EU to complete its banking union, establish a European finance ministry (fully integrated into the Commission), and expand the EU-level budget.
Macron, in a speech at the Sorbonne, touched on issues ranging from defense and security to eurozone reform and Europe’s political divides.
But he left much unsaid.
And, in line with his role as a national leader, his was an inter-governmental, not a community perspective.
Still, both speeches were clearly intended to frame the political debate now underway in Germany, where Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union (CDU) is trying to form a new coalition government.
Many observers had hoped that Germany’s recent federal election would open a “window of opportunity” for EU-level reforms.
But it is now starting to look like that window has already closed.
The fate of any EU agenda – whether Juncker’s or Macron’s – rests with Merkel, who is unlikely to make any significant political moves.
Indeed, bold action of the type Juncker and Macron have proposed would not just be uncharacteristic for Merkel; it would also require her to invest all of her remaining political capital.
Throughout her career, Merkel has always behaved, not unreasonably, as if her main goal was to be reelected.
And because the CDU would prefer to dominate a government – and if possible, govern without coalition partners – it has always sought to win a majority by appealing to German voters in the middle of the political spectrum.
Merkel has a keen sense of where the middle is, and how and when it might shift.
Accordingly, she often adopts her competitors’ ideas.
While in office, she has established a minimum wage, lowered the retirement age to 63 (for those with 45 years of contributions), and legalized same-sex marriage – policies that are anathema to traditional conservatism, but that now have broad popular support.
As the American economist Harold Hotelling explained in 1929, those competing for the middle have an “undue tendency … to imitate each other.”
Accordingly, the CDU and its main competitor, the Social Democrats (SPD), have become increasingly indistinguishable.
And, as a corollary, smaller parties seeking an electoral foothold have had to target political minorities, many of whom have strongly held preferences and beliefs.
Because the CDU and the SPD lost support in the recent election, with the latter deciding to spend the coming electoral term in the opposition, Merkel will need to form a coalition with such parties.
But no mainstream German party, let alone Merkel’s, would govern with the third-largest faction in the Bundestag, Alternative for Germany (AfD), a far-right anti-EU party that garnered 13% of the vote.
That leaves the Free Democrats (FDP), who are liberal in a European sense, but also frustrated with the eurozone’s malaise.
Giving voice to German “transfer fatigue”, the FDP is adamantly opposed to any arrangement that transfers German money to underperforming member states.
During the campaign, the FDP thus drew a red line against furnishing the EU with a fiscal capacity, under any guise.
Two other FDP proposals – a sovereign-debt-restructuring mechanism, to force creditors to take responsibility for their decisions, and temporary withdrawal from the common currency for over-indebted member states – could further complicate matters for eurozone reformers.
The FDP’s ideas have broad support in Germany and among German economists (and are shared by a number of other European economists).
And they are consistent with positions taken by the German Ministry of Finance under the previous government.
But policies that might work in a perfect world of efficient and resilient financial markets could be dangerous if applied in highly imperfect real-world markets.
As we saw a decade ago, financial institutions operating in an environment of uncertainty can become fragile and collapse, imposing high costs on society.
The idea of a temporary exit from the euro is particularly ill-advised.
If that option were formalized, markets would price it in, and member states without deep capital markets would pay a premium.
Their interest rates would be structurally higher.
And under volatile conditions, they are prone to face runs from fickle institutional investors, wary of rolling over their credit lines.
The FDP campaigned on an exit option, and its leaders, having been out of parliament for four years, will not want to risk their credibility by backing away from it now.
And besides, some deputies in the CDU, and many in its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union, are sympathetic to the FDP’s positions.
The third likely member in Merkel’s new coalition, the Greens, would hardly be able to counterbalance these internal forces.
Another problem is that neither Juncker nor Macron has offered much in the way of detail.
The actual design of a future eurozone budget – and the types of expenditure it would include – is still unclear.
So, too, is the process for holding a eurozone finance minister accountable and ensuring his or her democratic legitimacy.
It is also not evident how much national sovereignty would be lost, in the name of a shared fiscal capacity.
Sorting out these questions will require a level of political entrepreneurship unlike anything Merkel has ever shown.
To join in Macron’s European project, she would have to assume an entirely new role and expose herself to substantial political risks.
Germany would have to take the initiative: rather than rejecting proposals, it would have to offer its own.
Such behavior can hardly be expected from a government that, beholden to the median German voter, plays it safe.
The German political center has been shifting, and it is heading in a different direction than Juncker and Macron.
As a result, the eurozone’s institutional design will likely remain incomplete.
Plan B for the Global Economy
HONG KONG – In March, meetings of the G-20, the Chinese National People’s Congress, and multiple think tanks all reflected a growing awareness of the risks to the global economy posed by deflation and intensifying financial instability.
In mitigating these risks, the path that China takes will be particularly important.
But avoiding a hard landing in China is a necessary but insufficient condition for global recovery.
Contrary to the advice of many Chinese economists, the country’s policymakers have opted not to follow the conventional Western approach of using flexible exchange rates as the main shock absorber for volatile capital flows and thereby freeing monetary policy to provide liquidity for domestic structural adjustments.
This satisfied both Western economists and global financial markets, which breathed a collective sigh of relief when Chinese leaders reaffirmed their commitment to maintaining a stable renminbi.
The fear was that, if China sought a weaker exchange rate to escape deflation, the result would be another round of global competitive devaluations and even more deflation.
Fortunately, China’s leaders recognize that, if the world remains mired in a balance-sheet recession, the lack of aggregate demand, by continuing to weaken trade, will drag down their own country’s growth.
But, of course, China still needs to find a way to cope with capital outflows, while pursuing the structural reforms that are needed to place its economy on a sustainable long-term growth path.
As we recently argued, the key will be to maintain an annual growth rate of roughly 6.5%, while pursuing a multifaceted short-term stabilization plan that aims to stimulate job creation to offset the losses from restructuring inefficient industries and eliminating excess capacity.
Meanwhile, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) would face the unenviable task of both maintaining exchange-rate stability and combating deflation, by ensuring that the liquidity needed to support the shift away from manufacturing toward services and consumption is available at reasonable rates.
Given how much of its official reserves China has already spent stimulating the economy and stabilizing the exchange rate, as well as the size of capital outflows – equivalent to three times the current-account surplus last year – tactics like reducing reserve requirements would be key here.
The PBOC would, of course, have to tighten controls on foreign exchange.
But it is also contemplating other macro-prudential instruments, such as a kind of Tobin tax, the levy on financial transactions first suggested in 1972 by the Nobel laureate economist James Tobin, in order to discourage volatile capital flows.
All of this amounts to Plan A – an unavoidable strategy for stopping deflation in China.
But, in today’s multipolar global system, no single country can save the global economy from debt deflation.
That is why the world must also consider implementing a shared strategy; call it Plan B.
Of course, collective action will not be easy – not least because some measures, such as a global monetary or fiscal policy, were ruled out at the 1944 Bretton Woods conference, where world leaders created the international economic and financial architecture that prevails today.
But, in the face of unprecedented threats to global economic stability, it may be time to convene another Bretton Woods-type conference to determine what collective measures are possible.
There is plenty of incentive for action.
With the advanced economies facing rapid population aging, large public-debt burdens, overstretched monetary policies, and fractious politics, the global economy’s capacity to escape its current rut depends largely on the emerging economies.
After all, while these economies are facing challenges of their own, they enjoy more favorable demographics and are experiencing rapid urbanization.
As a result, they have huge potential for productivity gains, which would strengthen global economic growth, and massive demand for sustainable infrastructure to reduce resource depletion and address global warming.
The main constraint on realizing the emerging economies’ potential is financial, with the Bretton Woods institutions unable to provide the needed capital.
If the world is to escape the debt-deflation trap – not to mention address rising income and wealth inequality – this must change.
The recent panic over the renminbi’s depreciation highlights another compelling reason for collective action.
In today’s world, nobody is safe from large and volatile capital flows – not even countries that have built up huge amounts of self-insurance in the form of foreign-exchange reserves.
In 2007-2009, the advanced economies managed to escape a liquidity crisis, largely because the US Federal Reserve was willing to engage in liquidity swaps with key central banks, mostly those of US allies.
Only with a global liquidity-insurance system – underpinned by multilateral currency-swap arrangements – can countries pursue much-needed reflation, without excessive fear of capital flight and/or exchange-rate devaluation.
Finally, collective action is needed to make unconventional monetary policy more effective.
Thus far, such policies have failed to revive the global economy largely because commercial banks and other lenders retained the liquidity they received from their central banks, instead of channeling it to the real economy by providing credit to small and medium-size enterprises and investing in long-term infrastructure projects.
It is no coincidence that from 2010 to 2014, the largest banks, firms, and investment funds increased their cash holdings by $3 trillion – roughly the amount by which central banks in reserve-currency countries expanded their balance sheets over the same period.
By enabling countries to eliminate excess capacity, reduce leverage, and balance tax policies – all while reducing geopolitical uncertainty – collective action to escape deflation and boost growth would mitigate financial institutions’ risk aversion, thereby improving the transmission mechanisms of unconventional monetary policies.
Reaching global consensus is always difficult. But, in today’s context, there is no avoiding it.
If countries continue to try to go it alone, the entire world will suffer.
Preempting the Next Pandemic
SYRACUSE – Recent disease outbreaks, like Ebola and Zika, have demonstrated the need to anticipate pandemics and contain them before they emerge.
But the sheer diversity, resilience, and transmissibility of deadly diseases have also highlighted, in the starkest of terms, just how difficult containment and prevention can be.
One threat to our preparedness is our connectedness.
It was thanks to easy international travel that in recent years the dengue, chikungunya, and Zika viruses were all able to hitch a ride from east to west, causing massive outbreaks in the Americas and Caribbean.
Another threat is more mundane: failing to agree about money.
Whatever the reason, the fact is that as long as humans fail to organize a collective and comprehensive defense, infectious diseases will continue to wreak havoc – with disastrous consequences.
Building an effective prevention and containment strategy – being bio-prepared – is the best way to reduce the threat of a global contagion.
Preparedness requires coordination among agencies and funders to build networks that enable quick deployment of and access to vaccines, drugs, and protocols that limit a disease’s transmission.
Simply stated, preparing for the next pandemic means not only building global capacity, but also paying for it.
That’s the idea, at least.
The reality of bio-preparedness is far more complicated.
For starters, the absence of dedicated funding is impeding implementation of long-term prevention strategies in many countries; a new World Bank report finds that only six countries, including the United States, have taken the threat seriously.
Meanwhile, public health officials in many parts of the world struggle to respond to disease outbreaks, owing to a dearth of labs and clinics.
And many funding agencies, including governments and NGOs, typically offer only one-year commitments, which rules out long-term planning.
For years, scientists, physicians, and civil-society actors have voiced concern over the lack of reliable, meaningful, and institutionalized investment in pandemic preparedness.
These pleas have come, frustratingly, as military funding to thwart bio-attacks, consciously mounted by human actors, has remained robust.
But while purposeful and nefarious infectious-disease outbreaks could do massive damage, they remain relatively unlikely.
Naturally occurring outbreaks, by contrast, occur regularly and are far more costly, even if they lack the sensational “fear factor” of bioterrorism.
Not that long ago, those of us engaged in the prevention of infectious-disease outbreaks felt more secure about the availability of the resources required to prepare.
But in many places, budgets are stagnating, or even declining.
This is astonishingly shortsighted, given the relative costs of prevention versus response.
For example, what would it have cost to build the clinical and laboratory infrastructure and provide the training needed to identify and prevent the recent Ebola outbreak in West Africa?
Precise figures are elusive, but I have no doubt it would have been less than the billions of dollars spent on containment.
Preparedness pays.
It is not only the lack of funding that is raising alarms; so are restrictions on how available funds can be used.
It is not uncommon for a grant to be restricted to specific activities, leaving major gaps in a program’s capacity to meet its objectives.
A funder may, for example, allow the renovation of an existing lab but not the construction of a new one; or funds may support the purchase of a diagnostic machine but not the training of those required to operate it.
In many developing countries, communities do not even have the physical buildings in which to test, monitor, or store dangerous pathogens.
Myopic funding that overlooks key elements of the big picture is money poorly spent.
Add to these challenges the difficulty of paying staff or ensuring reliable electricity and other essential services, and it becomes clear that preparing for disease outbreaks requires broad engagement with the international aid community.
But at the moment, onerous spending rules and weak financial commitments are tying the hands of those working to prevent the next serious disease outbreak.
The number of obstacles faced by scientists and public health experts in the race to contain deadly infectious diseases is staggering.
To overcome them, we need to redefine how we think about preparedness, moving from a reactive position to a more proactive approach.
Money earmarked for preparedness must be allocated at levels sufficient to have the required impact.
Limitations on how it can be spent should be loosened.
Funding sources must be opened to allow for multi-year commitments.
Health-care providers and first responders must receive proper training.
And long-term solutions such as establishing and connecting bio-surveillance systems should be expanded and strengthened, to enable public-health professionals around the world to track and report human and animal diseases and plan defenses together.
Public health is an essential element of global security.
Failing to invest appropriately in prevention of infectious-disease outbreaks puts all of us at risk, whenever or wherever the next one occurs.
The Global Economy’s Surprising Resilience
LONDON – Disconcerting political developments in the United States and the United Kingdom might lead one to conclude that an already challenged world economy will struggle even more in the near term.
But as we continue into 2017, the cyclical evidence actually suggests otherwise.
Since my days as Chief Economist at Goldman Sachs, I have kept an eye on six indicators from around the world that, taken together, provide a reliable snapshot of what the global economy will look like for the next six months.
Right now, all six indicators show more promise than they have for some time, and only one of them has fallen slightly from a recent high.
The first indicator is weekly unemployment claims in the US, from which one can gauge the overall strength of the US economy.
Economists are rightly trained to treat unemployment as a lagging indicator, but these data can also be useful in forecasting the near future.
US jobless claims are always up to date, because they are produced weekly, and statistical evidence suggests that they are a leading indicator for US equity prices.
As of last week, jobless claims remained rather low, as they have for some time, which bodes well for US stock markets.
Similarly, the Institute for Supply Management Manufacturing Index provides a pretty good preview of the US economy for the next 3-6 months, even though manufacturing comprises a relatively small share of GDP.
Like the latest jobless claims, the ISM’s numbers are currently giving cause for optimism.
A third indicator is a subcomponent of the same ISM survey: manufacturers’ new orders and inventories.
Currently, new orders are increasing and inventories are low, which suggests that businesses will have to produce more in the coming months to satisfy those orders.
Looking beyond the US, a fourth indicator is the ratio of Chinese retail spending relative to industrial production (adjusted for inflation).
These figures give us a glimpse of both cyclical trends and China’s structural rebalancing away from exports and toward domestic consumption.
This will arguably be one of the most important indicators for both China and the rest of the global economy for years to come.
The ratio of Chinese monthly retail sales to industrial production, while erratic, has been slowly trending higher since 2008, and there appears to have been another uptick in consumption recently.
This is why I am less worried than others about frequently cited risks confronting the Chinese economy.
Chinese consumer spending has remained strong despite the slowdown in industrial output and investment and the government’s efforts to constrain spending on luxury goods.
Some might object that Chinese data cannot be trusted.
But I do not see why the data on one side of the ratio would be any more or less reliable than data on the other side.
Why would Chinese officials fiddle with consumption data while allowing the industrial-output figures to register a decline.
In any case, we have to work with what we have.
A fifth indicator is South Korean trade data, which is consistently reported on the first day of each month after trades occur – faster than any other country.
South Korea has an open economy and trading partners around the world, including the US, China, Japan, and the European Union, so one can extrapolate from its trade data to draw conclusions about the state of global trade.
After trending down in recent years, South Korean trade since November has shown signs of recovering, notably in terms of export growth; and in January, it bounced back significantly.
To be sure, this finding is at odds with all of the eulogies for globalization that one hears these days, and Donald Trump’s decidedly protectionist administration in the US could now send global trade into a long retreat.
But South Korea’s recent data suggest that globalization still has some life left in it, and that 2017 is off to a decent start.
In fact, barring the worst-case scenario under Trump, it is possible that the slowdown in global trade in recent years will turn out to be a temporary phenomenon.
It may have been a singular occurrence that reflected a variety of factors, including the euro crisis; continued economic weakness in many European countries; the sharp decline in commodity prices; dramatic slowdowns in Brazil, Russia, and other emerging economies; and tighter regulations for international banks, which might have hindered trade finance.
The last key indicator is the monthly Ifo Business Climate Index in Germany, which contains useful cyclical data for Europe overall, owing to Germany’s centrality in the continent’s economy.
The Ifo survey has reported positive results in recent months, although the data were more promising in December than in January.
Taken together, these six indicators suggest to me that the global economy might now be growing at a rate of more than 4%.
This is the fastest growth in a number of years – although the last decade’s average growth rate of 3.3% was barely lower than the rate in the previous decade – and close to the pace of the previous two decades before that.
At the same time, the six indicators cannot tell us anything about what will happen after the next few months.
It is an open question whether global economic growth will remain strong, strengthen further, or start to weaken.
It has been interesting to watch growth accelerate in the face of shocks such as the UK’s Brexit referendum and Trump’s election.
And yet it is unclear why this is happening.
Some might say the trend is a result of policy decisions in the US and the UK, but far more would probably say that it is happening despite those decisions.
Unfortunately, there are no indicators that provide an answer to this question – only time will tell.
Three Scenarios for the Global Economy
NEW YORK – For the last few years, the global economy has been oscillating between periods of acceleration (when growth is positive and strengthening) and periods of deceleration (when growth is positive but weakening).
After over a year of acceleration, is the world headed toward another slowdown, or will the recovery persist?
The current upswing in growth and equity markets has been going strong since the summer of 2016.
Despite a brief hiccup after the Brexit vote, the acceleration endured not just Donald Trump’s election as US president, but also the heightening policy uncertainty and geopolitical chaos that he has generated.
In response to this apparent resilience, the International Monetary Fund, which in recent years had characterized global growth as the “new mediocre,” recently upgraded its World Economic Outlook.
Will the recent growth spurt continue over the next few years?
Or is the world experiencing a temporary cyclical upswing that will soon be subdued by new tail risks, like those that have triggered other slowdowns in recent years?
It is enough to recall the summer of 2015 and early 2016, when investor fears of a Chinese hard landing, an excessively fast exit from zero policy rates by the US Federal Reserve, a stall in US GDP growth, and low oil prices conspired to undercut growth.
One can envision three possible scenarios for the global economy in the next three years or so.
In the bullish scenario, the world’s four largest, systemically important economies – China, the eurozone, Japan, and the United States – implement structural reforms that boost potential growth and address financial vulnerabilities.
By ensuring that the cyclical upswing is associated with stronger potential and actual growth, such efforts would produce robust GDP growth, low but moderately rising inflation, and relative financial stability for many more years.
US and global equity markets would reach new heights, justified by stronger fundamentals.
In the bearish scenario, the opposite happens: the world’s major economies fail to implement structural reforms that boost potential growth.
Rather than using this month’s National Congress of the Communist Party as a catalyst for reform, China kicks the can down the road, continuing on a path of excessive leverage and overcapacity.
The eurozone fails to achieve greater integration, while political constraints limit national policymakers’ ability to implement growth-enhancing structural reforms.
And Japan remains stuck on its low-growth trajectory, as supply-side reforms and trade liberalization – the third “arrow” of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s economic strategy – fizzle out.
As for the US, the Trump administration, in this scenario, continues to pursue a policy approach – including a tax cut that overwhelmingly favors the rich, trade protectionism, and migration restrictions – that may well reduce potential growth.
Excessive fiscal stimulus leads to runaway deficits and debt, which results in higher interest rates and a stronger dollar, further weakening growth.
Trigger-happy Trump could even end up in a military conflict with North Korea – and, later, Iran – diminishing America’s economic prospects further.
In this scenario, the lack of reform in major economies will leave the cyclical upswing constrained by low trend growth.
If potential growth remains low, easy monetary and credit policies could eventually lead to goods and/or asset inflation, eventually causing an economic slowdown – and possibly an outright recession and financial crisis – when asset bubbles burst or inflation rises.
The third – and, in my view, most likely – scenario lies somewhere between the first two.
The cyclical upswing, in both growth and equity markets, continues for a while, driven by the remaining tailwinds.
Yet, while major economies pursue some structural reforms to improve potential growth, the pace of change is much slower, and its scope more modest, than is needed to maximize potential.
In China, this muddle-through scenario means doing just enough to avoid a hard landing, but not enough to achieve a truly soft one; with financial vulnerabilities left unaddressed, distress becomes all but inevitable over time.
In the eurozone, this scenario would entail only nominal progress toward greater integration, with Germany’s continued rejection of true risk-sharing or fiscal union weakening incentives for struggling member countries to undertake tough reforms.
In Japan, an increasingly ineffective Abe administration would implement minimal reforms, leaving potential growth stuck below 1%.
In the US, Trump’s presidency would remain volatile and ineffective, with a growing number of Americans realizing that, despite his populist pretense, Trump is merely a plutocrat protecting the interests of the rich.
Inequality rises; the middle class stagnates; wages barely grow; and consumption and growth remain anemic, at barely close to 2%.
But the risks of muddling through extend far beyond mediocre economic performance.
This scenario represents not a stable equilibrium, but an unstable disequilibrium, vulnerable to economic, financial, and geopolitical shocks.
When such shocks eventually emerge, the economy will be tipped into a slowdown or, if the shock is large enough, even recession and financial crisis.
In other words, if the world does simply muddle through, as seems likely, it could, within three or four years, face a more bearish outlook.
The lesson is clear: either political leaders and policymakers demonstrate the leadership needed to secure a better medium-term outlook, or downside risks will materialize before long – and do serious damage to the global economy.
Good Times at Last?
LONDON – In February 2017, I wrote an optimistic commentary called “The Global Economy’s Surprising Resilience.”
The piece came as a surprise to those who saw only bleak prospects for Western countries, not least the United States, where US President Donald Trump had just been inaugurated.
Now, nearly a year later, my three decades of experience in global financial markets leads me to believe that the economic situation is not quite as straightforward.
On the positive side, the half-dozen cyclical indicators I listed last February remain strong, and some have even strengthened further.
One key indicator is South Korea’s monthly trade data.
The country’s exports grew by 15.8% in 2017, the largest increase since 1956, when it began reporting these data.
Moreover, export growth occurred even as Trump threatened to withdraw from the US-Korea Free Trade Agreement and stoked tensions with North Korea – a powerful rebuke to those who have predicted retrenchment of global trade.
As I suspected a year ago, the slowdown in global trade in past years probably stemmed from the euro crisis and falling commodity prices, and would thus prove temporary.
Now that those two events are behind us, global trade appears to have picked up.
Of course, much will depend on whether trade momentum can be maintained.
Although South Korea’s export performance in December was impressive, it fell slightly short of forecasters’ expectations.
We will have to wait and see if it remains strong in 2018.
Another key cyclical indicator is reflected in monthly Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) surveys for manufacturing and services, which include underlying sub-indices for inventories and sales.
Here, the news is remarkable: PMI survey results in many countries around the world are the strongest they have been in years.
That includes the US, where I have found the Institute of Supply Management’s manufacturing index to be consistently accurate and indicative of underlying realities.
It also includes the eurozone, where PMI-survey data have reached their highest levels since before 2000.
Even the United Kingdom’s monthly PMI surveys are showing momentum, though not as much as in other Western countries, most likely owing to the Brexit effect.
If the global economic environment continues to improve, the UK might luck out in its timing for withdrawing from the European Union, notwithstanding the growth-weakening effects that Brexit will surely have.
Crucially, key indicators for China are looking good, too, particularly in terms of long-term growth in services and domestic consumption.
I continue to believe that these two factors will prove immensely consequential not just for China, but for the rest of the world as well.
Many countries want to export more than just commodities and manufacturing inputs to China, and companies around the world are jockeying for access to China’s massive domestic market.
All told, forecasts projecting global GDP growth of 4% or more for 2018 seem credible.
I would not be surprised to see sell-side forecasters lifting their numbers even further in the next two months.
The International Monetary Fund almost certainly will at its annual spring meeting, if not sooner.
So, what’s not to like in the global economic picture for 2018?
For starters, as a veteran of financial markets, I am usually wary of a strong consensus.
While many oft-cited concerns in 2017 turned out to be unwarranted, that doesn’t mean economic risks have disappeared.
In contrast to a year ago, people are increasingly acknowledging that the global economy is stronger than they had thought.
But if growth continues to accelerate, the US Federal Reserve might end up hiking interest rates more than markets anticipated.
And the other major central banks, particularly the People’s Bank of China, the European Central Bank, and the Bank of Japan, might reverse their exceptionally loose monetary policies.
To be sure, if the global economy is truly returning to relatively high and stable growth, monetary-policy tightening need not be harmful – and may even be less harmful than waiting for stronger evidence of inflation to emerge.
Nevertheless, the world’s major economies have enjoyed remarkably generous monetary policies for a decade – and for far longer in Japan’s case.
At the end of the day, no one really knows what the consequences of higher interest rates will be.
For my part, I suspect that productivity growth will accelerate in a number of places, which would justify monetary-policy adjustments and make rising interest rates more tolerable.
But that is just a hunch, based on my reading of tentative wage and productivity data in the UK and the US, among other places.
One final concern is that, while not having gone full circle, the global mood has shifted from fear about political risks to obliviousness, even though many such risks still loom large.
The potential fallout from poor US leadership in the Middle East and on the Korean Peninsula cannot be ignored; nor can the long-term challenges still confronting Europe.
I have long believed that, at least for financial investors, it is better for everyone to be worried about everything than for a small minority to be worried on everyone else’s behalf.
Still, and more important, as long as financial conditions don’t tighten excessively as a result of today’s cyclical strengthening, global economic performance for the rest of this decade could end up being more robust than anyone would have imagined just a few years ago.
The Economic View from the Alps
LONDON – I recently took a trip to Switzerland – a remarkable country that I have been fortunate to visit many times over the past 40 years.
In addition to having a good time, I found a Swiss perspective useful to reflect on the state of the world and its economic vitality.
Aside from its wealth – or perhaps because of it – Switzerland has always struck me as a happy country.
While spending some time in Zurich in 1994, I first experienced the joy of swimming in the city’s river and lake.
And nowadays, it is common to see people doing this in many other urban areas, including Basel, where contented souls enjoy the mighty Rhine.
I recently overheard two Swiss speakers teasing each other about whether the swimming is better in Zurich, Basel, or the capital, Bern, with its fast-flowing white waters.
Where else in the developed world can one enjoy such accessible pleasures?
I used to find it amusing that so many Germans regard Switzerland as their ideal country; as I have grown older, I have come to understand what they mean.
Another reason to admire Switzerland is its astonishing railway system, which crisscrosses every nook and cranny of the country.
On this occasion, we traveled by train to the Bernese Highlands (Berner Oberland), just as I had done nearly 40 years ago.
As we made our precisely timed connections with ease, I wondered why so many other Western governments have deemed the public sector to be incapable of running an efficient railway system. The Swiss system is a testament to how public expenditures and administration can benefit all of a country’s citizens.
As someone who was deeply involved in the British government’s “northern powerhouse” project, I take the Swiss example to heart.
It further bolsters my belief that the United Kingdom should make state-of-the-art railways a priority, especially in the north, to connect Manchester, Leeds, Liverpool, Sheffield, Newcastle, and their surrounding areas.
Of course, in other ways, Swiss and British economic experience is nothing alike.
In recent years, the Swiss franc has appreciated significantly against almost every other currency.
For Britons, there are better ways to pass the time than to calculate the pittance that a pound now buys in Switzerland, and I was not surprised to see so few others on my trip.
I did, however, see plenty of visitors from Asian countries at some of the Alps’ most beautiful sites.
This reminded me of my very first trip to Switzerland, as a student traveling on an Interrail card, when I saw Japanese tourists lined up to board the mountain train at Kleine Scheidegg. They were making the exciting climb up to the Jungfrau and the highest mountain station in Europe, and I seem to remember that they had their own carriage, perhaps to aid with translation.
Back then, Japan was supposedly about to overtake the United States to become the world’s largest economy.
But within a decade, its asset-price bubble had burst, and its economy had essentially flat-lined in nominal terms.
These days, it is China that will supposedly overtake the US; and, as it happens, that same Kleine Scheidegg station platform now has a carriage reserved for Chinese tourists.
And yet there are still plenty of Japanese tourists in Switzerland, too; and in Grindelwald, one of the Bernese Highlands’s many picturesque villages, there is even a Japanese-language information center.
This reveals a less-appreciated side of the Japanese economic story.
Adjusting for Japan’s declining workforce shows that in terms of per capita GDP, Japan has actually performed just as well as many other advanced economies in recent years.
Moreover, recent data indicate that Japan may be embarking on a strong, domestically driven economic expansion.
In the second quarter of this year, its growth rate was among the best in the G7.
Given these trends, I suspect that Switzerland will continue to host plenty of Japanese tourists in the coming years.
And if China, with its population of 1.4 billion people, maintains its economic trajectory of the last 20 years, the Swiss will probably have to build a new, much larger station at Kleine Scheidegg.
Of course, China could also fall short of its aspirations, as its persistently bearish skeptics have predicted.
But while in Switzerland, I couldn’t help but think that the constant talk of China exaggerating its official economic data has become a farce.
To appreciate China’s rise, one need only look at all the Chinese tourists in the Bernese Highlands and many other places.
To be sure, the Chinese economic miracle will end at some point. But that time has not yet come.
On the contrary, my trip provided ample anecdotal evidence in support of the data showing a strong global recovery in 2017.
That recovery is real, and it will most likely continue to broaden and include more countries – at least for now.
The West’s Broken Promises on Education Aid
NEW YORK – The Global Partnership for Education, a worthy and capable initiative to promote education in 65 low-income countries, is having what the jargon of development assistance calls a “replenishment round,” meaning that it is asking donor governments to refill its coffers.
Yet the fact that the GPE is begging for mere crumbs – a mere $1 billion per year – exposes the charade of Western governments’ commitment to the global Education for All agenda.
The United States and the European Union have never cared that much about that agenda.
When it comes to disease, they have at times been willing to invest to slow or stop epidemics like AIDS, malaria, and Ebola, both to save lives and to prevent the diseases from coming to their own countries.
But when it comes to education, many countries in the West are more interested in building walls and detention camps than schools.
The GPE does excellent work promoting primary education around the world.
Donor countries, all of which long ago signed on to Education for All, should be clamoring to help one of the world’s most effective organizations to achieve that goal.
Yet generous donors are few and far between.
This reality extends back to imperial times.
When most of Africa and much of Asia were under European rule, the colonizers invested little in basic education.
As late as 1950, according to United Nations data, illiteracy was pervasive in Europe’s African and Asian colonies.
At the time of independence from Britain, India’s illiteracy rate stood at 80-85%, roughly the same as Indonesia’s illiteracy rate at the time of independence from the Netherlands.
In French West Africa, the illiteracy rate in 1950 stood at 95-99%.
After independence, African and Asian countries pursued massive and largely successful initiatives to raise basic education and literacy.
Yet, far from seizing this opportunity to make up for lost time, Europe and the US have provided consistently meager assistance for primary and secondary education, even as they have made high-profile commitments such as Education for All and Sustainable Development Goal 4, which calls for universal access to pre-primary through secondary school.
Consider the grim data on development aid for education, which has stagnated for years – and actually declined between 2010 and 2015.
According to the most recent OECD data, total donor aid for primary and secondary education in Africa amounted to just $1.3 billion in 2016.
To put that figure in perspective, the US Pentagon budget is roughly $2 billion per day.
With around 420 million African kids of school age, total aid amounted to roughly $3 per child per year.
It’s not as if Western governments don’t know that far more is needed. Several detailed recent calculations provide credible estimates of how much external financing developing countries will need to achieve SDG 4.
A UNESCO study puts the total at $39.5 billion per year.
A report by the International Commission on Financing Education Opportunity, led by former UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown, similarly put developing countries’ external financing needs at tens of billions of dollars per year.
Here is the reason why aid is needed.
A year of education in Africa requires at least $300 per student. (Note that the rich countries spend several thousand dollars per student per year.)
With Africa’s school-age population accounting for roughly one-third of the total, the per capita financing requirement is about $100.
Yet for a typical African country, that’s about 10% of per capita national income – far more than the education budget can cover.
External aid can and should cover the financing gap so that all children can attend school.
That’s not happening.
Annual spending per school-aged child in Sub-Saharan Africa is roughly one-third of the minimum needed.
As a result, most kids don’t come anywhere close to finishing secondary school.
They are forced to drop out early, because there are no openings in public schools and tuition for private school is far too high for most families.
Girls are especially likely to leave school early, though parents know that all of their children need and deserve a quality education.
Without the skills that a secondary education provides, the children who leave school early are condemned to poverty.
Many eventually try to migrate to Europe in desperate search of a livelihood.
Some drown on the way; others are caught by European patrols and returned to Africa.
So now comes the GPE’s replenishment round, scheduled for early February in Senegal.
The GPE should be receiving at least $10 billion a year (about four days’ military spending by the NATO countries) to put Africa on a path toward universal secondary education.
Instead, the GPE is reportedly still begging donors for less than $1 billion per year to cover GPE programs all over the world.
Instead of actually solving the education crisis, rich-country leaders go from speech to speech, meeting to meeting, proclaiming their ardent love of education for all.
Across Africa, political, religious, and civil-society leaders are doing what they can.
Ghana has recently announced free upper-secondary education for all, setting the pace for the continent.
As African countries struggle to fund their ambitious commitments, new partners, including private companies and high-net-worth individuals, should step forward to help them.
Traditional donors, for their part, have decades of lost time to make up for.
The quest for education will not be stopped, but history will judge harshly those who turn their backs on children in need.
Financial Investors’ Wish List for 2018
NEWPORT BEACH – If financial investors were to write letters to Santa Claus this Christmas, they would probably be tempted to ask for the continuation of the unusual combination of factors that has dominated over the last year: ultra-low market volatility, booming financial-asset values, correlations that lower the cost of portfolio risk mitigation, and promising new opportunities (such as Bitcoin).
But before making their wish list, investors should consider the longer-term risks associated with the decoupling of financial markets from economic and policy fundamentals.
Investors could be forgiven for hoping for more of the same.
After all, with less than a month to go, 2017 is on course to be a hugely, if not historically rewarding year for them.
As of December 12, global stock markets, and in particular the S&P index, had returned around 20% for the year – and this on top of an already-strong multi-year run.
Add to that unusually low volatility – in the US, 2017 so far has shown the lowest daily loss in the entire history of the S&P 500 index – and there has been little to keep investors up at night.
Usually, such strong stock returns are accompanied by lower prices for government bonds – the so-called negative correlation between risky and safe assets.
Not so in 2017.
Despite the impressive equity rally, the price of longer-term US Treasury bills was higher at the beginning of December than at the start of the year.
And then there is the precipitous rise of the crypto-currency Bitcoin.
With its price having surged by an eye-popping amount this year (from around $1,000 to over $16,000 as of December 12), even a small allocation of Bitcoin has made a material difference in investors’ portfolios.
Five main factors have enabled this unusual situation.
·         A synchronized pickup in global economic growth, which continues to strengthen.
·         Progress in the United States on pro-growth policies.
·         Skillful normalization of monetary policy (which is still ongoing) by the US Federal Reserve.
·         Passive investment products attracting large inflows.
·         Continued large liquidity injections from three big central banks – the Bank of Japan (BOJ), the European Central Bank (ECB), the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) – which, together with cash-rich corporate balance sheets, have served to lower funding costs for a significant set of households and corporates.
Now for the less exuberant news: without continued economic and policy improvements, the factors that have delighted investors in 2017 risk generating an unpleasant reversal of fortune.
This year’s strong performance has, after all, been buoyed significantly by “borrowed” returns from future years.
With regard to mitigating portfolio risk, the increase in government bond prices leaves little room for this traditionally safe asset to compensate for a possible decline in stocks.
Given how many value-at-risk-based models work, the persistence of low volatility has resulted in a crowded trade in a number of areas, which could turn out to be technically fragile.
As for Bitcoin, its vertiginous rise – fueled in part by the growing participation of institutional investors – may imply that it is on the path toward broad acceptance.
But it may also turn out to be little more than a large financial bubble, implying serious damage when it inevitably collapses.
What, then, should investors really be hoping for in the coming year?
In general, the top priority must be improvement in economic and policy fundamentals to the point that they better validate existing elevated asset prices, while laying a foundation for greater gains over time.
Achieving this would require, in the US, the expansion of pro-growth policies, which, as recently announced by Donald Trump’s administration, would include adding an infrastructure plan to deregulation and tax measures.
European countries should also pursue more focused pro-growth measures at the national level, while supporting stronger regional efforts, facilitated by a reinvigorated reform-minded Franco-German leadership and a relatively orderly Brexit process.
As for Japan, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe should take advantage of his commanding majority in the Diet, won in October’s snap general election, to implement the third “arrow” of Abenomics: pro-growth structural reforms.
Finally, to promote stable growth, all of the world’s systemically important central banks – notably, the Fed, the BOJ, the ECB, and the PBOC – would need to continue coordinating their strategies, with a view to ensuring consistent monetary-policy stances.
Only with such efforts can the current pickup in global growth develop the structural roots that are needed to make it durable, balanced, and inclusive over the medium term.
This is all the more critical at a time of fluid geopolitical risk and uncertain productivity, wage, and inflation dynamics.
However tempting it may be to focus our holiday wishes on our own immediate desires, it is imperative this year that investors’ wish lists take into account the big economic and policy picture.
A Year of Successes in Global Health
BANGKOK – In the field of human development, the year that just ended was better than many predicted it would be.
A decade after the Great Recession began, economic recovery continued in 2017, and progress was made on issues like poverty, education, and global warming.
But perhaps the most significant achievements of the last 12 months were in global health.
I count 18 unique successes in 2017, many of which will help sow the seeds of progress for the months and years ahead.
The first notable success occurred early in the year, when a Guinness World Record was set for the most donations of medication made during a 24-hour period.
On January 30, more than 207 million drug doses were donated to treat neglected tropical diseases including guinea-worm disease, leprosy, and trachoma.
This extraordinary feat was made possible by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and by pharmaceutical firms including Bayer, Novartis, Pfizer, and my company, Sanofi Pasteur.
India’s elimination of active trachoma was another milestone, as it marked an important turning point in the global fight against a leading infectious cause of blindness.
Last year, trachoma was also eliminated in Mexico, Cambodia, and the Lao People’s Democratic Republic.
A third key health trend in 2017 was further progress toward the elimination of human onchocerciasis, which causes blindness, impaired vision, and skin infections.
Fourth on my list is a dramatic drop in the number of guinea-worm disease infections.
A mere 26 cases were recorded worldwide in 2017, down from 3.5 million cases in 1986.
Efforts to eradicate leprosy earned the fifth spot on my list, while vaccine advances in general were sixth.
Highlights included a new typhoid vaccine, shown to improve protection for infants and young children, and a new shingles vaccine.
Number seven is the dramatic progress made in eliminating measles.
Four countries – Bhutan, the Maldives, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom – were all declared measles-free last year.
The war on Zika is number eight on my list of health achievements in 2017.
Thanks to coordinated global efforts, most people in Latin America and the Caribbean are now immune to the mosquito-borne virus, and experts believe transmission will continue to slow.
Number nine is polio eradication.
Fewer than 20 new cases were reported globally, a 99% reduction since 1988.
Although the year ended with reports of cases in Pakistan, health experts remain optimistic that polio can be fully eradicated in 2018.
Rounding out my top ten was the creation of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), which was established to develop vaccines for infectious disease threats.
Launched with nearly $600 million in funding from Germany, Japan, Norway, the UK charity Wellcome Trust, and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, CEPI aims to reduce sharply the time it takes to develop and produce vaccines.
Huge gains in disease control and prevention were made last year, and the next few items on my list (11 through 16) reflect progress on specific illnesses.
For example, rates of premature death fell for non-communicable diseases like cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, and chronic respiratory conditions.
Another highlight was the historic approval of a sophisticated cancer treatment, CAR T-cell therapy, which uses a patient’s own immune cells to attack tumors.
Improvements were also made in treating HIV.
Clinical trials for an HIV vaccine started at the end of 2017, while doctors in South Africa reported curing a young boy of the disease after he received treatments as an infant.
These and other initiatives give new hope to the many who are still suffering from this chronic condition.
Advances in treating gonorrhea, a common sexually transmitted infection that has become increasingly resistant to antibiotics, are also worthy of mention.
Wrapping up my list of disease-specific gains of 2017 is the renewed commitment made by global health ministers to eradicate tuberculosis by 2030.
The final two successes are reminders of how much work remains.
In August, the fast food giant McDonald’s unveiled a Global Vision for Antimicrobial Stewardship in Food Animals.
Although recognition of the food industry’s ethical responsibilities for public health is to be welcomed, the pledge also represents a cautionary note about how closely connected food and health really are.
Finally, rounding out my list was the historic Universal Health Coverage Forum held in Tokyo, where global leaders gathered to discuss how to improve health-care access.
The World Bank and the WHO note that half of the world’s population still cannot obtain essential health services.
I therefore count the December meeting as a “success” not for its achievements, but because it was a reminder to the international community that improving health-care access remains a long-term endeavor.
As the global health community resets its annual clock – and I begin cataloguing the big health stories of 2018 – we should take a moment to reflect on the 12 months recently ended.
Even in a mediocre year, the global health community saved millions of lives.
Imagine what we will achieve in an extraordinary year.
The Two Backlashes Against Globalization
NEW DELHI – When I left India for graduate school in the United States in 1975, the word “globalization” was not in use anywhere in the world.
Back then, crossing borders was still a big deal, and getting a US visa was no easy feat.
When I did arrive in America, to be an Indian still carried a whiff of the exotic and the unfamiliar.
Nowadays, globalization is inescapable.
Over the course of less than three decades, trade barriers came down, and the combination of accessible airplane travel, satellite television, and the Internet has created a kind of interconnected “global village.”
But two types of backlash are now casting doubt on globalization’s future.
The 2008 economic crisis seems to have been the turning point in public perception.
In the years leading up to the crisis, millions of people rose out of poverty, and democracy became more widespread than ever, creating the general sense that a golden age had begun.
Francis Fukuyama famously argued that in the grand global struggle over the future of human political and economic organization, the forces of democracy and liberal capitalism had won a definitive victory.
Then crisis struck, and the hubris of that era was quickly discredited.
People began to note a distinct and deepening disparity between globalization’s winners and losers, with weak wage growth accompanied by robust returns for the wealthy.
In the United Kingdom, for example, wages have grown by only 13% since 2008, but the stock market is up by 115%.
According to an annual Credit Suisse report, wealth inequality is now growing sharply in 35 of 46 major economies, compared to just 12 before 2007.
In the developed world, the poor and the unemployed began to feel that they had no stake in the globalized system.
They condemned the political establishment for pursuing policies that sent their jobs to faraway lands like China and India.
And they demanded a return to the old economic order, and thus to the promise that each new generation would earn more and live better than the last.
But the backlash against economic globalization is only half of the story.
There has also been a backlash against cultural globalization – encompassing cosmopolitanism, multiculturalism, and secularism – driven by those who seek the comforts of traditional ethnic, religious, or national identity.
This identity-focused backlash is exemplified by US President Donald Trump, whose slogan, “Make America Great Again,” was code for “Make America White Again” – a message that appealed to the unemployed, bitter, and increasingly xenophobic white blue-collar voters that formed the core of Trump’s base.
But the America that Trump promised isn’t coming back: by 2030, a majority of the American labor force will be non-white.
While Trump is often viewed as a uniquely American phenomenon, he is actually just one part of a broader revolt by nationalists and traditionalists against a liberal globalist and cosmopolitan elite, in the name of a more religiously and culturally rooted identity.
Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, and, in his own way, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi are all capitalizing on this trend.
Even in places where far-right, xenophobic, and nationalist parties and politicians have not won power, they have made strides, as the Alternative für Deutschland did in Germany’s recent federal election.
Yet the resentment toward the so-called elites into which such leaders have tapped can be seen on the left as well.
Consider the Occupy Wall Street movement in the US, which comprised young people claiming to represent the 99% who were left behind as the 1% continued to thrive.
The Democratic Party insurgency, led by Senator Bernie Sanders, opposed Hillary Clinton for much the same reason their right-wing counterparts did: with her well-paid speeches at Goldman Sachs, she was viewed as a representative of the Wall Street-linked globalized elite.
Similar anti-elite sentiment, fueled partly by working-class resentment of cosmopolitanism and economic inequality, underpinned the United Kingdom’s vote to leave the European Union.
There are now 1,800 billionaires globally, 70 of whom live in wealthy and cosmopolitan London, where residents overwhelmingly opposed Brexit.
But opposition to the EU was compounded by more fundamental issues of nationalism and identity, including citizens’ distaste for the large numbers of non-English-speaking immigrants from other member countries.
The economic and cultural backlashes against globalization do not always overlap.
While Erdoğan and Modi, like Xi Jinping in China, promise national reassertion, they are still economic globalizers – the “Davos Man” who has come to represent the global elite.
But the current specter of economic uncertainty is now reinforcing their nativism and chauvinism, just when similar tendencies are on the rise in the West.
Taken together, the two types of backlash against globalization explain why protectionist barriers to the free flow of goods, capital, and labor have been erected even in developed Western countries that long advocated greater openness.
In 2007, global capital flows reached a record high of $12.4 trillion, or 21% of the global economy.
By 2016 the annual total had plummeted to $4.3 trillion, or 6% of the global economy – a lower share than in 1980.
With total economic growth outpacing world trade growth of less than 2.5%, globalization has been rolled back decades.
Yet, while globalization isn’t perfect, it has pulled millions out of poverty in developing countries like China and India, created new markets for goods made by poor countries, and reduced prices for rich-country consumers.
The economic and cultural backlash must be resisted, and the promise of global integration realized for all.
The Globalization of Our Discontent
NEW YORK – Fifteen years ago, I published Globalization and Its Discontents, a book that sought to explain why there was so much dissatisfaction with globalization within the developing countries.
Quite simply, many believed that the system was “rigged” against them, and global trade agreements were singled out for being particularly unfair.
Now discontent with globalization has fueled a wave of populism in the United States and other advanced economies, led by politicians who claim that the system is unfair to their countries.
In the US, President Donald Trump insists that America’s trade negotiators were snookered by those from Mexico and China.
So how could something that was supposed to benefit all, in developed and developing countries alike, now be reviled almost everywhere?
How can a trade agreement be unfair to all parties?
To those in developing countries, Trump’s claims – like Trump himself – are laughable.
The US basically wrote the rules and created the institutions of globalization.
In some of these institutions – for example, the International Monetary Fund – the US still has veto power, despite America’s diminished role in the global economy (a role which Trump seems determined to diminish still further).
To someone like me, who has watched trade negotiations closely for more than a quarter-century, it is clear that US trade negotiators got most of what they wanted.
The problem was with what they wanted.
Their agenda was set, behind closed doors, by corporations.
It was an agenda written by and for large multinational companies, at the expense of workers and ordinary citizens everywhere.
Indeed, it often seems that workers, who have seen their wages fall and jobs disappear, are just collateral damage – innocent but unavoidable victims in the inexorable march of economic progress.
But there is another interpretation of what has happened: one of the objectives of globalization was to weaken workers’ bargaining power.
What corporations wanted was cheaper labor, however they could get it.
This interpretation helps explain some puzzling aspects of trade agreements.
Why is it, for example, that advanced countries gave away one of their biggest advantages, the rule of law?
Indeed, provisions embedded in most recent trade agreements give foreign investors more rights than are provided to investors in the US.
They are compensated, for example, should the government adopt a regulation that hurts their bottom line, no matter how desirable the regulation or how great the harm caused by the corporation in its absence.
There are three responses to globalized discontent with globalization.
The first – call it the Las Vegas strategy – is to double down on the bet on globalization as it has been managed for the past quarter-century.
This bet, like all bets on proven policy failures (such as trickle-down economics) is based on the hope that somehow it will succeed in the future.
The second response is Trumpism: cut oneself off from globalization, in the hope that doing so will somehow bring back a bygone world.
But protectionism won’t work. Globally, manufacturing jobs are on the decline, simply because productivity growth has outpaced growth in demand.
Even if manufacturing were to come back, the jobs won’t.
Advanced manufacturing technology, including robots, means that the few jobs created will require higher skills and will be placed at different locations than the jobs that were lost.
Like doubling down, this approach is doomed to fail, further increasing the discontent felt by those left behind.
Trump will fail even in his proclaimed goal of reducing the trade deficit, which is determined by the disparity between domestic savings and investment.
Now that the Republicans have gotten their way and enacted a tax cut for billionaires, national savings will fall and the trade deficit will rise, owing to an increase in the value of the dollar. (Fiscal deficits and trade deficits normally move so closely together that they are called “twin” deficits.)
Trump may not like it, but as he is slowly finding out, there are some things that even a person in the most powerful position in the world cannot control.
There is a third approach: social protection without protectionism, the kind of approach that the small Nordic countries took. They knew that as small countries they had to remain open.
But they also knew that remaining open would expose workers to risk. Thus, they had to have a social contract that helped workers move from old jobs to new and provide some help in the interim.
The Nordic countries are deeply democratic societies, so they knew that unless most workers regarded globalization as benefiting them, it wouldn’t be sustained.
And the wealthy in these countries recognized that if globalization worked as it should, there would be enough benefits to go around.
American capitalism in recent years has been marked by unbridled greed – the 2008 financial crisis provides ample confirmation of that.
But, as some countries have shown, a market economy can take forms that temper the excesses of both capitalism and globalization, and deliver more sustainable growth and higher standards of living for most citizens.
We can learn from such successes what to do, just as we can learn from past mistakes what not to do.
As has become evident, if we do not manage globalization so that it benefits all, the backlash – from the New Discontents in the North and the Old Discontents in the South – is at risk of intensifying.
Globalization’s Political Fault Lines
NEW YORK – The United Kingdom’s narrow vote to leave the European Union had specific British causes.
And yet it is also the proverbial canary in the coalmine, signaling a broad populist/nationalist backlash – at least in advanced economies – against globalization, free trade, offshoring, labor migration, market-oriented policies, supranational authorities, and even technological change.
All of these trends reduce wages and employment for low-skill workers in labor-scarce and capital-rich advanced economies, and raise them in labor-abundant emerging economies.
Consumers in advanced economies benefit from the reduction in prices of traded goods; but low and even some medium-skill workers lose income as their equilibrium wages fall and their jobs are threatened.
In the “Brexit” vote, the fault lines were clear: rich versus poor, gainers versus losers from trade/globalization, skilled versus unskilled, educated versus less educated, young versus old, urban versus rural, and diverse versus more homogenous communities.
The same fault lines are appearing in other advanced economies, including the United States and continental Europe.
With their more flexible economies and labor markets, the US and the UK have recovered more strongly than continental Europe in terms of GDP and employment since the 2008 global financial crisis.
Job creation has been robust, with the unemployment rate falling below 5%, even if real wages are not growing much.
Yet in the US, Donald Trump has become the hero of angry workers threatened by trade, migration, and technological change.
In the UK, the Brexit vote was heavily influenced by fear that immigrants from low-wage EU countries (the proverbial “Polish plumber”) were taking citizens’ jobs and public services.
In continental Europe and the eurozone, however, economic conditions are much worse.
The average unemployment rate hovers above 10% (and much higher in the eurozone periphery – more than 20% in Greece and Spain) with youth unemployment over 30%.
In most of these countries, job creation is anemic, real wages are falling, and dual labor markets mean that formal-sector, unionized workers have good wages and benefits, while younger workers have precarious jobs that pay lower wages, provide no employment security, and offer low or no benefits.
Politically, the strains of globalization are twofold.
First, establishment parties of the right and the left, which for more than a generation have supported free trade and globalization, are being challenged by populist, nativist/nationalist anti-establishment parties.
Second, establishment parties are being disrupted – if not destroyed – from within, as champions of anti-globalization emerge and challenge the mainstream orthodoxy.
Establishment parties were once controlled by globalization’s beneficiaries: capital owners; skilled, educated, and digitally savvy workers; urban and cosmopolitan elites; and unionized white- and blue-collar employees.
But they also included workers – both blue- and white-collar – who were among the losers from globalization, but who nonetheless remained loyal, either because they were socially and religiously conservative, or because center-left parties were formally supporters of unions, workers’ rights, and entitlement programs.
After the 2008 financial crisis, globalization’s losers started to organize and find anti-establishment champions on both the left and the right.
On the left, the losers in the UK and the US, especially young people, found champions in traditional center-left parties: Jeremy Corbyn in the UK’s Labour Party, and Bernie Sanders in America’s Democratic Party.
The deepest fault lines emerged among center-right parties.
These parties – the Republicans in the US, the Tories in the UK, and center-right parties across continental Europe – confronted an internal revolt against their own leaders.
The rise of Donald Trump – anti-trade, anti-migration, anti-Muslim, and nativist – is a reflection of an uncomfortable fact for the Republican establishment: the party’s median voter is closer to those who have lost from globalization.
A similar revolt took place in the UK’s Conservative Party, with globalization’s losers coalescing around the party’s “Leave” campaign or shifting allegiance to the populist anti-EU UK Independence Party.
In continental Europe, where multi-party parliamentary systems are prevalent, political fragmentation and disintegration are even more severe than in the UK and the US.
On the EU’s periphery, anti-establishment parties tend to be on the left: Syriza in Greece, Italy’s Five Star Movement, Spain’s Podemos, leftist parties in Portugal.
In the EU core, such parties tend to be on the right: Alternative for Germany, France’s National Front, and similar far-right parties in Austria, the Netherlands, Denmark, Finland, Sweden, and elsewhere.
But, despite the growing number, organization, and mobilization of globalization’s losers, globalization itself is not necessarily doomed.
For starters, it continues to yield net benefits for advanced and emerging markets alike, which is why the losers still tend to be a minority in most advanced economies, while those who benefit from globalization are a large – if at times silent – majority.
In fact, even the “losers” benefit from the lower prices of goods and services brought about by globalization and technological innovation.
This also why populist and anti-establishment parties are still a political minority.
Even Syriza, once in power, backpedaled and had to accept austerity, as an EU exit would have been much costlier.
And Spain’s recent general election, held three days after the Brexit referendum, suggests that, despite high unemployment, austerity, and painful structural reforms, moderate, pro-European forces remain a majority.
Even in the US, Trump’s appeal is limited, owing to the demographic narrowness of his electoral base. Whether he can win the presidential election in November is highly doubtful.
This is also why pro-European center-right and center-left coalitions remain in power in most of the EU.
The risk that anti-EU parties may come to power in Italy, France, and the Netherlands – among others – is rising, but still remains a distant possibility.
Finally, economic theory suggests that globalization can be made to benefit all as long as the winners compensate the losers.
This can take the form of direct compensation or greater provision of free or semi-free public goods (for example, education, retraining, health care, unemployment benefits, and portable pensions).
For workers to accept more labor mobility and flexibility as creative destruction eliminates some jobs and creates others, appropriate schemes are needed to replace income lost as a result of transitional unemployment.
In the continental EU, establishment parties remain in power partly because their countries maintain extensive social welfare systems.
The backlash against globalization is real and growing. But it can be contained and managed through policies that compensate workers for its collateral damage and costs.
Only by enacting such policies will globalization’s losers begin to think that they may eventually join the ranks of its winners.
Does Trade Fuel Inequality?
CAMBRIDGE – Inequality has become a major political preoccupation in the advanced economies – and for good reason.
In the United States, according to the recently released World Inequality Report 2018, the share of national income claimed by the top 1% of the population rose from 11% in 1980 to 20% in 2014, compared to just 13% for the entire bottom half of the population.
Qualitatively similar, though less pronounced, trends characterize other major countries such as France, Germany, and the United Kingdom.
To explain the rise in inequality that began in the 1980s and has accelerated since the turn of the century, many have pointed out that indicators of globalization, such as the trade-to-GDP ratio, have also risen since 1980.
But does that correlation imply a causal link between trade and inequality?
There are certainly reasons to doubt it.
The global trade-to-GDP ratio peaked in 2008 at 61%, after a 35-year climb, falling back to 56% by 2016 – at precisely the time when fear of globalization reached political fever pitch.
What if we look at the world as a whole, rather than individual countries?
As Columbia’s Xavier Sala-i-Martin pointed out in 2002 and 2006, even as inequality has risen in nearly every country, inequality across countries has decreased, owing largely to the success of developing countries like China and India in raising their per capita incomes since the 1980s.
Multiple factors, including urbanization, high savings rates, and improved access to education, undoubtedly underlie these countries’ impressive performance.
But, if one uses geography to isolate exogenous determinants of trade, it becomes apparent that trade has been among the most powerful drivers of Asia’s economic success, and thus the convergence between the developed and developing worlds.
For someone like US President Donald Trump, this would indicate that Asia’s success has come at America’s expense.
This view of trade as a zero-sum game was a feature of the mercantilist theory that reigned three centuries ago, before Adam Smith and David Ricardo made the case that trade would normally benefit both partners, by enabling each to take advantage of their comparative advantages.
But the Smith-Ricardo theory has a key limitation: it does not distinguish among a country’s citizens, and therefore cannot address the question of income distribution within a country.
Given this, the Heckscher-Ohlin-Stolper-Samuelson model may be more useful, as it distinguishes between workers and owners of physical, financial, or human (skills) capital.
The HO-SS theory, which dominated international economic thinking from the 1950s through 1970s, predicted that international trade would benefit the abundant factor of production (in rich countries, the owners of capital) and hurt the scarce factor of production (in rich countries, unskilled labor).
Workers could command higher wages if they did not have to compete against abundant labor in poorer countries.
Then came the post-1980 revolutions in trade theory.
Paul Krugman and Elhanan Helpman introduced the previously neglected elements of imperfect competition and increasing returns to scale.
Later, in 2003, Marc Melitz showed how trade could shift resources from low-productivity to high-productivity firms.
Critics of globalization latched onto these newer economic theories, claiming that they demanded a rethinking of the traditional case for free trade.
It was precisely at that time, however, that the HO-SS trade theory’s prediction that free trade would hurt lower-skill workers in rich countries apparently began to materialize.
Yet not all of the HO-SS theory’s predictions have come true.
As Pinelopi Goldberg and Nina Pavcnik reported in 2007, the expectation that trade would reduce inequality in the countries with the most unskilled workers, because their services are in greater demand in an integrated world market, has not been borne out.
“There is overwhelming evidence,” they write, “that less-skilled workers in developing countries “are generally not better off, at least not relative to workers with higher skill or education levels.”
In the same year, Branko Milanović and Lyn Squire also found that tariff reduction is associated with higher inequality in poor countries.
Ten years later, inequality continues to worsen within developing countries, including the so-called BRICS emerging economies.
In Brazil, the top 1% accounts for 25% of national income.
In Russia, the income share of the top 1% of the population increased from 4% in 1980 to 20% in 2015.
Likewise, in India, that figure rose from 6% in 1982 to 22% in 2013.
In China, it surged from 6% in 1978 to 14% in 2015.
And, in South Africa, it rose from 9% in 1987 to 19% in 2012.
A look at the top 10% of earners shows similar trends.
This does not mean that the forces described by the HO-SS theory are irrelevant. But there is clearly more to current inequality trends than trade.
Technological progress – which has raised demand for skilled workers relative to unskilled workers, at a time when the supply of skilled graduates lags – seems to be a major factor everywhere.
The growing tendency of many professions to produce winner-take-all outcomes may play a role as well.
A lack of redistribution through taxes in a country like the US (compared to major countries in Europe) does not help matters.
Inequality is clearly a serious problem that merits political attention. But focusing on trade is not the way to resolve it.
World Order 2.0
NEW YORK – For nearly four centuries, since the Peace of Westphalia in 1648 ended the Thirty Years’ War in Europe, the concept of sovereignty – the right of countries to an independent existence and autonomy – has formed the core of the international order.
And for good reason: as we have seen in century after century, including the current one, a world in which borders are forcibly violated is a world of instability and conflict.
But, in a globalized world, a global operating system premised solely on respect for sovereignty – call it World Order 1.0 – has become increasingly inadequate.
Little stays local anymore.
Just about anyone and anything, from tourists, terrorists, and refugees to e-mails, diseases, dollars, and greenhouse gases, can reach almost anywhere.
The result is that what goes on inside a country can no longer be the concern of that country alone.
Today’s realities call for an updated operating system—World Order 2.0 – based on “sovereign obligation,” the notion that sovereign states have not just rights but also obligations to others.
A new international order will also require an expanded set of norms and arrangements, beginning with an agreed-upon basis for statehood.
Existing governments would agree to consider bids for statehood only in cases where there was a historical justification, a compelling rationale, and popular support, and where the proposed new entity is viable.
World Order 2.0 must also include prohibitions on carrying out or in any way supporting terrorism.
More controversially, it must include strengthened norms proscribing the spread or use of weapons of mass destruction.
As it stands, while the world tends to agree on constraining proliferation by limiting countries’ access to the relevant technology and material, the consensus often breaks down once proliferation has occurred.
This should become a topic of discussion at bilateral and multilateral meetings, not because it would lead to a formal agreement, but because it would focus attention on applying stringent sanctions or undertaking military action, which could then reduce the odds of proliferation.
Another essential element of a new international order is cooperation on climate change, which may be the quintessential manifestation of globalization, because all countries are exposed to its effects, regardless of their contribution to it.
The 2015 Paris climate agreement – in which governments agreed to limit their emissions and to provide resources to help poorer countries adapt – was a step in the right direction.
Progress on this front must continue.
Cyberspace is the newest domain of international activity characterized by both cooperation and conflict.
The goal in this area should be to create international arrangements that encourage benign uses of cyberspace and discourage malign uses.
Governments would have to act consistently within this regime as part of their sovereign obligations – or face sanctions or retaliation.
Global health presents a different set of challenges.
In a globalized world, an outbreak of infectious disease in one country could quickly evolve into a serious threat to health elsewhere, as has happened in recent years with SARS, Ebola, and Zika.
Fortunately, the notion of sovereign obligation is already advanced in this sphere: countries are responsible for trying to detect infectious disease outbreaks, responding appropriately, and notifying others around the world.
When it comes to refugees, there is no substitute for effective local action aimed at preventing situations that generate large refugee flows in the first place.
In principle, this is an argument for humanitarian intervention in selective situations.
But translating this principle into practice will remain difficult, given divergent political agendas and the high costs of effective intervention.
Even without a consensus, however, there is a strong case for increasing funding for refugees, ensuring their humane treatment, and setting fair quotas for their resettlement.
Trade agreements are, by definition, pacts of reciprocal sovereign obligations regarding tariff and nontariff barriers.
When a party believes that obligations are not being met, it has recourse to arbitration through the World Trade Organization.
But things are less clear when it comes to government subsidies or currency manipulation.
The challenge, therefore, is to define appropriate sovereign obligations in these areas in future trade pacts, and to create mechanisms to hold governments accountable.
Establishing the concept of sovereign obligations as a pillar of the international order will take decades of consultations and negotiations – and even then, its acceptance and impact will be uneven.
Progress will come only voluntarily, from countries themselves, rather than from any top-down edict.
Realistically, it will be difficult to forge agreement on what specific sovereign obligations states have and how they should be enforced.
Complicating matters further, US President Donald Trump’s administration has espoused an “America first” doctrine that is largely inconsistent with what is being suggested here.
If this remains the US approach, progress toward building the sort of order that today’s interconnected world demands will come about only if other major powers push it – or it will have to wait for Trump’s successor.
Such an approach, however, would be second best, and it would leave the United States and the rest of the world worse off.
Now is the time to begin the necessary conversations.
Globalization is here to stay.
Moving toward a new international order that incorporates sovereign obligation is the best way to cope.
World Order 2.0, predicated on sovereign obligation, is certainly an ambitious project – but one born of realism, not idealism.
Who Will Fill America’s Shoes?
NEW YORK – It is increasingly clear that US President Donald Trump represents a departure when it comes to America’s global outlook and behavior.
As a result, the United States will no longer play the leading international role that has defined its foreign policy for three quarters of a century, under Democratic and Republican presidents alike.
We have already seen many examples of this change.
The traditional US commitment to global organizations has been superseded by the idea of “America first.”
Alliances and security guarantees once regarded as a given are increasingly conditioned on how much allies spend on defense and whether they are seen to derive unfair advantage from trade with the US.
More broadly, foreign trade is viewed with suspicion – supposedly a source of job loss rather than an engine of investment, job creation, growth, and stability.
Immigration and refugee policies have become more restrictive.
Less emphasis is being placed on promoting democracy and human rights.
More dollars are going to defense, but fewer resources are being devoted to supporting global health or development.
This is not to be confused with isolationism.
Even Trump’s America will continue to play a meaningful role in the world.
It is using military force in the Middle East and Afghanistan, increasing diplomatic pressure on North Korea to rein in its nuclear and missile programs, and renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico.
And the policies of states, cities, and companies will translate into an American commitment to climate change, despite Trump’s decision to abandon the Paris agreement.
Still, a shift away from a US-dominated world of structured relationships and standing institutions and toward something else is under way.
What this alternative will be, however, remains largely unknowable.
What we do know is that there is no alternative great power willing and able to step in and assume what had been the US role.
China is a frequently mentioned candidate, but its leadership is focused mostly on consolidating domestic order and maintaining artificially high economic-growth rates to stave off popular unrest.
China’s interest in regional and global institutions seems designed mostly to bolster its economy and geopolitical influence, rather than to help set rules and create broadly beneficial arrangements.
Likewise, Russia is a country with a narrowly-based economy led by a government focused on retaining power at home and re-establishing Russian influence in the Middle East and Europe.
India is preoccupied with the challenge of economic development and is tied down by its problematic relationship with Pakistan.
Japan is held back by its declining population, domestic political and economic constraints, and its neighbors’ suspicions.
Europe, for its part, is distracted by questions surrounding the relationship between member states and the European Union.
As a result, the whole of the continent is less than the sum of its parts – none of which is large enough to succeed America on the world stage.
But the absence of a single successor to the US does not mean that what awaits is chaos.
At least in principle, the world’s most powerful countries could come together to fill America’s shoes.
In practice, though, this will not happen, as these countries lack the capabilities, experience, and, above all, a consensus on what needs doing and who needs to do it.
A more likely development is the emergence of a mix of order and disorder at both the regional and global level.
China will promote various trade, infrastructure, and security mechanisms in Asia.
The 11 remaining members of the Trans-Pacific Partnership may launch their trade pact without the US.
Less clear is whether China is prepared to use its influence to restrain North Korea, how India and Pakistan will avoid conflict, and the resolution of Asia’s many territorial disputes.
It is all too easy to imagine an Asian and Pacific future characterized by higher spending on arms of all types – and thus more susceptible to violent conflict.
The Middle East is already suffering unprecedented instability, the result of local rivalries and realities, and of 15 years during which the US arguably first did too much and then too little to shape the region’s future.
The immediate danger is not just further deterioration in failed states such as Yemen, Syria, and Libya, but also direct conflict between Saudi Arabia and Iran.
Europe may be something of an exception to such trends, as the election of President Emmanuel Macron in France has given rise to a government that is committed to reforming the EU.
But the EU itself faces an uncertain future, given Brexit and slow-motion crises in Italy and Greece, not to mention the potential for additional Russian mischief or worse.
To all of this, one could add the meltdown in Venezuela and the all-too-familiar horrors in South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
And then there is the growing gap between global challenges such as how to govern cyberspace, and the willingness of governments to work together to address them.
There is no little irony in this global turn of events.
For decades, many countries criticized US policy, both for what it was and what it was not.
These same countries now face the prospect of a world in which American leadership is likely to be less of a factor.
It is far from clear that they are prepared for such a world, or that they will find themselves better off in it.
From the Front Lines of Climate Change
MANILA/SAN JOSÉ – On April 22, dignitaries representing no fewer than 175 parties signed the global climate change agreement concluded in Paris in December, setting a record for the adoption of an international accord.
The show of support is heartening.
It provides hope that the momentum that led to the breakthrough deal in December remains undiminished.
But securing an agreement in Paris was just the first step on a long road towards protecting the global climate and the world’s most vulnerable countries.
The signing ceremony was the second.
Next comes the ratification process; 55 countries, representing at least 55% of global emissions, will need to ratify the agreement to enable it to enter into force.
The good news is that the process is already underway.
In February, Fiji became the first nation to ratify the treaty, followed by three other small island states.
All four are members of the Climate Vulnerable Forum, a group of 43 countries – including Costa Rica and the Philippines, which we represent – on the front lines of climate change.
Members of the forum fought tirelessly for an agreement in Paris, and we will do everything within our power to speed up its entry into force.
The Paris agreement offers the world its best hope of slowing and ultimately stopping changes to our climate.
Left unchecked, global warming will threaten the health and safety of our people, damage the ecosystems on which we all depend, and – through rising sea levels – put the very existence of some countries in jeopardy.
And yet, if the battle against climate change is to be won, the Paris agreement will not be sufficient.
The voluntary emission-reduction commitments contained in the so-called Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs), submitted by 187 countries by the end of the talks, will not be enough to prevent dangerous climate change.
And for those countries that are most vulnerable to the harmful effects of global warming, far more needs to be done if catastrophic effects are to be avoided.
Early calculations have suggested that if all of the INDCs were fully implemented, average global temperatures would still rise by the end of the century to 2.7 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.
That is considerably beyond the already dangerous ceiling of two degrees set in Copenhagen in 2009 and included in the Paris agreement.
New research, from Climate Interactive and MIT Sloan, suggests that temperatures could rise even higher – by 3.5 degrees Celsius.
The Climate Vulnerable Forum has long argued that even two degrees of warming risks creating unbearable conditions for some countries.
That is why it has fought to limit the rise in temperature to 1.5 degrees – an ambition that was included, thanks to the forum’s efforts, in the Paris agreement.
That seemingly small difference matters.
As the latest research shows, it would have a dramatic and measurable impact on extreme weather events, water availability, crop yields, coral-reef degradation, and sea-level rise.
And it will be the most vulnerable people – rural women, the sick, the old, and the very young – who are most at risk.
For the world’s most vulnerable countries, limiting the temperature rise to 1.5 degrees is not just an aspiration; it is a matter of survival.
The goal is an ambitious one. But vulnerable developing countries are committed to helping achieve it.
The V-20 group of finance ministers of vulnerable nations recently committed to introducing carbon-pricing mechanisms across 43 markets within ten years.
We have also pledged to improve financial accounting, so that the costs of climate change and the benefits of climate action are incorporated into economic policymaking.
Costa Rica has just approved a law promoting electric trains, and legislators are debating a bill to provide incentives for electric vehicles and buses.
Such initiatives are more commonly associated with advanced economies than with developing countries.
And the rich world does have a moral obligation to move first and faster – with policies, technologies, and finance – to reduce the emissions that cause global warming.
But we also recognize that developing countries have a responsibility to act and that doing so can generate immense economic, social, and public health advantages for their citizens.
We cannot succeed on our own; this much is certain.
The Climate Vulnerable Forum represents a tiny share of global emissions.
We need the industrialized countries and the giants of the developing world to redouble their efforts to reduce their emissions, so that global warming can be limited to 1.5 degrees.
Only then can disaster be averted.
The Scarecrow of National Debt
CAMBRIDGE – Most people are more worried by government debt than about taxation.
“But it’s trillions” a friend of mine recently expostulated about the United Kingdom’s national debt.
He exaggerated a bit: it is £1.7 trillion ($2.2 trillion).
But one website features a clock showing the debt growing at a rate of £5,170 per second.
Although the tax take is far less, the UK government still collected a hefty £750 billion in taxes in the last fiscal year.
The tax base grows by the second, too, but no clock shows that.
Many people think that, however depressing heavy taxes are, it is more honest for governments to raise them to pay for their spending than it is to incur debt.
Borrowing strikes them as a way of taxing by stealth.
“How are they going to pay it back?” my friend asked.
“Think of the burden on our children and grandchildren.”
I should say that my friend is extremely old.
Horror of debt is particularly marked in the elderly, perhaps out of an ancient feeling that one should not meet one’s maker with a negative balance sheet.
I should also add that my friend is extremely well educated, and had, in fact, played a prominent role in public life.
But public finance is a mystery to him: he just had the gut feeling that a national debt in the trillions and growing by £5,170 a second was a very bad thing.
One should not attribute this gut feeling to financial illiteracy. It has been receiving strong support from those supposedly well-versed in public finance, particularly since the economic collapse of 2008.
Britain’s national debt currently stands at 84% of GDP.
This is dangerously near the threshold of 90% identified by Harvard economist Kenneth Rogoff (together with Carmen Reinhart and Vincent Reinhart), beyond which economic growth stalls.
In the face of criticism of the data underlying this threshold Rogoff has held firm, and he now gives a reason for his alarm.
With US government debt running at 82% of GDP, the danger is of a “fast upward shift in interest rates.” The “potentially massive” fiscal costs of this could well require “significant tax and spending adjustments” (economist’s code for increasing taxes and reducing public spending), which would increase unemployment.
This is the financial leg of the familiar “crowding out” argument.
The higher the national debt, according to this view, the greater the risk of government default – and therefore the higher the cost of fresh government borrowing.
This in turn will raise the cost of new private-sector borrowing.
(That is why Rogoff wants the US government to “lock in” currently low rates by issuing much longer-term debt to fund public infrastructure).
Maintaining low interest rates for private bank loans has been one of the main arguments for reducing budget deficits.
But this argument – or set of arguments (there are different strands) – for fiscal austerity is invalid.
A government that can issue debt in its own currency can easily keep interest rates low.
The rates are bounded by concerns about inflation, over-expansion of the state sector, and the central bank’s independence; but, with our relatively low levels of debt (Japan’s debt amounts to over 230% of its GDP) and depressed output and inflation, these limits are quite distant in the UK and the US.
And as the record bears out, continuous increases in both countries’ national debt since the crash have been accompanied by a fall in the cost of government borrowing to near zero.
The other leg of the argument for reducing the national debt has to do with the “burden on future generations.”
US President Dwight Eisenhower expressed this thought succinctly in his State of the Union message in 1960: generating a surplus to pay back debt was a necessary “reduction on our children’s inherited mortgage.”
The idea is that future generations would need to reduce their consumption in order to pay the taxes required to retire the outstanding debt: government deficits today “crowd out” the next generation’s consumption.
Although governments have endlessly repeated this argument since the 2008 crash as a justification for fiscal tightening, the economist A. P. Lerner pointed out its fallacy years ago.
The burden of reduced consumption to pay for government spending is actually borne by the generation which lends the government the money in the first place.
This is crystal clear if the government simply raises the money it needs for its spending through taxes rather than borrowing it.
Furthermore, the idea that additional government spending, whether financed by taxation or borrowing, is bound to reduce private consumption by the same amount assumes that no flow of additional income results from the extra government spending – in other words, that the economy is already at full capacity.
This has not been true of most countries since 2008.
But in the face of such weighty, if fallacious, testimony to the contrary, who am I to persuade my elderly friend to ignore his gut when it comes to thinking about the national debt?
Greece, Argentina, and the Middle-Income Trap
SANTIAGO – Aside from an established tradition of bad macroeconomics, what do Greece and Argentina have in common?
One answer is that they were the world’s longest-held captives of the so-called middle-income trap – and remain within its reach to this day.
With countries in Asia, Eastern Europe, and Latin American fearing that, having reached the international middle class, they could be stuck there, Greece and Argentina shed light on how that might happen.
A recent paper by economists from Bard College and the Asian Development Bank categorizes the world economy according to four groups – with the top two categories occupied by upper-middle-income and high-income countries – and tracks countries’ movements in and out of these groups.
Which countries were stuck for the longest period in the upper-middle-income category before moving to high income?
You guessed it: Greece and Argentina.
Correcting for variations in the cost of living across countries, the paper concludes that $10,750 of purchasing power in the year 1990 is the threshold for per capita income beyond which a country is high income, while $7,250 makes it upper-middle income.
(These thresholds may sound low, but the World Bank uses similar cutoffs.)
By these criteria, Argentina became an upper-middle-income country all the way back in 1970, and then spent 40 years stuck in that category before reaching high-income status in 2010.
Greece joined the international upper middle class in 1972, and then took 28 years to reach the top income group, in 2000.
No other country that became upper middle income after 1950, and then made the transition, took nearly as long.
In fact, the average length of that transition was 14 years, with economies such as South Korea, Taiwan, and Hong Kong taking as little as seven years.
Data in the paper stop at 2010, but the story may well be worse today.
According to IMF figures, Greece’s never-ending crisis has cut per capita GDP (in terms of purchasing power parity) by 10% since 2010, and by 18% since 2007.
Indeed, Greece may have dropped out of the high-income category in recent years.
Argentina’s per capita income has risen, albeit slowly, during this period, but the country was never far from a full-blown macroeconomic crisis that could reduce household incomes sharply.
So it seems fair to conclude that both countries are still caught in the middle-income trap.
What kind of trap is it?
In Greece and Argentina, it is both political and economic.
Start with the politics.
In their book Why Nations Fail, Daron Acemoglu and James A. Robinson argue that societies with political arrangements that concentrate power in the hands of a few seldom excel at innovation and growth, because innovators have no guarantee they will keep the fruits of their labors.
And, to the extent that outsiders cannot generate wealth, they have few resources with which to challenge the power of insiders; as a result, exclusionary political arrangements are mostly self-sustaining.
That is a useful account of why there is a poverty trap – which is the question the book seeks to answer – but it does not clarify why there is a middle-income trap.
Greece and Argentina are, after all, democracies, however imperfect, and so are most of the countries in Latin America or East Asia that worry about being stuck at middle-income level.
The Acemoglu-Robinson account of a single small elite pulling all the strings needs to be replaced by a different narrative, in which an array of politically powerful groups exercise veto power over decisions that affect their economic interests.
Think of powerful business groups vetoing moves to improve tax collection or strengthen competition policy.
This helps explain why the Greek and Argentine governments are perennially in deficit (until borrowing options dry up and adjustment is inevitable), or why prices – and profits – are high in sectors (for example, transportation and telecoms) that provide would-be entrepreneurs with crucial (but often unaffordable) inputs.
Or think of public-sector unions vetoing changes in benefits for their members.
That goes a long way toward explaining (add a bit of ideology to the mix) why the current Greek government has gone to the brink of default before agreeing to restrain public-sector pensions, as its European Union partners demand.
It also helps explain why both Greece and Argentina have sizeable governments (public spending accounts for 46% and 39% of GDP, respectively) but puny public investment and outdated infrastructure.
This is not a case of too much democracy, as conservative commentators sometimes claim, but of too little.
Underdeveloped democratic institutions allow for decisions that are individually rational but collectively shortsighted and harmful.
And bad politics makes for bad economics.
To go from middle-income to high-income status, countries have to redeploy resources to high-productivity, knowledge- and skill-intensive sectors.
That is a transition that Greece and Argentina, with their financial instability, poor infrastructure, and weak education systems, have never made.
Greece exports refined petroleum products, olive oil, raw cotton, and dried fruit.
Argentina exports corn, soybeans, fruits, and wine – as well as cars and auto parts to the rest of the regional Mercosur trade bloc, where it enjoys ample tariff protection against third-country competition.
According to the Atlas of Economic Complexity, developed by Ricardo Hausmann and colleagues at Harvard University, the 2008 gap between Greece’s income and the knowledge content of its exports was the largest in a sample of 128 countries.
By 2013, Greece ranked 48th in the Atlas’s index of complexity of exports – by far the lowest of any developed country in Europe – while Argentina ranked 67th.
Sluggish exports mean slow growth, which in turn places limits on social mobility and the expansion of an entrepreneurial middle class.
That helps preserve the political power of entrenched veto-wielding players, closing the trap.
Perhaps a weighty tome entitled Why Middle-Income Nations Fail will tell the story in full.
Societies will then understand why high-income status eludes them – and what they might do differently.
Lesbos’s Ghosts, Europe’s Disgrace
ATHENS – In 2015, hundreds of thousands of refugees landed on Greece’s island shores.
Many had perished at sea.
Today, the international public has been lulled into believing that Greece’s refugee crisis has abated.
In fact, it has become a permanent scourge blighting Europe’s soul and brewing future trouble.
The island of Lesbos was, and remains, its epicenter.
The story of Shabbir demonstrates how starkly reality clashes with Europe’s official storyline.
Shabbir, 40, lived with his wife and two young children in a midsize town in Pakistan, where he ran a car rental business.
One night in December 2015, a local group of Islamist extremists petrol-bombed Shabbir’s neighbor’s home and waited outside for the fleeing family.
Shabbir’s neighbors were Christian, and the extremists were keen to evict them and convert their home into a madrasa (religious school).
Instinctively, Shabbir rushed to his Christian neighbors’ defense.
Designated an “apostate,” his business was burned down, his brother was brutally murdered, his wife and children fled to neighboring villages, and Shabbir, together with his elderly father, took the long, cruel road, via Iran and Turkey, to imagined safety in civilized Europe.
Along the way, Shabbir’s father died of exhaustion on some snow-covered Turkish mountain peak.
Months later, after managing to board a trafficker’s flimsy vessel on Turkey’s Aegean coast, he found himself shipwrecked, surrounded by dozens of drowned fellow refugees.
Picked up off the coast of Lesbos, he was brought to the Moria camp.
That is when his next ordeal began.
No Westerner who saw Moria during the winter of 2016/2017 could do so without feeling dehumanized.
Mud, refuse, and human excrement formed a magma of misery, a hellscape surrounded by barbed wire and the official indifference reflected in the puny resources provided by the European Union and Greek authorities.
Refugees like Shabbir faced a minimum of nine months before their first encounter with any official who would receive their asylum application.
Within the camp, a small makeshift office, surrounded by more barbed wire and hundreds of despairing refugees, would admit one or two per hour for their first interview.
“If you are a little ill, Afghani or Pakistani, it may take 12 months before you speak to an official,” one refugee told us.
“We are ghosts roaming around without anyone noticing,” he remarked: “I wish we had died in the war instead.”
Wandering around the camp, segregation was in plain sight.
Some families were afforded the luxury of containers, guarded behind tall fences.
Despite the absence of running water, heating, or any facilities to speak of, they were the privileged ones.
Walking northwest up the hill was like experiencing the ascent of inhumanity.
First there was the Afghanis’ shantytown, enveloped in mud and an unbearable stench.
On the hilltop were Pakistanis in the same dire conditions, burning anything they could find in order to cook.
Next to them were Algerians, feared by all the others and caged behind a triple row of barbed wire.
At the foot of the slope, just next to the appalling semi-open-air toilets, were the “Africans,” amidst whose tents runs filth from up the slope.
A year after Shabbir arrived on Lesbos, and three months after his first interview, his asylum application was refused and a deportation order was issued.
His appeal was unceremoniously rejected and, when he tried to seek refuge with supporters in a nearby village, the police mounted a manhunt. Eventually, he surrendered, before being taken back to Turkey.
For weeks, we heard nothing of his fate. Then we learned that he was returned to Pakistan, where he had been located by the Taliban and shot.
Reportedly, he is still alive, though we do not know his condition.
Shabbir had imagined, he told one of us, that, “despite being Muslim,” Europe would give him asylum, “not least because I thought that defending Christians at my family’s expense would mean something here.”
But “Europe” had other ideas.
The EU deal with Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, negotiated in 2016 by German Chancellor Angela Merkel, had a single purpose: To stop the flood of refugees from Turkey to Greece at all cost.
If that meant that the EU would end up bribing Erdoğan with several billion euros in order to violate international legislation protecting refugees like Shabbir, so be it.
In September alone, another 2,238 refugees arrived in Lesbos, despite Turkey’s attempts to cut the flow.
A camp designed for 2,000 people now “houses” three times that number.
In early October, the first autumnal storms turned the Moria camp into a mud field again.
Europe pretends to itself that this crime against humanity is no one’s fault.
The Greek authorities blame the EU for not providing funds, the EU blames Greece for not doing enough with available funds, and large NGOs are preoccupied with maintaining their own line of command and funding.
The only survivors in this moral shipwreck are the local grassroots teams – comprising volunteers from all over the world and smaller NGOs – that have been keeping the spirit of humanity alive.
Meanwhile, the West in general, and the EU in particular, perpetuates the economic, environmental, and military factors driving the unfolding humanitarian disaster.
Galrim, another Pakistani refugee in Lesbos, explained to us Europe’s blunder: “The Islamist extremists have a plan.
By spreading fear and loathing,” he says, “they wish to ghettoize refugees in Europe, to cut them off from European societies, to make them victims of European xenophobia.
It is their recruitment strategy by which to stoke the fires of East-West hatred and render them significant players.”
Galrim should know.
A democrat who opposed ballot rigging in his town, his body was broken by mafia networks in “safe” Turkey, in a succession of torture sessions for ransom.
On one occasion, he was dragged behind a speeding truck.
Galrim’s asylum application was also turned down, placing him on the deportation list.
Some 2,500 years ago, Sappho of Lesbos wrote:
Their heart grew cold
they let their wings down
To prevent that from happening to humanists across Europe, we need a new movement to campaign for refugees’ release from odious conditions and a swift asylum process.
Beyond that, we need to end the policies that are contributing to their desperate flight.
A State-Powered Green Revolution
LONDON – Discussions about building a green future tend to focus on the need to improve the generation of energy from renewable sources.
But that is just the first step.
Better mechanisms for storing and releasing that energy – when the sun isn’t shining, the wind isn’t blowing, or when electric cars are on the move – are also critical.
And, contrary to popular belief, it is the public sector that is leading the way toward effective solutions.
Since the commercial development of lithium-ion batteries – the rechargeable batteries common in consumer electronics – in the early 1990s, the challenge of storing and releasing power effectively enough to make sustainable energy sources viable alternatives to fossil fuels has been a vexing one.
And efforts by entrepreneurial billionaires like Bill Gates and Elon Musk to overcome this challenge have been the focus of much excited media speculation.
So how many billionaires does it take to change a battery?
The answer, it turns out, is zero.
This week, Ellen Williams, Director of the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy, part of the US Department of Energy, announced that her agency had beaten the billionaires to it.
ARPA-E, she declared, had attained “some holy grails in batteries,” which will enable us to “create a totally new approach to battery technology, make it work, make it commercially viable.”
While praising Musk’s achievements, Williams drew a sharp distinction between their approaches.
Musk has been engaged in the large-scale production of “an existing, pretty powerful battery technology.”
ARPA-E, by contrast, has been pursuing technological innovation in the purest sense: “creating new ways of doing” things.
And they “are pretty well convinced” that some of their technologies “have the potential to be significantly better.”
To many people, this development may seem surprising.
After all, the private sector has long been regarded as an economy’s most important source of innovation.
But this perception is not entirely accurate.
In fact, history’s great entrepreneurial figures have frequently stood on the shoulders of the entrepreneurial state.
The late Apple founder and CEO Steve Jobs was a smart businessman, but every technology that makes the iPhone “smart” was developed with state funding.
That is why Gates has declared that only the state, in the form of public institutions like ARPA-E, can lead the way to an energy breakthrough.
It is critical to note here that it is not the state as administrator fulfilling this role; rather, it is the entrepreneurial state in action, creating markets, instead of just fixing them.
With a mission-oriented approach and the freedom to experiment – with failure understood to be an unavoidable, and even welcome, feature of the learning process – the state is better able to attract top talent and pursue radical innovation.
But, of course, leading a green revolution will be no easy feat.
To succeed, public agencies will have to overcome significant challenges.
Consider ARPA-E, which was founded in 2009 as part of US President Barack Obama’s economic-stimulus package.
Though still in its infancy, the agency – based on the model of the long-established Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) – has already shown major promise.
And, following the commitment, made by Obama and 19 other world leaders at last December’s climate change conference in Paris, to double public investment in green-energy research, ARPA-E seems set to receive a welcome boost in funding.
But ARPA-E still lacks the capacity to create and shape new markets that, say, DARPA enjoys.
This represents a major challenge, because the agency is working in an industry that remains in its early stages.
Though the development of wind- and solar-power technologies received a big push in the 1970s, both are still marked by market and technological uncertainty.
The embedded energy infrastructure retains strong incumbency advantages, and markets do not value sustainability adequately or price waste and pollution fairly.
In the face of such uncertainty, the business sector will not enter the market until the riskiest and most capital-intensive investments have been made, or until coherent and systematic political signals have been communicated.
Governments must therefore act decisively to make the needed investments and provide the right signals.
Crucially, governments must also install safeguards to ensure that the entrepreneurial state reaps an appropriate share of the rewards for its efforts.
In the past, this might have happened via tax spillovers.
But the top marginal rate is nowhere near the level it was in the 1950s, when NASA, a foremost example of state-sponsored innovation, was founded in the US.
(At that time, the highest marginal tax rate was 91%.)
Indeed, thanks to the lobbying of Silicon Valley venture capitalists, capital gains tax fell by 50% in five years at the end of the 1970s.
The increased use of upstream patenting has weakened spillovers.
Of course, private-sector players like Gates and Musk are essential partners in driving forward the green revolution.
As they assume a greater role in the commercialization and deployment of battery-storage technology, they will earn their fair share of rewards.
But shouldn’t the ARPA-E (or its angel investors – US taxpayers) also get some return, for its early – and risky – investment?
In some countries, such as Israel (with its Yozma program) and Finland (with its Sitra fund), the government has retained a stake in state-funded innovation.
This enables the entrepreneurial state to continue to invest, catalyzing the next wave of innovations.
Why are Western countries so resistant to this sensible idea?
The Right Question About Inequality and Growth
CAMBRIDGE – The belief that inequality hurts economic growth is gaining currency among policymakers.
Some argue forcefully that high levels of inequality can make sustained growth impossible, and may even contribute to recessions.
This view stands in stark contrast to the traditional view that there is a tradeoff between equality and growth, and that greater inequality is a price that must be paid for higher output.
Lost in the discussion, however, is whether any of this is actually germane to economic policymaking.
I don’t believe it is.
Whether inequality is good or bad for growth should and will continue to concern social scientists.
But those guiding an economy should focus on assessing outcomes and modes of distribution rather than on a puzzle that will never fully be solved.
Three developments make this refocusing necessary.
For starters, while recent studies have concluded that higher levels of inequality produce lower long-term growth, other data have challenged this assumption, making definitive claims that are impossible to support, partly because different sources and types of inequality likely have different impacts on growth.
Second, most research focuses on the impact of inequality on growth, rather than on how specific policies affect growth.
The former is of interest to social scientists and historians, but it is the latter that is relevant for policymakers.
And, finally, politicians generally defend their policies in terms of how they affect the middle class or the poor, not the arithmetic average of incomes across an economy – which gives equal weight to a $1 increase in the income of a poor person and that of a billionaire.
So, even if reducing inequality was bad for overall growth, it might still be good for social welfare in the relevant sense, if it made many households in the middle better off.
The fact is, economic policies in the real world are nuanced and site-specific, making the search for a single answer to the question of how – and how much – inequality affects growth a Sisyphean task.
Rather than concerning themselves with how to balance growth and inequality, policymakers would do better to focus on how policies impact average incomes and other welfare indicators.
Win-win policies – defined as distribution mechanisms that produce growth and reduce inequality simultaneously – are the easiest to evaluate, and the most advantageous to adopt.
Education is a classic example.
Reforms that cost little or no money, such as improving the quality of primary and secondary education, have been shown to encourage growth while ameliorating inequality.
Even reforms that cost more – like expanding preschool education in the United States – generate economic benefits that far exceed the tax losses associated with funding them.
These types of approaches – what I call “all good things go together” policies – could be applied to other sectors of the economy that are being squeezed by imperfect competition.
More vigorous antitrust policies, or increased consumer ownership of data, could strengthen competition and, in the process, boost efficiency and improve income distribution.
Any policy that promotes growth or lowers inequality without negatively affecting the other variable can also be classified as a win-win.
A revenue-neutral reform of business taxes, for example, could raise the level of output with no meaningful impact on the distribution of income.
It is far more difficult to evaluate policies that involve a tradeoff between growth and inequality.
For the sake of illustration, consider the effects of a hypothetical 10% reduction in labor taxes paid for by a lump-sum tax modeled using a neo-classical Ramsey growth model – a scenario that I detailed in a recent paper for the Olivier Blanchard and Lawrence Summers series on Rethinking Macroeconomics.
This plan is good for growth, with average output increasing by 1%.
But to understand how this policy would actually play out for taxpayers, I applied the scenario to the real distribution of US household incomes in 2010.
Nearly all households in the model experienced an increase in pre-tax income.
But taxes increased for two-thirds of households.
For middle-income households, the increased taxation was offset by earnings, but leisure also fell.
As a result, the tax change left around 60% of households worse off, even as average household income grew, driven by gains at the top.
This analysis does not answer the question of whether this illustrative tax policy is a good idea.
But most policymakers would likely object if they understood that growth would be achieved by higher taxes on two-thirds of households, leaving the median household working harder to earn the same after-tax income.
Social scientists should continue to ask whether inequality is good or bad for economic growth. More research is needed on the variables that affect growth, such as median income.
Economists should also pay less attention to inequality in the aggregate, and more on the specific policies that might increase or reduce inequality.
But policymakers have different priorities than economists do.
Rather than rethinking macroeconomics, policymakers must consider whether specific goals for social welfare and distribution can be achieved through win-win measures or through policies that make worthwhile tradeoffs.
The answer may be to obsess less over aggregate data, and to focus more on how policy decisions impact real people.
Will Palestinian Reconciliation Revive the Two-State Solution?
RAMALLAH – When representatives of the two major Palestinian factions, Fatah and Hamas, signed a new reconciliation agreement in Cairo on October 12, the focus was not on those actually doing the signing, Fatah Central Committee member Azzam al-Ahmad and Deputy Head of the Hamas Politburo Saleh al-Arouri.
Instead, all eyes were on the man standing behind them: Khaled Fawzy, the head of Egypt’s General Intelligence Directorate.
The ceremony, held at the intelligence agency’s headquarters, was orchestrated entirely by the Egyptians, who view the reconciliation as a stepping-stone to a much larger goal.
As the agreement stated in its opening, it stemmed from Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi’s “insistence” on ending the divisions among Palestinians, “with the aim of creating an independent state” along pre-1967 borders.
Egypt’s leadership in this process will raise the country’s standing in the Arab world, reinforcing its position as a regional heavyweight.
Already, the reconciliation agreement between Hamas and Fatah has gone some way toward achieving that, while providing a badly needed morale boost for Sisi’s government.
The good news for Egypt is that the Palestinians have shown a renewed willingness not only to pursue reconciliation, but also to pursue a difficult negotiating process with Israel and its main strategic ally, the United States.
This revival of Palestinian national politics largely reflects the recent shift in Hamas’ stance, which follows years of trials for the Sunni Islamist organization.
The troubles for Hamas began when it chose to back the wrong side in both Syria and Egypt.
Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad’s regime prevailed over the Hamas-supported Islamic rebels in Damascus, while the Hamas-backed Muslim Brotherhood government in Egypt, led by Mohamed Morsi, fell after a year.
Then, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, and Bahrain severed diplomatic relations with Qatar, causing Hamas to lose its Qatari and Iranian financial and political support.
With few friends and even fewer sponsors in the region, Hamas had little choice but to return to its fellow Palestinian.
The group quickly and unconditionally accepted President Mahmoud Abbas’s three demands: to dissolve the Hamas-led administrative committee, to allow the Ramallah-based Palestinian government to resume its role in Gaza, and to allow presidential and parliamentary elections to take place in both Gaza and the West Bank.
Reconciliation among the Palestinians will certainly open the way for peace, not least because the new elections will deliver the needed legitimacy to those tasked with handling negotiations with Israel.
But the real work – for Egypt and the Palestinians – lies ahead.
In order to achieve an independent Palestinian state along pre-1967 borders, both actors will need to work with both the US, under President Donald Trump, and Israel, under Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu.
And, on this front, expectations are low.
Trump claims that he will deliver the “ultimate deal” to resolve the Israel-Palestine conflict.
But Trump and Netanyahu, feeding each other’s hawkishness, both remain unwilling to accept what the rest of the world views as the basic premise of any good deal: a two-state solution.
And the aging Abbas is unlikely to accept whatever bad deal the decidedly pro-Israel Trump administration offers.
Even that futile scenario might be optimistic, as it assumes that talks get off the ground – an impossible feat, if Israel continues its illegal construction of settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories.
Such activities are not just unjust; they are a violation of United Nations Security Council Resolution 2334, adopted nearly unanimously last year (the US, then led by Barack Obama, abstained).
That resolution demanded “that Israel immediately and completely cease all settlement activities in the occupied Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem” – activities that amount to a “flagrant violation under international law.”
Any agreement between Israelis and Palestinians will require deep concessions by both sides – concessions that leaders on both sides will need to convince their respective publics to accept.
Trump’s son-in-law and adviser, Jared Kushner, who has been tasked with settling the conflict, and the Trump administration’s chief negotiator on the issue, Jason Greenblatt, seem to understand this.
Egypt certainly does, having made it clear that a divided Palestinian leadership without a public mandate, like the one to be delivered by new elections, will be unable to carry out serious negotiations or win popular support for any eventual agreement.
The question is whether the Israelis will be willing to make such concessions, allowing either a two-state solution or a system of genuine and credible power-sharing within a single state.
If they aren’t, the recent Palestinian reconciliation, however positive, will not mark the beginning of the end of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
It will merely be the start of a new chapter in the struggle for freedom for Palestinians.
A Silver Lining for a Hard Brexit
LONDON – It is easy to forget that defense and security are not the same thing.
Defense is what countries must resort to when their security breaks down.
And during peacetime, countries spend money on defense precisely because they fear for their security.
Since 2014, the security environment for Britain and the European Union has deteriorated sharply.
In March of that year, Russia invaded Ukraine and annexed Crimea.
It was the first time since World War II that a major European power sought to redraw its own borders by force of arms.
In 1994, Russia agreed to defend Ukraine’s territorial integrity in exchange for Ukraine’s handover of the nuclear weapons it had inherited from the Soviet Union.
But Russia didn’t stop with Crimea; since then, it has waged a low-intensity unconventional war against Ukraine in the country’s eastern Donbas region.
And Ukraine is not alone.
Russia has also sent ships and warplanes to threaten the coasts of other Western countries, abducted an Estonian intelligence officer on NATO territory, and sustained an ongoing military buildup in Eastern Europe, the Arctic, and elsewhere.
Despite these deteriorating security conditions, a slim majority of Britons voted in June 2016 to withdraw from the EU – a decision that could fatally undermine the United Kingdom’s relationship with its European NATO partners.
Making matters worse, in November of 2016, Donald Trump, who has long expressed admiration for Russian President Vladimir Putin, was elected president of the United States.
Although Trump expressed disdain for NATO during the 2016 campaign, he appears to have been reined in by the many generals he has installed in top positions.
Still, he could always change his mind.
The Republican Party is in the throes of a deep internal schism that could end with the victory of its populist wing, led by Trump’s nationalist, anti-EU Svengali, Stephen Bannon.
If Bannon does manage to transform the Republican Party in accordance with his nationalist vision, and if the Republicans retain or regain power in the future, US security commitments to Europe will no longer be reliable.
Continued Russian attacks on Western political systems, or even an outright military attack in Europe, could go unanswered by the US.
Without firm US support, a politically divided EU would be increasingly vulnerable to Russian political domination.
At the same time, a politically cohesive EU would be a bulwark of stability stretching from the English Channel to Ukraine’s Dnieper River.
In the absence of US leadership, a stable and secure EU could thus become the most important pillar of the UK’s post-Brexit security strategy.
But the stability of the EU is far from guaranteed, because a smooth and painless Brexit may tempt other member states to also quit the bloc.
Some argue that this outcome is unlikely, because it is impossible, in practice, for eurozone countries to leave.
If a eurozone country even suggested that it might withdraw from the euro and the EU, the resulting capital flight would devastate its economy.
According to this view, the fact that two-thirds of EU member states belong to the euro is enough to prevent the EU from unraveling.
If only that were so.
In reality, a number of important EU members remain outside the euro, including Poland, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Romania, and Sweden.
Moreover, under favorable circumstances, eurozone countries with current-account surpluses – such as Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, and Austria – could probably leave the euro without suffering catastrophic harm.
And lest we forget, Western electorates have demonstrated a unique capacity for self-harm.
Consider not just Brexit and the election of Trump, but also Catalan separatists’ game of economic Russian roulette over the past month and a half.
As things stand, the UK still seems to be politically incapable of abandoning Brexit altogether, even though that would be the best course of action for all involved.
But between the options of a “soft” and “hard” Brexit – in which Britain would leave the EU single market and customs union – the latter may have at least one advantage.
Namely, it would not further undermine European stability, which also happens to be Britain’s biggest security asset.
To be sure, a “hard” Brexit would come at a high economic cost for the UK.
Industrial supply chains would be disrupted, the construction industry would be denuded of its EU workers, the City of London would lose international importance, the pound would continue depreciating, and the public sector – particularly the National Health Service – would be stretched thin.
The EU, too, would incur costs, albeit much smaller as a share of its overall economy.
Despite the costs, a “hard” Brexit would, at a minimum, discourage other EU members from following the UK’s lead, thereby shoring up European stability and helping Britain maintain its national security, which may be the most important consideration in the long run.
Such an outcome would be ironic, to say the least.
But even more ironic is the fact that those pushing for it are the very Brexiteers who would like to see the EU fail.
They are convinced that their vision of a buccaneering, global Britain can be achieved only with a clean break from Europe.
They might soon find out if they’re right.
The Literary Magic of Harry Potter
PRINCETON – This summer, at literary festivals and bookstores around the world, readers celebrated the 20-year anniversary of the debut of the first book in J.K. Rowling’s Harry Potter series – Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone (re-titled Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone in the United States) – and with good reason.
Since the young wizard’s first appearance on June 26, 1997, the “Boy Who Lived” has become the “Icon Who Endures.”
Over the last two decades, the Harry Potter series has expanded to include seven novels, with a total of 450 million copies in print, including translations into more than six dozen languages.
The eight films spawned by the books have grossed $7 billion, with Harry Potter-themed toys and merchandise garnering another $7 billion.
For those of a certain age and literary mindset, it is difficult to recall a day when global audiences weren’t spellbound by Rowling’s creation.
That is why it is startling for me to recall the sour reception that my students gave Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone in the fall of 1999, when it appeared on the syllabus of my Princeton University course on popular literature, “American Best Sellers,” which I had been teaching since 1993.
A survey of popular writing from the seventeenth century to the present, the course invites students to consider how and why particular best-selling works have captivated their audiences.
At the end of each term, I let the students select the final book as an exercise in popular taste.
In 1999, they chose that first Harry Potter novel.
Potter-mania had hit America’s shores hard that year.
In June, the series’ US publisher rushed the hardcover edition of the second book, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, to bookstores.
It published the third book, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, along with the paperback edition of Sorcerer’s Stone,on September 8.
By the end of that month, Rowling’s novels held the first three slots on the New York Times fiction best-seller list, while the paperback Sorcerer’s Stone sat atop the paperback list.
The magazine Time had even put the bespectacled wizard on its cover.
You couldn’t turn around without knocking into Harry.
My students were eager to see what all the fuss was about.
Boy, were they disappointed.
For them, it was second-rate blather, nowhere near as worthy of their attention as the cherished series from their childhoods, such as The Chronicles of Narnia or The Lord of the Rings.
Despite being only a few years removed from those childhoods, they laid into Harry Potter with the same fervor as many of the notoriously negative adult reviewers: “Derivative.” “Poorly written.”
“Cloying.” For them, Harry held no wonder, no warmth, and no wit.
My students’ antipathy surprised me, but in hindsight, it should not have.
Though adults comprised a significant portion of the Harry Potter audience from the start, these students were in precisely the wrong demographic to appreciate the phenomenon as it was unfolding.
Too old for new children’s books, and too young to have children of their own (as I newly did at the time), they were quick to insist that despite its current popularity, the series would soon fade from memory.
The following autumn, in 2000, the next cohort of students also picked Sorcerer’s Stone for the final text, and, like their peers, they confidently dismissed it.
Fast-forward to the spring of 2007.
I was again teaching “American Best Sellers,” after having set the course aside for a few years.
When it came time for the students to choose the final book, they went with Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone.
I braced myself for their criticisms.
This time, however, the reviews were glowing.
This new group, born between 1986 and 1989, had first read Rowling as pre-teens and early adolescents, not college students, which meant they had practically grown into young adults alongside Harry, Ron, and Hermione.
The same thing happened in the fall of 2010.
For both of these groups, “We grew up with Harry Potter” was a motto, not a label.
Would Harry fade from memory?
Not on your life.
I’ve taught my Best Sellers course twice since 2010, and both times the students have chosen a non-Harry Potter novel to end the semester.
Is it Potter fatigue?
Not likely, judging from the reception the series continues to receive in the other course in which I teach Rowling’s work, “Children’s Literature.”
Here, it is my choice to put a Harry Potter novel on the syllabus. Instead of Sorcerer’s Stone, however, I assign Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban – my favorite book of the seven, which marks the series’ shift from children’s literature to young adult fiction, through its complex treatment of fidelity, betrayal, rage, and mercy.
It is also the favorite of many of my students.
But how long will Harry Potter’s popularity hold?
Each time I teach “Children’s Literature,” I start with a poll: “Which books on the syllabus do you remember reading as a child?”
In 2010, 86% had read Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.
In 2012, that figure rose to 94%.
But in the years since, the percentage has dropped – to 87% in 2014, and to 81% in 2016.
This is all unscientific, I know.
But I’m curious: will it fall under 80% next spring, when I teach “Children’s Literature” again?
Will my students from 1999 and 2000 be proved right, with Harry Potter fading from relevance, never to become an enduring classic?
Or is there an equilibrium point ahead, where the percentage holds steady without declining further?
Perhaps Harry’s 40th anniversary will provide the answers.
Until then, I’ll happily keep inviting him into my classroom.
The Psychology of Superstar Sex Predators
LONDON – The Harvey Weinstein sexual assault scandal shows no sign of winding down.
Just the opposite: police in the United Kingdom are now investigating several allegations involving the Oscar-winning film producer.
While Weinstein has “unequivocally denied” allegations of non-consensual sex, and no arrests have been made, more than two dozen women – including the actors Angelina Jolie, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Rose McGowan – have publicly accused him of harassment.
The allegations stretch over nearly three decades.
Hollywood is struggling to explain how one of its most visible figures could have gotten away with such behavior for so long.
Woody Allen offered an important clue.
Despite working with Weinstein on several films, he claims that no one ever brought allegations of abuse to his attention.
“And they wouldn’t, because you are not interested in it,” Allen told the BBC.
“You are interested in making your movie.”
Others who worked with Weinstein over the years have made similar statements.
Is this the Hollywood equivalent of a police officer’s “blue wall of silence,” or is there something more clinical at work?
One possible answer may be found in the results of recent psychological research.
According to scientists in the United States and Israel, there are certain personality traits – the “dark triad” of narcissism, psychopathy, and Machiavellianism – that are more commonly associated with sexually abusive behavior.
One intriguing finding from this research, published in 2016 in the journal Personality and Individual Differences, is that personality traits associated with a proclivity for harassment may be “specialized psychological adaptations” that allow individuals to exploit “niches” in society.
In other words, some sexual predators may seek careers in particular industries that allow them to exploit others.
The researchers also found that the disposition that makes someone successful may also comprise the personality traits that explain their tendency to exploit.
The traits needed to win Academy Awards, for example, may be similar to the traits of an individual who pursues a large number of sexual partners and relationships requiring little commitment.
Taken a step further, the research suggests that we should not be surprised to find a similar parallel in many others corners of society.
It is not just in Hollywood where the traits that make someone a star could make the same person an abuser.
The “dark triad” study was published long before the allegations against Weinstein came to light, but it remains the most comprehensive investigation into the personalities of sexual harassers.
The researchers – based at Oakland University and the University of Georgia in the US, and Sapir Academic College in Israel – surveyed more than 2,500 Israeli men and women.
Subjects prone to exploiting others demonstrated a number of characteristics, including callousness, disagreeableness, deceitfulness, egocentrism, lack of honesty or humility, and an excessive interest in one’s personal talents and goals.
This last trait – also known as narcissism – is a key component of the dark triad.
Narcissists tend to be convinced of their own magnificence, and believe that other people should be flattered to be in their company – even if that involves unwanted sexual advances.
Machiavellians, meanwhile, believe that the best way to interact with others is to tell them what they want to hear.
Their manipulative default can lead to a pattern of continually deceiving colleagues and friends, which may explain why a Machiavellian personality would engage in sexual harassment or pursue short-term sexual encounters.
They simply believe they are too cunning to get caught.
When abusers are unmasked, they often seek to deflect blame.
Claiming to be suffering from a disorder such as “sexual addiction,” or checking into a rehabilitation clinic for “treatment,” as Weinstein has reportedly done, fits with a classic Machiavellian response.
If the allegations pan out, Weinstein would be an extreme example of a “dark triad” abuser.
But this combination of character traits is not all that rare.
In fact, powerful predators might be lurking around the nearest water cooler right now.
According to a 1994 survey of federal employees in the US, cited in the “dark triad” study, 44% of female workers, and 19% of male workers, reported being sexually harassed on the job within the two previous years.
And, as the authors of the 2016 study remind us, sexual harassment is not always about trying to secure sex.
Rather, psychological drives – including the need to boost one’s sense of self-esteem, attractiveness, or masculinity – may be driving predators’ abuse of power in dominating or degrading others.
What may be particularly relevant to the Weinstein case, whatever the outcome, is that Hollywood is itself a bubble of narcissistic power.
Psychologists could argue that this feature explains the blindness some have demonstrated toward the alleged depraved behavior of one of their colleagues.
Sexual harassment is the immediate focus of the Weinstein case, as it should be, given the severity of the alleged crimes and the distress caused to the victims.
But for psychologists seeking to understand the apparent nexus of success and abuse, Weinstein’s apparent downfall is just the tip of an analytic iceberg.
How to Boost Access to Essential Medicines
DÜSSELDORF – Around the world, health security is increasingly being recognized as the foundation of economic growth.
Healthy populations are better able to produce, trade, and innovate, while unhealthy populations strain public budgets and create risks that discourage economic exchange.
This logic is written into countless European Union reports, and is even gaining traction in the United States, despite the “America First” approach to international affairs embraced by President Donald Trump’s administration.
Against this backdrop, the World Health Organization (WHO), under its new Director-General, Tedros Ghebreyesus, has a unique opportunity to pursue urgently needed reforms.
The WHO’s response to the 2014-2016 Ebola outbreak in West Africa was roundly judged a failure.
And with the emergence of new diseases such as Zika – and the revival of old foes like bubonic plague – there is no question that much of humanity remains at the mercy of biology.
Moreover, globalization has compounded the danger by facilitating the spread of communicable diseases.
A flu outbreak like that of 1918-1920, which killed between 50 and 100 million people, would be even more devastating today.
To prevent such catastrophic outcomes, we need a comprehensive approach for strengthening health-care delivery in low- and middle-income countries.
In particular, these countries need help improving drug delivery and managing chronic diseases such as cancer and diabetes, which impose an immense burden on their economies.
Unfortunately, the WHO’s leadership, like much of the West, has not pursued this course of action, because it has been distracted by an ideological obsession with drug prices.
But drug prices are a vanishingly small part of the problem in countries struggling to build healthy, productive societies.
Of all the drugs on the WHO’s “Essential Medicines” list, 95% are already off-patent, meaning that cheaper generic versions are available worldwide.
In cases where drugs aren’t reaching people who need them, the reason is not high prices, but rather dysfunctional health systems.
Fortunately, public-health analysts have identified a handful of structural reforms that would largely eliminate existing bottlenecks that are hindering the distribution of essential medicines.
The first trouble spot is infrastructure.
More than half of the world’s rural population lacks access to basic health care, compared to about a fifth of the urban population.
Inadequate and unreliable transportation networks make accessing health-care services costly and time-consuming, and impede drug deliveries from supply centers.
With better roads and more fully developed transportation systems, emerging economies could boost not just health outcomes, but also economic and educational opportunities.
A second problem, even in areas with adequate infrastructure, is the prevalence of bureaucratic and economic barriers that limit access to essential medicines.
According to a 2008 study of 36 developing countries, torturous registration and approval processes create frequent shortages of 15 of the most commonly used generic medicines.
For example, in South Africa it can take up to five years for new medicines to reach the market, owing to that country’s drug-registration and labeling regulations.
By streamlining drug-approval processes, removing tariffs, and simplifying customs procedures, many countries could immediately increase the availability of dozens of essential medicines.
A third problem is that there are too few health-care workers.
In many low- and middle-income countries, patients cannot get the drugs they need simply because there are no doctors or nurses to prescribe them, nor pharmacists to dispense them.
According to the WHO, the world suffers from a deficit of some seven million health-care professionals; by 2035, that number is expected to reach 13 million.
Making matters worse, there is an even greater shortfall of specialists equipped to treat chronic diseases such as diabetes, which is spreading rapidly through the developing world, owing to changing diets and habits.
Flawed – or nonexistent – health-finance schemes are the fourth, and perhaps the largest, barrier to drug delivery in many countries.
Even when generic-brand essential medicines are available, they often are unaffordable for low-income patients in countries with scant state subsidies and no risk-pooling insurance mechanisms.
By one estimate, almost 90% of people in low- and middle-income countries will face impoverishment if they have to pay out of pocket for a single commonly used generic drug.
Some of the countries that are most eager to strip patent protections are also notorious for skimping on health-care expenditures.
The Indian government, for example, spends just around 1% of GDP on health care, well below the 5% needed to move toward universal health coverage.
But expropriating drug makers’ intellectual property will do nothing to improve outcomes where crucial safety nets are missing.
Increasing the availability of essential medicines is imperative for improving health-care outcomes for hundreds of millions of people around the world.
When societies are not burdened by disease, they can focus on boosting productivity, consumption, and trade.
At the same time, neglecting the threat posed by communicable diseases in the developing world invites catastrophe not just in those countries, but in developed economies, too.
We can do much to close the global health-security gap; but undermining patent protections for new drugs will do precisely the opposite.
The Right to Health Is Universal
GENEVA – On this year’s World AIDS Day, on December 1, we should remember the 35 million people who have died of AIDS-related illnesses, and the 76 million who have been infected with HIV since reporting began.
And we can celebrate the fact that nearly 21 million people living with HIV now have access to life-saving treatment.
But we also must not lose sight of the fact that more than 15.8 million people are still awaiting treatment, while an estimated 11 million people do not even know they have the virus.
In the time it takes to read this commentary, three more young women will have contracted HIV.
These figures represent an indefensible injustice: millions of people are being denied their right to health.
The third United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG3) addresses health.
It aims to reduce road accidents; tackle non-communicable diseases; end AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, and neglected tropical diseases; guarantee universal health coverage and access to sexual and reproductive health-care services; and substantially reduce deaths from environmental pollution – all by 2030.
Although countries around the world have committed to this goal, countless people still inhale dangerous levels of toxic particles, and lack access to safe water and adequate sanitation.
Too many governments consistently fail to act on environmental and other regulatory issues, turn a blind eye to companies that profit from selling unhealthy and addictive products, and thus fail those whom they are supposed to protect and serve.
Health is neither a gift nor an act of charity.
It is a fundamental human right, encompassing both freedoms and entitlements.
Everyone is free to make decisions about their health, regardless of who they are, where they live, what they believe, or how they earn a living.
And everyone is entitled to affordable, quality health services and freedom from discrimination and coercion.
Enjoying the right to health means having one’s physical and mental integrity respected, and having the ability to participate and contribute to one’s community.
Today, we call on world leaders to confront health injustices wherever they see them, and to take action to respect, protect, and uphold the right to health for all people.
The ambitious SDG agenda for 2030 has afforded all of us the opportunity to shape policies aimed at creating and empowering the “global health citizen.”
Who is this citizen?
She is an individual who knows her rights and can voice her concerns, challenge injustices, and hold decision-makers accountable.
He is an individual who does not just ask for but demands access to doctors, treatments, or preventive care.
The global health citizen is one who becomes a part of the solution.
Empowering global health citizens will require progress in at least three policy areas: popularizing participation, democratizing data, and eliminating discrimination.
As to the first, we must open up health programs and policies to meaningful public engagement.
In the 1990s, the disability-rights movement coined the phrase, “Nothing about us without us.”
All global health citizens, and particularly health-care leaders, should adopt this mantra.
To be sure, public and private corruption remains a significant obstacle to ensuring the right to health for all people.
In many countries, health care is one of the most corrupt sectors.
To address this, global health citizens will need both institutional support and better tools for demanding that their right to health be respected.
They should start demanding more measures to ensure good governance and transparency, improve “legal” literacy, fund civil-society organizations, and reinforce legal mechanisms for holding governments accountable.
The second policy area where progress is needed is access to data for every community.
At UNAIDS, we follow the adage, “What gets measured gets done.”
Data analysis has proven to be one of the most potent tools in the fight against the HIV epidemic, because it enables us to raise awareness, identify people being left behind, guide investment, and coordinate action.
We in the global health field have always been good at estimating mortality and morbidity rates.
But it is now time to look beyond epidemiological facts.
Guaranteeing the right to health will require us also to monitor the effects of discrimination and stigmatization, as well as laws and environmental factors that threaten people’s health and wellbeing.
Likewise, conducting thorough assessments of the health impact of key policies and investments must become the norm, rather than the exception.
The global health sector needs far more independent advocacy and accountability, which the UN and civil-society groups, in particular, are in a strong position to provide.
The third policy area – eliminating discrimination in health-care settings – must become an international priority.
The central promise of the SDG agenda is to leave no one behind.
Discrimination creates de facto barriers to universal health coverage, and prevents many people from accessing health services of any kind.
For example, one in eight people responding to the HIV Stigma Index say they have been denied health care as a result of prejudice.
It is clear that ending AIDS will require social – not just medical – breakthroughs.
Governments must redouble their efforts to protect individuals against discrimination, and create effective mechanisms for people to seek redress when private or state actors violate their right to health.
We call on all health-care practitioners and institutions to resist discriminatory laws, policies, or practices.
Safeguarding the right to health provides the foundation needed to enable everyone to realize their potential and their dreams.
We should demand nothing less.
Monopoly’s New Era
NEW YORK – For 200 years, there have been two schools of thought about what determines the distribution of income – and how the economy functions.
One, emanating from Adam Smith and nineteenth-century liberal economists, focuses on competitive markets.
The other, cognizant of how Smith’s brand of liberalism leads to rapid concentration of wealth and income, takes as its starting point unfettered markets’ tendency toward monopoly.
It is important to understand both, because our views about government policies and existing inequalities are shaped by which of the two schools of thought one believes provides a better description of reality.
For the nineteenth-century liberals and their latter-day acolytes, because markets are competitive, individuals’ returns are related to their social contributions – their “marginal product,” in the language of economists.
Capitalists are rewarded for saving rather than consuming – for their abstinence, in the words of Nassau Senior, one of my predecessors in the Drummond Professorship of Political Economy at Oxford.
Differences in income were then related to their ownership of “assets” – human and financial capital.
Scholars of inequality thus focused on the determinants of the distribution of assets, including how they are passed on across generations.
The second school of thought takes as its starting point “power,” including the ability to exercise monopoly control or, in labor markets, to assert authority over workers.
Scholars in this area have focused on what gives rise to power, how it is maintained and strengthened, and other features that may prevent markets from being competitive.
Work on exploitation arising from asymmetries of information is an important example.
In the West in the post-World War II era, the liberal school of thought has dominated.
Yet, as inequality has widened and concerns about it have grown, the competitive school, viewing individual returns in terms of marginal product, has become increasingly unable to explain how the economy works.
So, today, the second school of thought is ascendant.
After all, the large bonuses paid to banks’ CEOs as they led their firms to ruin and the economy to the brink of collapse are hard to reconcile with the belief that individuals’ pay has anything to do with their social contributions.
Of course, historically, the oppression of large groups – slaves, women, and minorities of various types – are obvious instances where inequalities are the result of power relationships, not marginal returns.
In today’s economy, many sectors – telecoms, cable TV, digital branches from social media to Internet search, health insurance, pharmaceuticals, agro-business, and many more – cannot be understood through the lens of competition.
In these sectors, what competition exists is oligopolistic, not the “pure” competition depicted in textbooks.
A few sectors can be defined as “price taking”; firms are so small that they have no effect on market price.
Agriculture is the clearest example, but government intervention in the sector is massive, and prices are not set primarily by market forces.
US President Barack Obama’s Council of Economic Advisers, led by Jason Furman, has attempted to tally the extent of the increase in market concentration and some of its implications.
In most industries, according to the CEA, standard metrics show large – and in some cases, dramatic – increases in market concentration.
The top ten banks’ share of the deposit market, for example, increased from about 20% to 50% in just 30 years, from 1980 to 2010.
Some of the increase in market power is the result of changes in technology and economic structure: consider network economies and the growth of locally provided service-sector industries.
Some is because firms – Microsoft and drug companies are good examples – have learned better how to erect and maintain entry barriers, often assisted by conservative political forces that justify lax anti-trust enforcement and the failure to limit market power on the grounds that markets are “naturally” competitive.
And some of it reflects the naked abuse and leveraging of market power through the political process: Large banks, for example, lobbied the US Congress to amend or repeal legislation separating commercial banking from other areas of finance.
The consequences are evident in the data, with inequality rising at every level, not only across individuals, but also across firms.
The CEA report noted that the “90th percentile firm sees returns on investments in capital that are more than five times the median.
This ratio was closer to two just a quarter of a century ago.”
Joseph Schumpeter, one of the great economists of the twentieth century, argued that one shouldn’t be worried by monopoly power: monopolies would only be temporary.
There would be fierce competition for the market and this would replace competition in the market and ensure that prices remained competitive.
My own theoretical work long ago showed the flaws in Schumpeter’s analysis, and now empirical results provide strong confirmation.
Today’s markets are characterized by the persistence of high monopoly profits.
The implications of this are profound.
Many of the assumptions about market economies are based on acceptance of the competitive model, with marginal returns commensurate with social contributions.
This view has led to hesitancy about official intervention: If markets are fundamentally efficient and fair, there is little that even the best of governments could do to improve matters.
But if markets are based on exploitation, the rationale for laissez-faire disappears.
Indeed, in that case, the battle against entrenched power is not only a battle for democracy; it is also a battle for efficiency and shared prosperity.
The Rising Price of Trump’s Border Wall
WASHINGTON, DC – As a candidate, Donald Trump insisted on one signature issue above all: the United States will build a wall along its border with Mexico, and Mexico will pay for it.
Seven months after taking office, however, Trump has made no progress on either front: political support for a new wall is diminishing, and the chance that Mexico will pay anything for it is essentially zero and seems to be off the agenda.
Now, Trump is doubling down – and threatening to shut down the government, or even default on the federal debt, unless Congress provides funding for a wall that he promised would cost US taxpayers nothing.
If Trump escalates this confrontation, the costs for Americans – in terms of economic uncertainty and slower growth – are likely to pile up.
The amounts of money involved are not large relative to the overall size of the US government.
In Trump’s first full-year budget, initial spending on the wall was put at $1.6 billion, with the president estimating that the total cost will be $12 billion (although other estimates are considerably higher).
Compared to total US government spending of $3.9 trillion in 2016, that is a drop in the bucket.
The argument here is about principles: what would a border wall really achieve from a practical standpoint, and what would it symbolize?
But the precise rules about purse strings determine how this argument will play out.
The president does have some discretion on spending – and the Department of Homeland Security has already shifted funds from other programs to pay for the development of prototypes.
But a fundamental principle of the US Constitution is that Congress controls the purse strings – meaning that discretionary spending, such as outlays for a border wall, is subject to the formal appropriations process.
Building a border wall, or significantly extending what is already there, is not feasible without congressional approval.
The appropriations process is complex and not always transparent to outsiders.
Regular appropriations are supposed to be enacted by October 1 (the beginning of the government’s fiscal year).
But there is now a long tradition of “continuing resolutions,” which provide funding for just part of a year.
And supplemental appropriations bills can provide additional funding at any time in response to particular situations – such as the aftermath of a major hurricane.
The Republicans control both the Senate and the House of Representatives.
And the House already granted approval for exactly what Trump wanted on the wall – the $1.6 billion was included in a broader $788 billion spending package, so the wall did not have to be debated separately.
Under current rules, 60 votes would be needed in the 100-member Senate to fund the wall, and the Democrats, with 48 seats, already managed to exclude this item from the spending bill earlier this year, which funded the government through September 30.
Now Trump has issued an ultimatum: fund the wall, or face a shutdown of the federal government – meaning that he and the Republicans would refuse to conclude any appropriations deal by October 1.
Or perhaps the wall will become part of a showdown over how the debt ceiling for the federal government should be raised, with the deadline for doing so also likely to come around the end of September.
Complicating the issue further, some congressional Republicans – such as Senator Paul Rand of Kentucky and Congressman Mark Meadows of North Carolina – seem not to oppose some form of partial default or other reneging on debt by the US government.
And remember that John Boehner stepped down as Speaker of the House in 2015 in part over similar budget struggles with the right wing of his party.
The impact of a debt default would be cataclysmic, and it seems unlikely that Trump would be foolish enough to go so far.
But Goldman Sachs, a politically well-connected bank, puts the odds of a government shutdown at 50/50 – up from around 30% in May.
Government shutdowns are costly, impacting services and potentially payments to suppliers and citizens.
But politicians never know exactly who will be blamed, and how much, until the shutdown happens.
Although this approach didn’t go well for Republicans in 1995-96 or in 2013, there are clearly some people in the party who would like to try it again.
The costs to the economy of a shutdown are definitely negative.
But, whereas a debt default by the federal government would amount to falling off a cliff, the costs of a shutdown build more gradually over time.
It seems entirely consistent with Trump’s personality and style that he would try such a maneuver and see how it plays with his (slowly dwindling) electoral base.
Of course, there are many wildcards – including the apparently bad relationship between Trump and Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader in the Senate.
The massive flooding in Texas – and the important helping role that the federal government can play – may also convince the White House that now is not the time for further disruption.
One thing is certain: Mexico is not going to pay for the border wall.
What is less clear is how much Americans will be forced to pay – with uncertainty, disruption, and even a government shutdown – if Trump’s version of the wall is ever built.
The Moral Identity of Homo Economicus
CAMBRIDGE – Why do people vote, if doing so is costly and highly unlikely to affect the outcome?
Why do people go above and beyond the call of duty at their jobs?
Two recent books – Identity Economics by Nobel laureate George Akerlof and Rachel Kranton and The Moral Economy by Sam Bowles – indicate that a quiet revolution is challenging the foundations of the dismal science, promising radical changes in how we view many aspects of organizations, public policy, and even social life.
As with the rise of behavioral economics (which already includes six Nobel laureates among its leaders), this revolution emanates from psychology.
But while behavioral economics relies on cognitive psychology, this one is rooted in moral psychology.
As with most revolutions, this one is not happening because, as Thomas Huxley surmised, a beautiful old theory has been killed by ugly new facts.
The ugly facts have been apparent for a while, but people cannot abandon one mental framework unless another one can take its place: in the end, beautiful old theories are killed only by newer, more powerful theories.
For a long time, economic theory aspired to the elegance of Euclidean geometry, where all true statements can be derived from five apparently incontrovertible axioms, such as the notion that there is only one line that connects two points in space.
In the nineteenth century, mathematicians explored the consequences of relaxing one of those axioms and discovered the geometries of curved spaces, where an infinite number of longitudinal lines can pass through the poles of a sphere.
The axioms underpinning traditional economics embody a view of human behavior known as homo economicus: we choose among the available options that which we want or prefer the most.
But what makes us want or prefer something?
Economics has long assumed that whatever informs our preferences is exogenous to the issue at hand: de gustibus non est disputandum, as George Stigler and Gary Becker argued.
But with a few reasonable assumptions, such as the idea that more is better than less, you can make many predictions about how people will behave.
The behavioral economics revolution questioned the idea that we are good at making these judgments.
In the process, they subjected the assumptions underlying homo economicus to experimental tests and found them wanting.
But this led at most to the idea of nudging people into better decisions, such as forcing them to opt out of rather than into better choices.
The new revolution may have been triggered by an uncomfortable finding of the old one.
Consider the so-called ultimatum game, in which a player is given a sum of money, say, $100.
He must offer a share of that money to a second player.
If the latter accepts the offer, both get to keep the money.
If not, they both get nothing.
Homo economicus would give $1 to the second player, who should accept the offer, because $1 is better than zero dollars.
But people throughout the world tend to reject offers below $30.
Why?
The new revolution assumes that when we make choices, we do not merely consider which of the available options we like the most.
We are also asking ourselves what we ought to do.
In fact, according to moral psychology, our moral sentiments, on which Adam Smith wrote his other famous book, evolved to regulate behavior.
We are the most cooperative species on earth because our feelings evolved to sustain cooperation, to put “us” before “me.”
These feelings include guilt, shame, outrage, empathy, sympathy, dread, disgust, and a whole cocktail of other sentiments.
We reject offers in the ultimatum game because we feel they are unfair.
Akerlof and Kranton propose a simple addition to the conventional economic model of human behavior.
Besides the standard selfish elements that define our preferences, they argue that people see themselves as members of “social categories” with which they identify.
Each of these social categories – for example, being a Christian, a father, a mason, a neighbor, or a sportsman – has an associated norm or ideal.
And, because people derive satisfaction from behaving in accordance with the ideal, they behave not just to acquire, but also to become.
Bowles shows that we have distinct frameworks for analyzing situations.
In particular, giving people monetary incentives may work in market-like situations.
But, as a now-famous study of Haifa daycare centers showed, imposing fines on people who picked up their kids late actually had the opposite effect: if a fine is like a price, people may find that it is a price worth paying.
But without the fine, coming late constitutes impolite, rude, or disrespectful behavior toward the caregivers, which self-respecting people would avoid, even without fines.
Unfortunately, this other-regarding view of behavior has been de-emphasized both in the corporate and the public domain.
Instead, strategies have been derived from the view that all our behaviors are selfish, with the intellectual challenge being to design “incentive-compatible” mechanisms or contracts, an effort that has also been recognized with Nobel Prizes.
But, as George Price showed long ago, Darwinian evolution may have made us altruistic, at least toward people we perceive as members of the group we call “us.”
The new revolution in economics may find a place for strategies based on affecting ideals and identities, not just taxes and subsidies.
In the process, we may understand that we vote because that is what citizens ought to do, and we excel at our jobs because we strive for respect and self-realization, not just a raise.
If successful, the new revolution may lead to strategies that make us more responsive to our better angels.
Economics and our view of human behavior need not be dismal.
It may even become inspirational.
Keep Hong Kong Free
HONG KONG – Visiting Hong Kong is a true pleasure.
With its modern architecture towering around the busy harbor, that great and exciting city must rank among the world’s most enjoyable urban destinations.
But Hong Kong is now under stress, as it finds itself at the center of a number of issues and challenges – including how best to balance economic and political freedom and how to engage with an increasingly assertive and ambitious China – that will define its prospects in the century ahead.
Fundamentally, Hong Kong’s prospects depend on the implementation of the “one country, two systems” principle, conceived by Deng Xiaoping to serve as the basis for Hong Kong’s eventual return to China in 1997.
The idea – which Milton Friedman thought amounted to an impossible balancing act – was that Hong Kong would keep its way of life, liberties, and laws.
Its people were perfectly capable of running their city; they simply had to do so as a part of China.
One country, two systems brilliantly balanced the aspirations, anxieties, and difficulties posed by the change in sovereignty from Britain to China.
For China, there was the smarting humiliation of having ceded its own territory to a colonial power during the Qing dynasty.
Imperialists from all over the world gave China a hard time, behaving in a way that no one today would or should seek to justify.
Forcing China to open up to the opium trade formed one of the most disreputable chapters in Britain’s imperial history.
But what must have rankled the Chinese Communist Party most was that the colonial power had been so successful in building, with China’s own people in Hong Kong, a hugely prosperous and contented city – one that became a magnet for many Chinese men, women, and children.
If Chinese communism was the wave of the future, why did so many flee from it, clambering over fences topped with razor wire and swimming through hazardous waters, to live under colonial rule?
On the British side, there were equally implacable challenges.
Britain needed to determine how best to establish a constructive relationship with a China intent on weaponizing trade, while standing up for the rights and promised freedoms of Hong Kong’s people.
In this respect, the handover raised essential and complex questions about political morality.
Just before I left Hong Kong in 1997, after departing from my post as the city’s last British governor, I visited a hospital for the mentally ill, where an in-patient asked me an eminently sane question.
How, he wanted to know, could a country that prided itself on its deeply rooted democracy hand Hong Kong over to the world’s last big Communist tyranny, without asking its citizens for their opinion?
The answer is that such questions were never an option, if we were to fulfill our treaty obligations and avoid a catastrophic repeat of nineteenth-century colonialism.
Yet we should certainly have done as much to introduce and entrench democratic institutions in Hong Kong as we did to secure the rule of law and the protection of civil liberties.
One reason why we moved more slowly on democracy was that China’s leaders had made clear that they feared Hong Kong’s people would think the road was being cleared to become an independent state, like Singapore.
For the first few years after 1997, “one country, two systems” seemed to work pretty well, though China did break its promises by blocking democratic development.
But more recently – and especially since 2012, when President Xi Jinping came to power – China has been tightening its grip on Hong Kong.
This is probably related to the government’s broader crackdown on dissidents; China’s growing economic heft, which makes an open Hong Kong seem less important to its future prosperity; and a lack of understanding of what Hong Kong’s system really means.
The question now is whether “one country, two systems” will devolve into “one country, one and a half systems” or, worse, “one country, one system.”
There is no doubt that China has increasingly been interfering in Hong Kong’s domestic affairs.
Most recently, concerns have focused on the treatment of some of the leaders of Hong Kong’s 2014 pro-democracy demonstrations: three of the city’s most influential activists were sentenced to up to eight months in prison for their activities, and have been prohibited from seeking public office for five years.
Three years may seem like a long time to wait before cracking the whip, but there is no doubt that Hong Kong’s judicial system has acted according to the law.
The trouble is that the convictions have taken place against a background of fear and divisiveness, stoked by the Chinese government’s behavior.
China has, for example, attacked the independence of Hong Kong’s judiciary, with Rimsky Yuen, Secretary for Justice of Hong Kong, calling for the review of already-served sentences that he deems too lenient.
And, even as officials like Yuen purport to be defending the rule of law, Chinese security operatives have apparently abducted Hong Kong residents, including several booksellers.
To ease fears and allow Hong Kong to move forward, three things are required.
First, China must make clear through its actions that it can be trusted to keep its promises to Hong Kong.
To help ensure that outcome, the international community should vigorously remind it of the broader ramifications of being viewed as an untrustworthy partner.
Second, democracy activists in Hong Kong should not allow their campaign for democracy to morph into a call for independence.
For its part, the government should open a dialogue with them, characterized by mutual respect and transparency.
Finally, the people of Hong Kong should not give up hope, as the Chinese communists hope they will.
If its people remain resolute in their commitment, Hong Kong will remain a great free city, choosing those who govern it under the rule of law.
Hong Kong is a shining example to the rest of the world about what Chinese men and women can achieve with the sort of freedom that millions of others take for granted.
Its people must not – and, I believe, will not – give up on it.
Hoping for the Best Against Trump
NEW YORK – Is there any reason for liberals to feel optimistic after a year of political disasters?
Is there even a shred of silver lining to be found in the tatters of Brexit, Donald Trump’s election, and European disunity?
Christians believe that despair is a mortal sin, so one might as well try to find a glimmer of hope.
In the United States, many liberals console themselves with the belief that the obvious dangers of being governed by an ignorant, narcissistic, authoritarian loudmouth backed by billionaires, ex-generals, peddlers of malicious fake news, and neophytes with extreme views will help to galvanize a strong political opposition.
Trump, it is hoped, will concentrate the minds of all who still believe in liberal democracy, be they left or even right of center.
In this scenario, civil-rights groups, NGOs, students, human-rights activists, Democratic members of Congress, and even some Republicans, will do everything in their power to push back against Trump's worst impulses.
Long-dormant political activism will erupt into mass protest, with resurgent liberal idealism breaking the wave of right-wing populism.
Well, perhaps.
Others seek comfort in the expectation that Trump’s wildly contradictory plans – lower taxes, while raising infrastructure spending; helping the neglected working class, while slashing welfare and repealing the Affordable Care Act – will suck his administration into a swamp of infighting, incoherence, and incompetence.
All these things might happen.
But protest alone won’t be of much help.
Anti-Trump demonstrations in big cities will no doubt annoy the self-loving new president, and the moral glow of joining the resistance will warm the protesters.
But without real political organization, mere protest will go the way of Occupy Wall Street in 2011; it will peter out into ineffectual gestures.
One of the most dangerous ideas of contemporary populism is that political parties are obsolete, and should be replaced by movements led by charismatic leaders who act as the voice of “the people.”
By implication, all dissenters are enemies of the people.
That way lies dictatorship.
Liberal democracy can be saved only if mainstream parties can regain voters’ trust.
The Democratic Party must get its act together.
“Feeling the Bern” (the mantra of Bernie Sanders’ leftist campaign) will not suffice to stop Trump from inflicting great harm to institutions that were carefully constructed more than two centuries ago to protect American democracy from demagogues like him.
The same thing is true of international arrangements and institutions, whose survival depends on the willingness to defend them.
Trump has expressed his indifference to NATO, and US security commitments in East Asia.
His election will further erode Pax Americana, already battered by a succession of foolish wars.
Without the US guarantee to protect its democratic allies, institutions built after World War II to provide that protection would not survive for very long.
Perhaps there is a tiny ray of hope in this gloomy prospect.
Europe and Japan, not to mention South Korea, have become too dependent on US military protection.
The Japanese have fairly large armed forces, but are hampered by a pacifist constitution written by Americans in 1946.
Europeans are completely unprepared to defend themselves, owing to inertia, complacency, and lassitude.
It is just possible that Trump’s blustering “America first” rhetoric will galvanize Europeans and East Asians into changing the status quo and doing more for their own security.
Ideally, European countries should build an integrated defense force that would be less dependent on the US.
And the countries of Southeast and East Asia could construct a Japanese-led variant of NATO to balance the domineering might of China.
But even if these arrangements came to pass (a huge if), it would not happen soon.
Europeans are unwilling to pay higher taxes for their own defense.
Germany has neither the wherewithal, nor the will to lead a military alliance.
And most Asians, including many Japanese, would not trust Japan to lead such a coalition in Asia.
The current Japanese government, under Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, would like to revise the pacifist constitution, as a necessary first step toward weaning the country off its total dependence on the US.
But Abe’s revisionism is rooted in a nationalist ideology, which is prone to justifying historical atrocities instead of drawing lessons from them.
This alone disqualifies Japan from leading others in a military pact.
So, while it might be time to rethink the world order built by the US on the ruins of WWII, the Trump presidency is unlikely to bring this about in a careful and orderly manner.
His election is more like an earthquake, unleashing forces no one can control.
Instead of encouraging the Japanese to think about collective security in a responsible way, Trump's indifference is more likely to play to the worst instincts of panicky Japanese nationalists.
Europe is in no shape to rise to the challenge of Pax Americana’s erosion, either.
Without a greater sense of pan-national European solidarity, European institutions will soon become hollow, and perhaps even cease to exist.
But this sense is precisely what the demagogues are now undermining with such conspicuous success.
If there is reason for confidence, it is not in the liberal democratic world, but in the capitals of its most powerful adversaries: Moscow and Beijing.
Trump, at least in the short term, seems to be good news for Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping.
Without credible American leadership, or a strong alliance of democracies, there won’t be much left to restrain Russian or Chinese ambitions.
This might not lead to catastrophe in the next few years.
Russia and China are more likely to test the limits of their power slowly, bit by bit: Ukraine today, perhaps the Baltics tomorrow; the South China Sea islands now, Taiwan later.
They will push, and push, until they push too far.
Then anything may happen.
Great powers often blunder into great wars.
This is no reason for despair, as we begin the New Year, but no reason to be optimistic, either.
How to End Hunger
ISTANBUL/KUALA LUMPUR – Last September, world leaders made a commitment to end hunger by 2030, as part of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
It sounds like a massive undertaking.
In fact, the world already produces enough food to feed everyone.
So why does the problem persist?
Poverty and hunger are intimately connected, which is why the SDGs target elimination of both.
For someone living at the World Bank’s poverty line of $1.90 per day, food would account for some 50-70% of income.
The Bank estimates that almost four-fifths of the world’s poor live in rural areas, though those areas account for less than half of the world’s population.
The obvious conclusion is that raising rural incomes sustainably is required to eradicate hunger.
That will not be easy.
Most developing countries nowadays are burdened by high rates of unemployment and underemployment.
And with current economic prospects bleak, especially given low commodity prices, and insistence on fiscal austerity continuing in most places, downward pressure on rural incomes is likely to worsen.
But even if countries do manage to achieve inclusive growth, it will not be enough to eliminate hunger by 2030.
The only way to do that will be to implement well-designed social protection and scale up pro-poor investments.
According to the World Bank, one billion people in 146 low- and middle-income countries currently receive some form of social protection.
Yet 870 million of those living in extreme poverty, mainly in rural areas, lack coverage.
Unsurprisingly, the greatest shortfalls are in low-income countries, where social protection covers less than one-tenth of the population, 47% of which lives in extreme poverty.
In the lower-middle-income countries, social protection reaches about a quarter of those living in extreme poverty, leaving about a half-billion people without coverage.
In the upper middle-income countries, about 45% of those living in extreme poverty receive social-welfare benefits.
This is clearly not good enough.
Improved social protection can help to ensure adequate food consumption and enable recipients to invest in their own nutrition, health, and other productive capacities.
As such investments sustainably raise incomes, they enable further increases in productive personal investments, thereby breaking the vicious cycle of poverty and hunger.
Governments, too, have investments to make, in order to ensure that those who are currently mired in poverty reach the point where they can invest in themselves.
An early big investment push would generate additional incomes sooner, reducing longer-term financing costs.
Moreover, it would boost aggregate demand in a world economy that badly needs it.
The world can afford the needed investment.
According to estimates by the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO), the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), and the World Food Programme (WFP), it would cost the equivalent of 0.3% of the world’s 2014 income.
All that is needed is for wealthier countries to provide budgetary support and technical assistance to the low-income countries that need it.
(Most middle-income countries can afford the needed financing themselves.)
It should not be difficult to generate the political will to provide the needed support, at least in theory.
After all, it has been more than a half-century since the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and its Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights, which treats the material needs of all persons as a fundamental human right.
A few years earlier, US President Franklin D. Roosevelt called “freedom from want” – which, presumably, includes freedom from hunger – one of four essential freedoms of which people “everywhere in the world” should be assured.
Now, with the adoption of the SDGs, governments everywhere are obliged to take responsibility for ending poverty and hunger, as well as for creating the conditions for ensuring that both are permanently overcome.
The upcoming High-Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development presents an important opportunity to forge the path ahead, setting near- and medium-term priorities.
Ending hunger and poverty in a sustainable way is morally right, politically beneficial, and economically feasible.
For world leaders, inaction is no longer an option.
How Fake News Wins
WASHINGTON, DC – In response to the wave of fake news that inundated the recent presidential election campaign in the United States, much attention has been devoted to those who produce or spread those stories.
The assumption is that if news outlets were to report only the “facts,” readers and viewers would always reach the right conclusion about a given story.
But this approach addresses only half of the equation.
Yes, we need news organizations to deliver reliable information; but we also need those receiving it to be savvy consumers.
For decades, the US government has supported programs to foster independent media in authoritarian, resource-deprived, or dysfunctional countries.
But these programs tacitly assume that the US itself is immune to the problems people in other countries encounter when they create or consume information.
We in the US also assume that American media, sustained by advertising, will continue to thrive; that independent journalism is the norm; and that most people are capable of thinking critically and making sound judgments about the information they receive.
In fact, some of the lessons that we have learned while supporting vibrant information gathering and distribution abroad are equally relevant to the US.
In the 2016 election, the personal beliefs that drove millions of voters’ decisions were based not only on each person’s experiences and the information they accessed, but also on how they processed those experiences and that information.
Voters’ own relationships with content producers, their motivation to believe or disbelieve facts, and their critical thinking skills all determined how they interpreted and acted on information.
In the election, most mainstream pundits did not seem to “get” millions of Americans’ beliefs or viewpoints, so it is little wonder that those millions of Americans were turned off by the pundits’ incessant chatter.
To these voters, the pundits were simply information peddlers with no attachments to the issues that matter.
Men and women talking in front of TV cameras are too far removed from the factories, offices, bars, churches, schools, and hospitals where viewers form the relationships that determine how they process information.
The so-called digital revolution did not render superfluous the importance of human connection in shaping people’s interpretation and response to the information they receive.
Relationships are built on trust, which is essential for ensuring that consumers accept information that challenges their closely held beliefs.
But, according to Gallup, only 32% of Americans have a “great deal” or “fair amount” of trust in traditional media outlets – an all-time low.
That is deeply problematic, and it suggests that many citizens are throwing out the good information with the bad.
As with any other good, how information is consumed reflects economic and political opportunities, personal incentives, and institutional or cultural norms.
Workers in Ohio whose wages have stagnated, or unemployed voters in Michigan whose jobs have migrated overseas, will consume information in a way that reflects their economic situation.
Not surprisingly, they will often select sources – whether credible or not – that are critical of globalization and current fiscal and economic policies.
An ample supply of sound information is not sufficient to make good choices; news consumers need critical-thinking skills.
Information is much like the food we eat: we need to understand its ingredients, and where and how it is produced, and the effects of overconsumption.
It will probably take decades to rebuild trusting relationships between consumers and mainstream news media.
Information consumers will always have biases and incentives to select one piece of information over another.
Even so, we can improve critical-thinking skills so that citizens know how to pick trustworthy sources, and resist their own biases.
Cultivating critical-thinking skills takes time and practice, which is why it is more important than ever to invest in education.
Some of the models that have been used abroad may work in the US, too.
For example, in Ukraine, a recent initiative carried out by IREX mobilized librarians in an effort to neutralize the detrimental effects of Kremlin-funded propaganda.
Fifteen thousand Ukrainians were taught concrete skills in avoiding emotional manipulation, verifying sources and credentials, detecting paid content and hate speech, and debunking fake videos and photos.
The results were impressive: participants improved their ability to distinguish trustworthy news from false news by 24%.
Better yet, they then trained hundreds more people to detect disinformation, thus multiplying the initiative’s overall impact.
With a rather modest investment, we can make teaching these skills a standard practice in school curricula.
Philanthropists can also create or support grassroots organizations that work with citizens to strengthen their ability to consume information critically.
Accurate information and critical-thinking skills are indispensable to democracy.
We cannot take them for granted, even in America.
That is how fake news wins.
Counting What Counts in Development
NEW YORK – To most people, “development” is best measured by the quantity of change – like gains in average income, life expectancy, or years spent in school.
The Human Development Index (HDI), a composite measure of national progress that my office at the United Nations Development Programme oversees, combines all three statistics to rank countries relative to one another.
What many do not realize, however, is that such metrics, while useful, do not tell the entire story of development.
In fact, to understand how developed a country is, we must also grasp how people’s lives are affected by progress.
And to understand that, we must consider the quality of the change that is being reported.
When statisticians compare countries, they require commensurate data.
To compare school attendance, for example, researchers would count the number of registered students in each country, relative to all school-age children (although even this can be a challenge in many developing countries, where record keeping is not always standardized).
But to gauge the relative quality of a country’s education system, researchers would want to determine whether students are actually learning.
For those numbers, statisticians would need to test students across a range of subjects, a project that is far more ambitious than simply taking attendance.
Statisticians have always recognized that comparing quantities is far easier than comparing quality.
But, because existing measures are all we have, the weaknesses are often overlooked when ranking relative gains or making policies, even though “progress” according to a given indicator is not necessarily genuine.
If the world is ever to reach parity in development, we must change how we gauge and catalogue the quality of policy initiatives.
Consider the statistics measured by the HDI – life expectancy, education, and per capita income.
Life expectancy statistics suggest that the world is getting healthier, and data show that people are living longer than ever before; since 1990, average life expectancy has increased by around six years.
But the increase in quality of life has not been as dramatic.
Those extra years are often accompanied by illness and disability – such as dementia, which the World Health Organization now estimates affects 47.5 million people worldwide.
While life expectancy can be calculated based on birth and death records, indices that measure quality of life, like the WHO’s disability-adjusted life year estimates, require considerable amounts of information on a wide range of illnesses and disabilities in every country.
And, unfortunately, the difficulty of gathering such data means that many life-quality datasets are incomplete or infrequently compiled.
It’s a similarly mixed picture for education.
The world is no doubt making progress in extending access to schools, with more children are enrolled and attending than ever before.
But how do we measure the gaps in educational quality?
Some 250 million children worldwide do not learn basic skills, even though half of them have spent at least four years in school.
It will come as no surprise that in most countries, schools in wealthier neighborhoods typically have better facilities, more qualified teachers, and smaller class sizes.
Addressing inequality requires measuring educational outcomes, rather than school enrollment rates.
The OECD’s Program for International Student Assessment (PISA), which relies on tests not directly linked to curricula, is one approach to making cross-country comparisons.
The results for 2015 paint a much richer picture of educational performance across participating countries, while highlighting stark disparities.
For example, PISA found that “socio-economically disadvantaged students across OECD countries are almost three times more likely than advantaged students not to attain the baseline level of proficiency in science.”
Data on employment – critical for policymakers, as they prepare for the future – tell a similar story.
The 2015 Human Development Report recognized that as the world moves toward a knowledge economy, low-skill or marginal workers are at greater risk of losing their jobs, and opportunities for exploitation of informal or unpaid workers increase.
To put this in perspective, consider employment projections for the European Union, which foresee the addition of 16 million new jobs between 2010 and 2020.
But over the same period, the number of jobs available for people with the least formal education is anticipated to decline, by around 12 million.
“Not everything that can be counted counts.
Not everything that counts can be counted,” the sociologist William Bruce Cameron wrote in 1963.
His dictum remains true today, though when it comes to measuring human development, I would suggest a slight revision: “Not everything that is counted counts for everything.”
Equitable human development requires that policymakers pay more attention to the quality of outcomes, rather than focusing primarily on quantitative measures of change.
Only when we know how people are being affected by development can we design policies that bring about the most valuable improvements in their lives.
“The intention to live as long as possible isn’t one of the mind’s best intentions,” the author Deepak Chopra once observed, “because quantity isn’t the same as quality.”
Charting Our AI Future
OXFORD – Galileo viewed nature as a book written in the language of mathematics and decipherable through physics.
His metaphor may have been a stretch for his milieu, but not for ours.
Ours is a world of digits that must be read through computer science.
It is a world in which artificial-intelligence (AI) applications perform many tasks better than we can.
Like fish in water, digital technologies are our infosphere’s true natives, while we analog organisms try to adapt to a new habitat, one that has come to include a mix of analog and digital components.
We are sharing the infosphere with artificial agents that are increasingly smart, autonomous, and even social.
Some of these agents are already right in front of us, and others are discernible on the horizon, while later generations are unforeseeable.
And the most profound implication of this epochal change may be that we are most likely only at the beginning of it.
The AI agents that have already arrived come in soft forms, such as apps, web bots, algorithms, and software of all kinds; and hard forms, such as robots, driverless cars, smart watches, and other gadgets.
They are replacing even white-collar workers, and performing functions that, just a few years ago, were considered off-limits for technological disruption: cataloguing images, translating documents, interpreting radiographs, flying drones, extracting new information from huge data sets, and so forth.
Digital technologies and automation have been replacing workers in agriculture and manufacturing for decades; now they are coming to the services sector.
More old jobs will continue to disappear, and while we can only guess at the scale of the coming disruption, we should assume that it will be profound.
Any job in which people serve as an interface – between, say, a GPS and a car, documents in different languages, ingredients and a finished dish, or symptoms and a corresponding disease – is now at risk.
But, at the same time, new jobs will appear, because we will need new interfaces between automated services, websites, AI applications, and so forth.
Someone will need to ensure that the AI service’s translations are accurate and reliable.
What’s more, many tasks will not be cost-effective for AI applications.
For example, Amazon’s Mechanical Turk program claims to give its customers “access to more than 500,000 workers from 190 countries,” and is marketed as a form of “artificial artificial intelligence.”
But as the repetition indicates, the human “Turks” are performing brainless tasks, and being paid pennies.
These workers are in no position to turn down a job.
The risk is that AI will only continue to polarize our societies – between haves and never-will-haves – if we do not manage its effects.
It is not hard to imagine a future social hierarchy that places a few patricians above both the machines and a massive new underclass of plebs.
Meanwhile, as jobs go, so will tax revenues; and it is unlikely that the companies profiting from AI will willingly step in to support adequate social-welfare programs for their former employees.
Instead, we will have to do something to make companies pay more, perhaps with a “robo-tax” on AI applications.
We should also consider legislation and regulations to keep certain jobs “human.”
Indeed, such measures are also why driverless trains are still rare, despite being more manageable than driverless taxis or buses.
Still, not all of AI’s implications for the future are so obvious.
Some old jobs will survive, even when a machine is doing most of the work: a gardener who delegates cutting the grass to a “smart” lawnmower will simply have more time to focus on other things, such as landscape design.
At the same time, other tasks will be delegated back to us to perform (for free) as users, such as in the self-checkout lane at the supermarket.
Another source of uncertainty concerns the point at which AI is no longer controlled by a guild of technicians and managers.
What will happen when AI becomes “democratized” and is available to billions of people on their smartphones or some other device?
For starters, AI applications’ smart behavior will challenge our intelligent behavior, because they will be more adaptable to the future infosphere.
A world where autonomous AI systems can predict and manipulate our choices will force us to rethink the meaning of freedom.
And we will have to rethink sociability as well, as artificial companions, holograms (or mere voices), 3D servants, or life-like sexbots provide attractive and possibly indistinguishable alternatives to human interaction.
It is unclear how all of this will play out, but we can rest assured that new artificial agents will not confirm the scaremongers’ warnings, or usher in a dystopian science-fiction scenario.
Brave New World is not coming to life, and the “Terminator” is not lurking just beyond the horizon, either.
We should remember that AI is almost an oxymoron: future smart technologies will be as stupid as your old car.
In fact, delegating sensitive tasks to such “stupid” agents is one of the future risks.
All of these profound transformations oblige us to reflect seriously on who we are, could be, and would like to become.
AI will challenge the exalted status we have conferred on our species.
While I do not think that we are wrong to consider ourselves exceptional, I suspect that AI will help us identify the irreproducible, strictly human elements of our existence, and make us realize that we are exceptional only insofar as we are successfully dysfunctional.
In the great software of the universe, we will remain a beautiful bug, and AI will increasingly become a normal feature.
The Hungarian Government’s Failed Campaign of Lies
NEW YORK – In October, Hungary’s government mailed questionnaires to all four million of the country’s households asking for peoples’ views on seven statements describing my alleged plan to flood Europe, and Hungary in particular, with Muslim migrants and refugees.
The government made seven assertions about what it calls the “Soros Plan.” I rebutted each and every one based on my published statements or the lack of any published statements that could substantiate them.
Now, the government has released the supposed results of its “national consultation” on my phantom plan, claiming that the exercise was an unprecedented success.
I leave it to the Hungarian public to decide whether and to what extent the figure of 2,301,463 participants (out of a population of 9.8 million) was inflated.
It should be possible to inspect the list of those who took part and check if they did indeed participate.
Instead, I want to focus on the campaign’s substance.
The national consultation and the release of the results are the latest elements of a massive ongoing propaganda campaign funded by Hungarian taxpayers to benefit a deeply corrupt government seeking to deflect attention from its failure to fulfill Hungarians’ legitimate aspirations, particularly in education and health care.
The campaign started in the summer by flooding public spaces with posters featuring a close-up of my grinning visage with the words “Don’t let Soros have the last laugh.”
Other posters portrayed me as the puppet-master of opposition politicians.
As many have pointed out, the entire campaign carries the unmistakable odor of anti-Semitism.
The government would have you believe that I am an enemy of the Hungarian people.
Nothing could be further from the truth.
I first opened my philanthropic foundation in Hungary in 1984, when the country was still under the domination of the Soviet Union.
Since then, it has provided more than $400 million to strengthen and support the country of my birth.
In the 1990s, as ordinary Hungarians struggled with the transition from communism to a market economy, the foundation funded free milk for elementary school children in Budapest and supplied the first sonogram machines for Hungarian hospitals.
More than 3,200 Hungarians have received academic scholarships from the foundation.
Many of them have completed their graduate studies at the Central European University (CEU), which I established in Budapest in the early 1990s.
CEU now ranks among the top 100 universities in the world in the social sciences – a remarkable achievement for an academic newcomer.
Another element of the propaganda campaign has been to twist the meaning of “open society.”
So allow me to clarify what I mean when I use the term.
I do not mean open borders and mass migration aimed at destroying the supposedly Christian identity of Hungary, as the government contends.
The open society is based on the idea that nobody is in possession of the ultimate truth, and that to live together in peace we must respect minorities and minority opinions.
Above all, it is a society based on critical thinking and vigorous public debate about public policies.
That is why today my foundation – among many others including the European Union – supports groups such as the Hungarian Civil Liberties Union and the Hungarian Helsinki Committee, which protect and promote the values and principles on which the EU was founded.
The government also claims that I control the European institutions in Brussels, and that I am using that control to impose the nefarious “Soros Plan” on EU member states.
This is nonsense.
Decisions about how to address the migration crisis are made by the EU’s member states, including the Hungarian government.
It insults the intelligence of the Hungarian people to suggest otherwise.
I do have deeply held beliefs about how Europe and the rest of the developed world should respond to the refugee crisis, and I have been a vocal advocate of those views.
My beliefs are born out of personal experience.
I arrived in Britain from Hungary in 1947 as a refugee.
I have never encouraged others to become refugees.
My parents, together with 200,000 Hungarians, left the country after the defeat of the 1956 revolution, and they received asylum in the United States.
I first published my ideas on the refugee crisis in September 2015, and I have revised them over time, as the facts on the ground have changed.
In 2015, I asserted that the developed world should be able to accept at least a million refugees annually; later I reduced that global figure to 500,000, of which I suggested Europe could take 300,000.
My guiding principle is that the allocation of refugees within the EU should be entirely voluntary.
Member states should not be forced to accept refugees whom they don’t want, and refugees should not be forced to settle in countries where they are not wanted.
Member states that refuse to accept refugees can make an appropriate contribution in many other ways, but the refugee crisis is a European problem, so it needs a European solution, not 28 separate solutions.
It is this set of policy recommendations that the Hungarian government has deliberately distorted and labeled the “Soros Plan.”
Unfortunately, the EU has not adopted my ideas, and the toxic political atmosphere created by Hungary (and Poland) has reduced Europe’s capacity to receive and integrate refugees.
I do not blame the Hungarian and Polish governments for refusing to accept refugees they do not want; but I do hold them largely responsible for impeding a European solution.
I remember what happened during World War II, when another group was scapegoated for Europe’s problems.
The wounds of the past have left deep scars that have not yet healed, and which today are being reopened.
The true purpose of the government’s propaganda campaign is to stoke fear and hatred in the Hungarian people and render them indifferent to the suffering of others.
I am pleased to report that the government’s propaganda campaign has been a dismal failure.
Despite the Hungarian government’s concerted efforts, the public was not taken in.
My short speech on Hungarian television attracted more than a million viewers, and social media platforms were flooded with outpourings of sympathy and support.
I am greatly heartened by this response.
I pledge to devote the remaining years of my life to supporting free thought and expression, academic freedom, and the protection of minorities and minority opinions – not only in my native Hungary, but all over the world.
Anatomy of Illiberal Capitalism
BUDAPEST – Populists such as US President Donald Trump and de facto Polish leader Jarosław Kaczyński, and authoritarians such as Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and Russian President Vladimir Putin, do not just share Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán’s brand of so-called “illiberal democracy.” Each also espouses a form of “illiberal capitalism.”
But what does illiberal capitalism entail, and how compatible is it with illiberal democracy?
For starters, as nationalists, Trump, Kaczyński, Erdoğan, Putin, and Orbán regard the market economy not as a means of boosting dynamism, efficiency, prosperity, and individual freedom, but mainly as an instrument for strengthening state power.
Historically, there have been various schools of authoritarian right-wing thought about the relationship between the market and the state.
At one extreme, the Nazis established a command economy while maintaining private property and a high level of income inequality.
At the other extreme, early twentieth-century social Darwinists in Europe and the United States called for unfettered domestic free markets in which only the “fittest” would survive, leading to a stronger country.
Today, Russia sits at one end of the illiberal-capitalist spectrum.
Putin views the collapse of the Soviet Union as largely an economic failure, and he recognizes that private property and the market can make the Russian economy more resilient in the face of Western sanctions.
But he also believes that private-property rights come second to the needs of the Russian “security state,” which means that ownership is always conditional.
As befits a former KGB officer, Putin also believes that the Russian state has “ultimate ownership rights” to its citizens’ private assets not just in Russia, but also abroad.
Russian oligarchs and companies operating internationally – such as those that have interacted with The Trump Organization – are thus potential instruments of Russian foreign policy.
Hitler famously quipped that while the Bolsheviks had nationalized the means of production, the Nazis had gone further by nationalizing the people themselves.
This is similar to – albeit more “total” than – Putin’s own understanding of the relationship between capitalists and the state, according to which even the richest Russian oligarch is essentially a serf of the state.
Under Russia’s highly concentrated ownership structure, the Kremlin’s control of wealth is synonymous with political control.
Rather than trying to control millions of bourgeoisie, the state can deploy secret police to manage just a few dozen oligarchs.
Trump is at the other end of today’s illiberal-capitalist spectrum: no less comfortable than Putin with deep income inequalities, but not as inclined to use the state to favor particular businesspeople (other than himself).
As a result, his administration has been using executive orders to roll back many of the regulations that former US President Barack Obama introduced.
Still, there are exceptions to Trump’s support for free-market policies.
He is in favor of protectionism and cheap money, presumably because these positions play well with his core political constituency – white working-class voters.
If Trump goes down the protectionist road, however, US trade partners will retaliate, often with measures targeted directly at his base, as when the European Union recently threatened tariffs against Kentucky bourbon.
Given that threat, Trump’s economic populism will most likely manifest itself through abstinence – avoiding pro-market measures that clearly hurt the white working class.
In Turkey, Erdoğan came to power in 2003 as the champion of devoutly Muslim Anatolian entrepreneurs.
Opposing the traditional statism of Turkey’s Kemalist ruling elites, Erdoğan introduced pro-market reforms and feigned a commitment to the EU-accession process by supporting Turkish democratic institutions.
Having achieved his political aims, Erdoğan is now dispensing with his commitment to democracy.
But it remains to be seen if he will do the same with market capitalism.
Even when he first came to power, Erdoğan’s support for free markets never stopped him from denouncing imaginary economic conspiracies.
But if he tries to usher in a return to statism, Turkey’s rising entrepreneurial class may well turn on him.
In Hungary, Orbán’s approach to capitalism has been more complex.
Although he is often called a “populist” in the West, his approach combines social Darwinism and nationalism.
On the one hand, he has introduced a flat income tax that favors the wealthy and a child tax credit that benefits only higher-income households; on the other hand, like Putin, he maintains a coterie of “friendly” oligarchs who help shore up his power, not least by controlling the Hungarian media.
Kaczyński is the most economically populist of the illiberal capitalists.
He started out as a social Darwinist, once introducing a child tax credit that would later inspire Orbán.
But since his Law and Justice Party (PiS) returned to power in 2015, Kaczyński’s flagship policy has been monthly cash payments of €115 ($138) to Polish families for each child after the first.
Moreover, Kaczyński has pushed for raising the minimum pension – rather than all pensions – and for lowering the retirement age, which plays well among rural, lower-income voters, even if it renders the pension system less sustainable.
When it comes to trade, Kaczyński’s government loudly protests protectionism directed against Poland’s interests, as in the case of changes to the regime for delegated workers proposed by French President Emmanuel Macron.
Today’s examples of illiberal capitalism range from toleration of extreme inequality to favoring heavy redistribution, and from overweening statism to broad deregulation of markets.
Beyond a shared inclination toward protectionism, they do not seem to have much in common.
But far more important than each government’s economic policies is its political orientation.
It is no coincidence that all five leaders discussed here have attacked the independence of their country’s judiciary.
To be sure, Putin’s and Erdoğan’s crackdowns have been far more effective than Trump’s tweets or PiS’s stalled attempt at judicial reform this summer.
But in each case, independent judges are viewed as rival power holders.
When politics comes first, there is a temptation to bend the law toward one’s own ends.
But without the rule of law, businesses lose confidence that contracts and private-property rights will be enforced or independently arbitrated, and the economy cannot sustain strong long-term growth.
That is why illiberal democrats who place politics first will ultimately undermine the prosperity and strength of their countries, and thus their own legitimacy.
Illiberal Stagnation
NEW YORK – Today, a quarter-century after the Cold War’s end, the West and Russia are again at odds.
This time, though, at least on one side, the dispute is more transparently about geopolitical power, not ideology.
The West has supported in a variety of ways democratic movements in the post-Soviet region, hardly hiding its enthusiasm for the various “color” revolutions that have replaced long-standing dictators with more responsive leaders – though not all have turned out to be the committed democrats they pretended to be.
Too many countries of the former Soviet bloc remain under the control of authoritarian leaders, including some, like Russian President Vladimir Putin, who have learned how to maintain a more convincing façade of elections than their communist predecessors.
They sell their system of “illiberal democracy” on the basis of pragmatism, not some universal theory of history. These leaders claim that they are simply more effective at getting things done.
That is certainly true when it comes to stirring nationalist sentiment and stifling dissent. They have been less effective, however, in nurturing long-term economic growth.
Once one of the world’s two superpowers, Russia’s GDP is now about 40% of Germany’s and just over 50% of France’s.
Life expectancy at birth ranks 153rd in the world, just behind Honduras and Kazakhstan.
In terms of per capita income, Russia now ranks 73rd (in terms of purchasing power parity) – well below the Soviet Union’s former satellites in Central and Eastern Europe.
The country has deindustrialized: the vast majority of its exports now come from natural resources.
It has not evolved into a “normal” market economy, but rather into a peculiar form of crony-state capitalism.
Yes, Russia still punches above its weight in some areas, like nuclear weapons.
And it retains veto power at the United Nations.
As the recent hacking of the Democratic Party in the United States shows, it has cyber capacities that enable it to be enormously meddlesome in Western elections.
There is every reason to believe that such intrusions will continue.
Given US President Donald Trump’s deep ties with unsavory Russian characters (themselves closely linked to Putin), Americans are deeply concerned about potential Russian influences in the US – matters that may be clarified by ongoing investigations.
Many had much higher hopes for Russia, and the former Soviet Union more broadly, when the Iron Curtain fell.
After seven decades of Communism, the transition to a democratic market economy would not be easy.
But, given the obvious advantages of democratic market capitalism to the system that had just fallen apart, it was assumed that the economy would flourish and citizens would demand a greater voice.
What went wrong?
Who, if anyone, is to blame?
Could Russia’s post-communist transition have been managed better?
We can never answer such questions definitively: history cannot be re-run.
But I believe what we are confronting is partly the legacy of the flawed Washington Consensus that shaped Russia’s transition.
This framework’s influences was reflected in the tremendous emphasis reformers placed on privatization, no matter how it was done, with speed taking precedence over everything else, including creating the institutional infrastructure needed to make a market economy work.
Fifteen years ago, when I wrote Globalization and its Discontents, I argued that this “shock therapy” approach to economic reform was a dismal failure.
But defenders of that doctrine cautioned patience: one could make such judgments only with a longer-run perspective.
Today, more than a quarter-century since the onset of transition, those earlier results have been confirmed, and those who argued that private property rights, once created, would give rise to broader demands for the rule of law have been proven wrong.
Russia and many of the other transition countries are lagging further behind the advanced economies than ever.
GDP in some transition countries is below its level at the beginning of the transition.
Many in Russia believe that the US Treasury pushed Washington Consensus policies to weaken their country.
The deep corruption of the Harvard University team chosen to “help” Russia in its transition, described in a detailed account published in 2006 by Institutional Investor, reinforced these beliefs.
I believe the explanation was less sinister: flawed ideas, even with the best of intentions, can have serious consequences.
And the opportunities for self-interested greed offered by Russia were simply too great for some to resist.
Clearly, democratization in Russia required efforts aimed at ensuring shared prosperity, not policies that led to the creation of an oligarchy.
The West’s failures then should not undermine its resolve now to work to create democratic states respecting human rights and international law.
The US is struggling to prevent the Trump administration’s extremism – whether it’s a travel ban aimed at Muslims, science-denying environmental policies, or threats to ignore international trade commitments – from being normalized.
But other countries’ violations of international law, such as Russia’s actions in Ukraine, cannot be “normalized” either.
Imagining a New Bretton Woods
AUSTIN, TEXAS – The financial meltdown of 2008 prompted calls for a global financial system that curtails trade imbalances, moderates speculative capital flows, and prevents systemic contagion.
That, of course, was the goal of the original Bretton Woods system.
But such a system today would be both untenable and undesirable.
So, what might an alternative look like?
The 1944 Bretton Woods conference featured a clash of two men and their visions: Harry Dexter White, President Franklin Roosevelt’s representative, and John Maynard Keynes, representing a fading British Empire.
Unsurprisingly, White’s scheme, founded on the United States’ post-war trade surplus, which it deployed to dollarize Europe and Japan in exchange for their acquiescence to full monetary-policy discretion for the US, prevailed.
And the new post-war system provided the foundation for capitalism’s finest hour – until America lost its surplus and White’s arrangement collapsed.
The question asked periodically during much of the last decade is straightforward: Would Keynes’s discarded plan be more appropriate for our post-2008 multipolar world?
Zhou Xiaochuan, the governor of China’s central bank, suggested so in early 2009, lamenting that Bretton Woods had not embraced Keynes’s proposal.
Two years later, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, then-Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund, was asked what he thought the IMF’s post-2008 role ought to be.
He replied: “Keynes, 60 years ago, already foresaw what was needed; but it was too early.
Now is the time to do it.
And I think we are ready to do it!”
Within weeks, however, Strauss-Kahn fell from grace, without ever explaining what he meant.
But it is not too hard to sketch out what “it” might be.
Above all, the new system would reflect Keynes’s view that global stability is undermined by capitalism’s innate tendency to drive a wedge between surplus and deficit economies.
The surpluses and deficits grow larger during the upturn, and the burden of adjustment falls disproportionately on debtors during the downturn, leading to a debt-deflationary process that takes root in the deficit regions before dampening demand everywhere.
To counter this tendency, Keynes advocated replacing any system in which “the process of adjustment is compulsory for the debtor and voluntary for the creditor” with one in which the force of adjustment falls symmetrically upon debtors and creditors.
Keynes’ solution was an international clearing union (ICU) to which all major economies would subscribe.
While keeping their own currencies and central banks, members would agree to denominate all payments in a common accounting unit, which Keynes named the “bancor,” and to settle all international payments through the ICU.
Initially, each member state’s reserve account with the ICU would be credited with a sum of bancors proportionate to its relative share of world trade.
Thereafter, each would be credited with extra bancors in proportion to its net exports.
Once established, the ICU would tax persistent surpluses and deficits symmetrically, to annul the negative feedback mechanism between unbalanced capital flows, volatility, inadequate global aggregate demand, and unnecessary unemployment distributed unevenly around the world.
Keynes’s proposal was not without problems.
It envisaged fixed currencies, which would require limited overdraft facilities for countries in chronic deficit and would entail constant haggling between finance ministers about re-setting exchange and interest rates.
And rigid financial controls, which lend bureaucrats inordinate discretionary power over capital transfers, amount to a fatal flaw.
But there is no reason why an ICU cannot be designed with variable exchange rates and simple, automated rules which minimize politicians’ and bureaucrats’ discretionary power, while preserving the benefits of Keynes’s original idea for keeping global imbalances in check.
A new ICU, or NICU, would be as Keynes had envisaged it.
But, in place of the abstract bancor, it would feature a common digital currency – say, Kosmos – to be issued and regulated by the IMF.
The Fund would administer Kosmos on the basis of a transparent digital distributed ledger and an algorithm that would adjust total supply in a pre-agreed manner to the volume of world trade, allowing for an automatic countercyclical component that boosts global supply at times of a general slowdown.
Foreign-exchange markets would function as they do now, and the exchange rate between Kosmos and various currencies would vary in the same way that the IMF’s Special Drawing Rights do vis-à-vis the dollar, euro, yen, pound, and renminbi.
The difference, of course, would be that, under NICU, member states would allow all payments to one another to pass through their central bank’s NICU Kosmos account.
To exploit the scheme’s full potential for keeping imbalances in check, two stabilizing transfers would be introduced.
First, a trade-imbalance levy would be charged annually to each central bank’s Kosmos account in proportion to its current-account deficit or surplus and paid into a common NICU fund.
Second, private financial institutions would pay a fee into the same NICU fund in proportion to any surge of capital flows out of a country, reminiscent of the price hike that companies like Uber impose during peak traffic.
The trade-imbalance levy is intended to motivate surplus countries’ governments to boost domestic spending and investment while systematically reducing deficit countries’ international spending power.
Foreign-exchange markets will factor this in, adjusting exchange rates faster in response to current-account imbalances and canceling out much of the capital flows which today support chronically unbalanced trade.
Likewise, the “surge” charge will automatically penalize speculative, herd-like capital inflows or outflows, without increasing bureaucrats’ discretionary power or introducing inflexible capital controls.
Suddenly, the world will have acquired, without the need for subscribed capital, a global sovereign wealth fund.
This would enable the transition to a low-carbon energy system to be financed on a global scale and in a manner that stabilizes the global economy through investments in research and development dedicated to green energy and sustainable technologies.
Keynes was ahead of his time: His proposal necessitated digital technologies and foreign-currency markets that did not exist in the 1940s.
But we have them today, along with institutional experience with international clearing systems.
We also have a desperate need for the global green transition fund that a Keynesian Bretton Woods would automatically create.
All that we lack is the political process, indeed a Roosevelt, to convene the players and catalyze change.
Inconvenient Truths About Migration
LONDON – Sociology, anthropology, and history have been making large inroads into the debate on immigration.
It seems that Homo economicus, who lives for bread alone, has given way to someone for whom a sense of belonging is at least as important as eating.
This makes one doubt that hostility to mass immigration is simply a protest against job losses, depressed wages, and growing inequality.
Economics has certainly played a part in the upsurge of identity politics, but the crisis of identity will not be expunged by economic reforms alone.
Economic welfare is not the same as social wellbeing.
Let’s start, though, with the economics, using the United Kingdom – now heading out of the EU – as a case in point.
Between 1991 and 2013 there was a net inflow of 4.9 million foreign-born migrants into Britain.
Standard economic theory tells us that net inward migration, like free trade, benefits the native population only after a lag.
The argument here is that if you increase the quantity of labor, its price (wages) falls.
This will increase profits.
The increase in profits leads to more investment, which will increase demand for labor, thereby reversing the initial fall in wages.
Immigration thus enables a larger population to enjoy the same standard of living as the smaller population did before – a clear improvement in total welfare.
A recent study by Cambridge University economist Robert Rowthorn, however, has shown that this argument is full of holes.
The so-called temporary effects in terms of displaced native workers and lower wages may last five or ten years, while the beneficial effects assume an absence of recession.
And, even with no recession, if there is a continuing inflow of migrants, rather than a one-off increase in the size of the labor force, demand for labor may constantly lag behind growth in supply.
The “claim that immigrants take jobs from local workers and push down their wages,” Rowthorn argues, “may be exaggerated, but it is not always false.”
A second economic argument is that immigration will rejuvenate the labor force and stabilize public finances, because young, imported workers will generate the taxes required to support a rising number of pensioners.
The UK population is projected to surpass 70 million before the end of the next decade, an increase of 3.6 million, or 5.5%, owing to net immigration and a surplus of births over deaths among the newcomers.
Rowthorn dismisses this argument.
“Rejuvenation through immigration is an endless treadmill,” he says. “To maintain a once-and-for-all reduction in the dependency ratio requires a never-ending stream of immigrants.
Once the inflow stops, the age structure will revert to its original trajectory.”
A lower inflow and a higher retirement age would be a much better solution to population aging.
Thus, even with optimal outcomes, like the avoidance of recession, the economic arguments for large-scale immigration are hardly conclusive.
So the crux of the matter is really its social impact.
Here, the familiar benefit of diversity confronts the downside risk of a loss of social cohesion.
David Goodhart, former editor of the journal Prospect, has argued the case for restriction from a social democratic perspective.
Goodhart takes no position on whether cultural diversity is intrinsically or morally good or bad.
He simply takes it for granted that most people prefer to live with their own kind, and that policymakers must attend to this preference.
A laissez-faire attitude to the composition of a country’s population is as untenable as indifference to its size.
For Goodhart, the taproot of liberals’ hostility to migration controls is their individualist view of society.
Failing to comprehend people’s attachment to settled communities, they label hostility to immigration irrational or racist.
Liberal over-optimism about the ease of integrating migrants stems from the same source: if society is no more than a collection of individuals, integration is a non-issue.
Of course, says Goodhart, immigrants do not have to abandon their traditions completely, but “there is such a thing as society,” and if they make no effort to join it, native citizens will find it hard to consider them part of the “imagined community.”
A too-rapid inflow of immigrants weakens bonds of solidarity, and, in the long run, erodes the affective ties required to sustain the welfare state.
“People will always favor their own families and communities,” Goodhart argues, and “it is the task of a realistic liberalism to strive for a definition of community that is wide enough to include people from many different backgrounds, without being so wide as to become meaningless.”
Economic and political liberals are bedfellows in championing unrestricted immigration.
Economic liberals view national frontiers as irrational obstacles to the global integration of markets.
Many political liberals regard nation-states and the loyalties they inspire as obstacles to the wider political integration of humanity.
Both appeal to moral obligations that stretch far beyond nations’ cultural and physical boundaries.
At issue is the oldest debate in the social sciences.
Can communities be created by politics and markets, or do they presuppose a prior sense of belonging?
It seems to me that anyone who thinks about such matters is bound to agree with Goodhart that citizenship, for most people, is something they are born into.
Values are grown from a specific history and geography.
If the make-up of a community is changed too fast, it cuts people adrift from their own history, rendering them rootless.
Liberals’ anxiety not to appear racist hides these truths from them.
An explosion of what is now called populism is the inevitable result.
The policy conclusion to be drawn is banal, but worth restating.
A people’s tolerance for change and adaptation should not be strained beyond its limits, different though these will be in different countries.
Specifically, immigration should not be pressed too far, because it will be sure to ignite hostility.
Politicians who fail to “control the borders” do not deserve their people’s trust.
New Light on Income Inequality
ABU DHABI – Speeches by politicians on inequality tend to be short on facts and long on ideological assertion.
In developing and emerging economies, one charitable explanation for the poor quality of public discourse about income inequality is that data on income distribution are often unavailable or dubious.
On this most important of subjects, debates tend to generate more heat than light.
A new set of studies could help put an end to all that.
Led by Nora Lustig, a professor of economics who specializes in Latin America, a team at Tulane University’s Commitment to Equity Institute created comprehensive databases on both the state of income distribution and the effects of government policies on that distribution.
Crucially, the figures are comparable across a large set of middle- and low-income countries and also with data available for advanced countries.
Preliminary conclusions emerging from these studies will illuminate political debates – and likely annoy ideologues of both the right and the left.
Start, Lustig argues in a recent paper, with the fact that world income inequality is not rising.
Consider the Gini coefficient, the most common measure of inequality, which runs from a value of zero for perfect equality to 100 for perfect inequality (one person receives all the income).
The average Gini score (not weighted by population) in countries for which there are data declined slightly in the 2000-2010 period, from 39 to 38.
Yes, the score rose in rich countries over the same period – from 29.8 to 30.4.
But it fell precipitously in Latin America, from a scandalous 55.1 in 2000 – which made the continent the world’s most unequal region – to a still-very-high 50.2 a decade later.
The Gini score also dropped in South Asia.
In Sub-Saharan Africa, where data are more fragile, it seems to have remained roughly constant.
Moreover, inequality seems to be dropping precisely where it was most acute to begin with.
This is true both for regions, particularly Latin America, and for countries, such as Brazil and South Africa.
So the often-heard assertion that rising inequality is the central economic fact of our times is probably due to a disparity of a different kind: the outsize impact of rich-country pundits and news outlets on international debates.
Another set of findings is sure to upset zealots from the right: tax-and-transfer schemes can have, and are having, a significant impact in reducing inequality.
In one comparison of middle-income countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, Lustig shows that Gini coefficients after taxes and transfers (including the cash value of education and health services) are significantly lower than those for initial market incomes.
The average drop for the nine emerging countries – including the still hugely unequal South Africa – that she compares is more than three points (55.7 to 52.5).
The same exercise, which treats pensions as deferred consumption and therefore abstracts from the redistributive role of pensions among the older populations of the advanced economies, yields a drop of seven points in the United States and a bit more than nine points in the European Union.
So emerging countries are doing better – but could improve considerably.
But this does not mean that activists should demand higher taxes and public spending under all circumstances.
The quality of government programs makes a big difference.
Brazil has a public sector that is roughly twice the size of Chile’s – total tax revenue is approximately 20% of GDP in the latter and somewhere around 40% (estimates differ) in the former.
And social expenditure (again treating pensions as deferred consumption) is also twice as large in Brazil: 16% versus 8% of GDP.
But, according to Lustig, the effect of government redistribution on inequality is the same in both countries: a nearly four-point drop in the Gini score.
What Lustig does not explore is that the contrast is even sharper if one recalls that Brazil’s government spends a great deal less than Chile’s on infrastructure, relative to GDP.
It is hard to escape the conclusion that some public expenditure in Brazil serves little purpose other than keeping certain political constituencies conveniently quiet.
A case also worth noting is that of Bolivia, where left-wing administrations have significantly expanded social-welfare spending.
But, because cash transfers are universal, rather than targeted at the poor, the overall effect is not progressive but neutral, another paper finds.
Crucially, taxes and transfers are not the only way to fight inequality.
Earlier work by Lustig and her coauthors found that a declining wage premium – that is, a drop in the wage gap between workers with high and low education – explained part of the decline in the Gini coefficient in Latin American countries.
It is not easy to disentangle the role of supply and demand factors in the reduction of the wage premium, but both seem to have played a role.
On the demand side, exchange-rate devaluations made non-traditional exports more competitive and helped boost demand for relatively unskilled labor.
On the supply side, a sharp increase in years of schooling, and especially in access to higher education, swelled the ranks of professionals and other skilled workers and helped lower their relative wages.
This is all good for income distribution, but the resulting politics remains fraught.
Student activists demanding (along with the rest of society) a fairer distribution of resources may not wish to hear that the growing numbers of professionals often resulted from the rapid and controversial expansion of private – and sometimes for-profit, universities – and that this accounts for part of the drop in inequality.
Similarly, young men and women who worked hard to get to university with the expectation of very high relative compensation are not happy to find that the wages of, say, journalists and psychologists, are rising much more slowly than those of computer technicians or machine operators.
Indeed, this frustration is behind (though not always overtly) many of the recent university student protests in Latin America and elsewhere.
So income inequality is bound to prove politically controversial when it is worsening, and also when it tends to decline.
Studies like those led by Lustig can illuminate the inevitable controversies, so that they yield better policies rather than simple acrimony.
The Siege of the Taj Mahal
NEW DELHI – In a country where politics has turned toxic, leading virtually everything – from festival firecrackers to animal husbandry – to take on a “communal” religious coloring, perhaps it should not be surprising that even one of the world’s most famous monuments has become a target. But that doesn’t make it any less tragic – or destructive.
The Taj Mahal is India’s most magnificent architectural wonder.
Built nearly four centuries ago by the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan as a mausoleum for his beloved wife, the marble monument was hailed by Rabindranath Tagore, India’s only Nobel Prize-winning writer, as “a teardrop on the cheek of Time.”
But the tears this time are for the Taj itself.
Its gleaming white surface is yellowing, owing to air pollution from nearby factories and cottage industries.
Repairs are needed so frequently that scaffolding often obscures its famous minarets. The town of Agra in the state of Uttar Pradesh, where the Taj is located, is crowded and grimy.
Unsurprisingly, tourism is down: the number of foreign visitors to the Taj Mahal fell by 35% from 2012 to 2015, and domestic tourism has also declined.
Those who do still show up are bowled over by the Taj, but often appalled at what they see around it.
This past summer, the American basketball player Kevin Durant sparked a row with his graphic descriptions of the monument’s surroundings.
But now the Taj is being rejected even by India’s own government.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which now rules Uttar Pradesh, has apparently decided that it wants as little to do with it as possible.
The reason comes down to religious chauvinism.
Uttar Pradesh’s new chief minister, a saffron-robed Hindu monk named Yogi Adityanath, initiated the assault on the Taj by condemning the state government’s former practice of offering models of the Taj as gifts to visiting foreign dignitaries.
Declaring that the monument does not “reflect Indian culture,” Adityanath announced that the government would hand out copies of the Hindu holy book, the Bhagavad Gita, instead.
Furthering this erasure, the Uttar Pradesh tourism department issued a brochure of the state’s main attractions, but left out the Taj Mahal, the state’s (and the country’s) main tourism destination.
The government, preferring to promote Hindu religious tourism, such as the attractions of the holy city of Varanasi, has denied any cultural heritage funding to the Taj Mahal in the current fiscal year.
To outsiders, the BJP’s campaign against the Taj Mahal might seem bizarre.
Why would anyone, let alone a country’s ruling party, want to undermine a universally admired – and revenue-generating – architectural marvel?
And yet anyone familiar with the BJP knows that its attacks on the Taj are just one manifestation of the party’s politics of hatred toward anything connected to the history of Muslim rule in India.
To BJP true believers, the Muslims who ruled India for centuries were foreign invaders who despoiled a prosperous land, destroyed temples and palaces, enslaved and discriminated against Hindus, assaulted Hindu women, and converted millions to Islam.
In this telling, this sordid saga of assault on Hindus culminated in the 1947 Partition of India by the British, which created Pakistan.
This is a highly simplistic interpretation of a complex history – one characterized far more by assimilation and co-existence than by religious conflict.
But that doesn’t matter to the Hindu chauvinists who constitute the bulk of the BJP’s electoral base.
They agree with the hardline Hindu chauvinist and BJP legislator Sangeet Som, who last month called the Taj Mahal “a blot on Indian culture” that had been “built by traitors” and “should have no place in Indian history.”
If people like Shah Jahan – who supposedly wanted to “wipe out all Hindus from India” – were part of India’s history, Som said, “we will change this history.”
India’s Hindu extremists have long considered it humiliating that a monument built by a Muslim emperor could be Hindu-majority India’s most recognizable site.
The difference now is that this is no longer a fringe group; its members are now in power in Uttar Pradesh, with enablers leading the government in Delhi.
Adityanath, for example, first gained attention for his incendiary anti-Muslim speeches – he spent 11 days in jail in 2007 for fomenting religious tension – and for leading a squad of volunteers who specialized in attacking Muslim targets.
He earned notoriety by calling India’s most beloved film star – a Muslim – a terrorist.
More recently, he urged the national government to impose a travel ban on Muslims, as US President Donald Trump has attempted to do.
Adityanath’s attacks on the Taj, however, have sparked national outrage powerful enough to force him to visit Agra to assure an anxious public that his government is committed to protecting the monument.
“What is important,” he grudgingly conceded, “is that it was built by the blood and sweat of India’s farmers and laborers.”
This acknowledgement is only partly reassuring, as it enables another fringe position on the Taj: the late chauvinist historian P.N. Oak’s claim that the monument was originally a Shiva temple named “Tejo Mahalaya.”
Some misguided Hindutva elements have already been caught trying to perform a Shiva puja (a rite to worship Lord Shiva) there.
The RSS, the parent body of the Hindu “family” of organizations that includes the BJP, has even called for Muslims to be prohibited from praying at the Taj.
For seven decades after independence, Indian identity rested on cultural pluralism.
Now, the Hindu-chauvinist BJP is seeking to redefine India as a Hindu nation long subjugated by foreigners – not just British colonizers, but also Muslim conquerors.
By stoking long-buried resentments and promoting hatred of Muslims, the BJP’s kulturkampf is dividing Indian society, fragmenting its political discourse, and undermining its soft power in the world.
If the BJP is to avoid doing further damage to the Indian nation, it must recognize that the past is not a blunt tool for scoring petty political points.
One cannot avenge oneself upon history: history is its own revenge.
How India’s Caste System Survives
NEW DELHI – On January 17, Rohith Vemula, a PhD candidate at the University of Hyderabad in India’s Telangana state, hanged himself.
Even in a country of 1.2 billion people, a single death can have a major impact.
Vemula was a Dalit – a member of what was once known as the “untouchables,” at the bottom of the Hindu caste system.
He was also a leader of the Ambedkar Students Association at Hyderabad University, seeking to promote Dalit rights.
In death, Vemula has achieved something he could not have imagined: He has become a national hero, his tragedy emblematic of the toxic durability of caste in India’s development narrative.
Unlike race, caste is invisible: a person’s face does not indicate it.
Yet it retains a powerful hold on Indian society, limiting the opportunities available at all stages of life.
To be a Dalit is to wear an invisible stigma that dogs one’s daily interactions.
Vemula’s death has reminded Indians once again that the more than 300 million who belong to the lowest castes, as well as the “tribals” or indigenous people, still face discrimination, prejudice, hostility, and even violence on each step of the social ladder.
To be sure, India’s government has made significant efforts to redress the situation.
Nine days after Vemula’s death, India celebrated the 66th anniversary of the adoption of its constitution, which sought to combat the country’s rigid social stratification with the world’s first and most comprehensive affirmative-action program.
Designated castes and tribes were guaranteed not only equality of opportunity, but also positive outcomes, aided by quotas for educational institutions, government jobs, and even seats in parliament and state assemblies.
These quotas, or “reservations,” were granted based on people’s (presumably immutable) caste identities.
It was a small step toward compensating the millions of unfortunates who had suffered daily the injustices and humiliations of “untouchability.”
Over the last 66 years, politicians have maintained a strong commitment to affirmative action.
Though originally intended to expire after ten years, the reservations have been extended for 70, with further extensions certain when they come up for renewal in 2020.
The quotas remain the “third rail” of Indian politics; one touches it at one’s peril.
Yet Dalits feel only marginally better off than their wretched forebears.
And, indeed, they remain behind the advanced castes in terms of all socioeconomic indicators, from education levels to family income.
Vemula was admitted to his university on merit, not through the reservation system.
Yet he faced all the prejudice that would be directed at any Dalit.
He left behind a passionate letter outlining his mistreatment at the hands of an insensitive and bureaucratic university administration.
The ultimate indignity was the withholding of a fellowship on which he depended to support not only himself, but also his single mother – a punishment for his political activism.
In fact, intensifying his letter’s pathos, he requested that part of the money the university owes him be paid to his family to cover debts he incurred as a result of being denied his fellowship.
Clearly, reservations of public-sector jobs and college seats alone have failed to end the discrimination.
Vemula’s death sparked a wave of public protests, with leading politicians flocking to Hyderabad to add their voices to the growing clamor against not just the university, but also the government – especially Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who remained silent for nearly a week after the tragedy.
Finally, Modi spoke emotionally at the Dalit-majority Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar University in Lucknow (named for an iconic Dalit leader who had chaired the Constitution Drafting Committee), pleading that the issue not be politicized: “Politics has its place, but a mother lost her son.”
Yet politics is integral to the problems highlighted by the tragedy.
India’s first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, had hoped that caste consciousness would wither away after independence.
But the opposite has happened.
Because caste was such a powerful source of self-identification, it proved to be a useful tool for political mobilization in India’s electoral democracy: When Indians cast their vote, they too often vote their caste.
Granting sops to various castes proved a major vote-getting tactic for India’s politicians.
If India is to eliminate the discrimination and indignities faced by members of its lower castes, it must transcend the politics of identity and focus on broader development goals and socioeconomic challenges.
This will be no easy feat – especially as Indians compete for scarce opportunities in an overpopulated land.
So long as prejudice persists, politicians in India’s contentious democracy will exploit it.
January 30 marked the 68th anniversary of the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi, who fought not merely for independence, but also for a more just, equal, and moral India.
The country must see in the Vemula tragedy a reminder of the vital need to rededicate ourselves to Gandhi’s ideals, so that bright Dalit students are not driven to despair – or worse.
It may be a pious hope, but it is the very foundation of Indian nationhood.
India’s Culture War Comes to Bollywood
NEW DELHI – Culture and history have become new battlegrounds in India.
Debates over the Taj Mahal’s position as a symbol of multicultural India have yet to be settled, yet the nation is already being torn apart further by another cultural controversy – this time, over a film.
The film, “Padmavati,” tells the story of an eponymous Rajput queen believed to have died, together with 16,000 other women of the Rajput warrior caste, by self-immolation in 1301, in order to avoid being captured alive by the invading Delhi Sultan Alauddin Khilji.
Despite not even having been released, “Padmavati” has already inspired countless front-page stories and debates on the evening news, hysterical threats of violence, and a ban in four states governed by India’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party.
The historical accuracy of Padmavati’s story is dubious: no contemporary account of Khilji’s attack on Chittorgarh, including by historians accompanying his forces, mentions the queen.
Yet Padmavati has been a figure of legend since 1540, when the Sufi mystic poet Malik Muhammad Jayasi devoted his lyrical epic “Padmavat”to her story.
It has been suggested that Jayasi did not intend his tale to be taken literally, and that his work, instead, represented the Persian mystical-poetic tradition of using romance to represent humanity’s search for the divine.
By this interpretation, the poem is an allegory for the union of mind and soul, under attack from external forces.
Jayasi chose Khilji’s attack on Chittorgarh as a setting for his epic, because its name includes the word chit (consciousness).
But literature, once published, acquires a life of its own.
Jayasi’s tale was retold countless times, by Bengali bards, Rajasthani folk-tellers, and even the English Colonel Tod, who included Padmavati’s tale in his compilation Annals and Antiquities of Rajputana.
Through those retellings, her self-immolation (jauhar) became a noble act of resistance against the lustful Muslim, making her an exemplar of unsullied Hindu womanhood.
Over time, Padmavati was effectively deified.
The reputed site of her suicide became a tourist attraction.
The head of a Rajput organization, the Karni Sena, claimed to be her direct descendent.
(When confronted with the view that she was fictional, he replied, “I am 37th in her direct line of descent.
Am I a ghost?”)
With so much riding on Padmavati’s image as a symbol of female honor and purity, Sanjay Leela Bhansali, the Bollywood filmmaker who set out to make a film of her story, unwittingly became a target of historical passions.
The Karni Sena trashed the film set at Jaigarh Fort in Jaipur, and disrupted further shooting in a new (less “authentic”) location at Kohlapur, accusing Bhansali of filming a love scene between the Hindu queen and the Muslim invader.
The Rajput community is also rumored to have delayed the release of the film on the grounds that it “distorted history,” though Bhansali has denied this.
The film’s detractors, including the four BJP chief ministers who instituted the preemptive bans, did not even see the film before condemning it.
That is how defensive some Hindus in India have become over the version of history to which they subscribe – even when, as in Padmavati’s case, that history may well be nothing more than a figment of collective imagination.
No less an ardent secularist than India’s first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, summed up the phenomenon seven decades ago: “Facts and fiction are so interwoven together as to be inseparable, and this amalgam becomes an imagined history, which may not tell us exactly what happened but does tell us something equally important — what people believed had taken place, what they thought their heroic ancestors were capable of, and what ideals inspired them.”
This “imagined history” – “a mixture of fact and fiction, or sometimes only fiction” – becomes “symbolically true.”
This explains, in a nutshell, the opposition to “Padmavati.”
For some Hindus, the difference between historical fact and cultural myth does not matter; what is remembered and believed is as important as what is verifiable.
And in today’s climate, where “taking offense” is the name of the game and “hurting the sentiments of a community” is the name of the crime, that perspective is particularly relevant.
The old Hindu boasts of expansive tolerance and acceptance of difference – the very tenets that underlie India’s remarkable diversity – are wearing thin these days.
But there is precedent for this response.
Indeed, Bhansali should have taken heed of the backlash against another film a decade ago.
That time, hairdressers objected to the film “Billu Barber,” arguing (absurdly) that the term “barber” is an insult to their profession.
So they threatened to protest the film everywhere it was shown – threats that forced the Bollywood star and producer to drop the second word, renaming the film simply “Billu.”
It may not seem to matter much what some lumpen elements think of a Bollywood film.
But such responses reflect the same narrow-mindedness that led to the notorious “pulping” of Sanksrit scholar Wendy Doniger’s erudite books on Hinduism.
While it may seem alarmist to suggest that freedom of expression in India is in peril, the atmosphere of intimidation by inflamed mobs, to whom governments surrender all too willingly, is palpable.
By permitting these intolerant bullies to get away with their lawless acts of intimidation, we are allowing them to do violence to something vital to India’s survival as a civilization.
A pluralist and democratic India must, by definition, tolerate diverse expressions of its many identities.
To allow self-appointed arbiters of Indian culture to impose their hypocrisy and double standards on the rest of us is to permit them to define Indianness down until it ceases to be Indian.
India’s Lost Fisherfolk
NEW DELHI – Last month, a devastating cyclone swept the southern tip of India, causing immense damage to parts of Kerala, Tamil Nadu, and Lakshadweep.
Most victims of the oddly named Cyclone Ockhi were fishermen from the districts of Thiruvananthapuram (in Kerala) and Kanyakumari (in Tamil Nadu) who, owing to the lack of a timely cyclone alert, had ventured out to sea, unaware of the danger.
Their tragedy highlights the extreme vulnerability of India’s poor coastal communities to the vagaries of nature.
So far, Ockhi is known to have taken 245 lives, with 661 still missing, many of whom were lost at sea and are unlikely ever to be found.
Moreover, nearly 3,500 homes were damaged in Kerala alone, with 221 completely destroyed.
The storm was so powerful that its winds even shook parts of Maharashtra and Gujarat.
For me, Ockhi was no distant headline.
As the Member of Parliament representing Thiruvananthapuram, I witnessed firsthand the disaster and its terrible toll on some of India’s poorest and most marginalized people.
I have visited the homes of the bereaved, and lit incense sticks and candles at makeshift shrines.
As I mourned with these beleaguered communities, trying to share their pain and grief, I vowed to do all I can to secure help for them.
So far, the national and state governments have focused largely – and quite appropriately – on providing immediate relief to the affected families.
But, to protect India’s coastal communities, policymakers must urgently undertake a comprehensive review of the reasons why the cyclone was so devastating, and how the impact of a future disaster could be mitigated.
No cyclone alert was issued by the India Meteorological Department until Ockhi had already struck, and the initial rescue efforts were grossly inadequate to the scale of the challenge.
By the time the Coast Guard and the Indian Navy had brought enough ships and planes to the affected area, a full 24 hours had passed since Ockhi capsized numerous fishing boats.
It was too late to rescue those who had been clinging to the wreckage.
Official search and rescue efforts saved only a handful of lives.
Meanwhile, fisherfolk – that is, the friends and relatives of those who had ventured out to the wrong place at the wrong time – clamored to join those efforts.
After all, they knew where their colleagues and loved ones were likely to be.
When they were finally allowed on board the rescue vessels, they guided officials to areas where floating bodies had been spotted.
But many of those bodies were not picked up, because the naval ships had no facilities to accommodate corpses, and the defense ministry was still “in the process of procuring” mobile mortuaries.
The fisherfolk are not alone in criticizing the ineffectiveness of the rescue efforts.
India needs a detailed official inquiry into the various elements of disaster prediction, management, and relief, guided by the experience of Ockhi.
Would better institutional arrangements, such as closer cooperation with international typhoon monitoring bodies, have ensured a timely forecast?
How can relief operations and overall emergency management be improved?
Should search-and-rescue aircraft and vessels be stationed in the vicinity?
One way to strengthen India’s disaster-response capabilities would be to create the marine equivalent of our Territorial Army, training selected fisherfolk in how to carry out search-and-rescue operations.
Such training, together with students’ affinity for their fellow fishermen and their expertise in braving turbulent seas, would make for a highly effective reserve unit, to be deployed when disaster strikes.
Another issue that risks being overlooked by the focus on urgent and immediate financial relief is coastal communities’ long-term economic needs.
To be sure, immediate relief is vital: Ockhi has completely shut down everyday activities in some coastal areas, causing severe economic (not to mention emotional) distress for the region’s poor fishing communities.
But perhaps it is time to consider whether it is fair to condemn these communities to long-term dependence on fishing.
Just as India’s agriculture cannot sustain all the farmers trying to live off the land, our over-fished seas cannot possibly sustain all of our fishermen.
With their traditional fishing grounds unable to deliver a decent living, they risk their lives to venture farther and farther from shore.
Some of my constituents have been arrested as far afield as the British Indian Ocean territory of Diego Garcia, which they reached in their hunt for unexploited fishing grounds.
As it stands, members of India’s fishing communities do not have any alternative skills that would enable them to pursue other occupations.
Offering them and their children skills development and vocational training courses in other fields would transform their lives for the better.
Ockhi has starkly demonstrated that all is not well for India’s fisherfolk.
To prevent the next natural disaster from causing so much damage and inflicting so much pain, we must take action now to improve prediction and response, and strengthen the resilience of our most vulnerable citizens.
Why India Should Scrap Parliamentary Democracy
NEW DELHI – India’s parliamentary system, inherited from the British, is rife with ineffiencies.
By the logic of Westminster, you elect a legislature to form the executive, and when the executive does not command a secure majority in the legislative assembly, the government falls, triggering fresh elections.
The result is a vote in some or other of India’s 29 state assemblies every six months or so, each one acting as a sort of referendum on the government in New Delhi.
In short, India’s freewheeling multi-party democracy has become one of perennial plebiscite.
India’s latest round of elections included five state assemblies.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) prevailed in Uttar Pradesh – India’s largest state, which is home to more than 200 million people and has produced seven of 15 prime ministers – and in neighboring Uttarakhand.
The main opposition party, the Indian National Congress, triumphed in the northwestern state of Punjab and won pluralities in Goa and Manipur (though the BJP formed governments in the latter two states anyway, by assembling coalitions to ensure legislative majorities).
It looks like a mixed result.
But India’s national politics has long been skewed toward the Hindi-speaking northern heartland, and Uttar Pradesh has far more voters than the other four states combined.
So the results have been hailed as a victory for the BJP, affirming Modi’s popularity and vindicating his leadership – including of the campaign itself.
Indeed, Modi personally commanded the campaign in Uttar Pradesh, whose fabled city of Varanasi he represents in parliament.
With his attendance at multiple political events and addresses to innumerable campaign rallies, Modi staked his government’s image – and, some would say, his own reputation as prime minister – on the election.
The benefits extend beyond status.
Victory in Uttar Pradesh was critical to enable Modi to take control of India’s Upper House, whose members are elected by state legislative assemblies.
The latest election results also assure him the legislative numbers he needs to get his own candidates elected as India’s President in July and Vice-President in August.
But at what cost?
One clear downside of India’s perennial electioneering is that prime ministers must frequently leave aside their role as leader of the country to act as leader of their party.
Modi is a take-no-prisoners campaigner, who revels in punchy invective and freely launches partisan attacks at opponents (including me).
There’s nothing statesmanlike about it, and yet it will happen again soon, with a fresh round of elections, including in Modi’s home state of Gujarat, due before the end of the year.
If there ever were need for yet another clinching argument for a presidential system in India, it is the spectacle of the head of government abandoning the responsibilities of that office every few months to go on the stump for their party.
The parliamentary system has not merely outlived any good it could do India; it was never well suited to Indian conditions.
In fact, it is responsible for many of our principal political ills.
Like the American revolutionaries two centuries ago, Indian nationalists fought for “the rights of Englishmen,” which they thought the replication of the Houses of Parliament would epitomize and guarantee.
When former British Prime Minister Clement Attlee, as a member of a British constitutional commission, suggested the United States’ presidential system as a model for India, the country’s leaders “rejected it with great emphasis.”
Attlee recalled, “I had the feeling that they thought I was offering them margarine instead of butter.”
But perhaps margarine might have suited India’s vegetarian tastes better.
Indeed, while a parliamentary system can work in a small, largely homogenous country, in India’s large, diverse, and fractious polity, it has been messy, to say the least.
The system’s apologists point out that it has kept India together and given every citizen a stake in the country’s political destiny.
But any form of genuine democracy would do that.
The question is which form of democracy would also ensure effective performance, without allowing the government to be constantly distracted by petty politics.
Perhaps the answer lies in the US or Latin American model, with a directly elected chief executive – a president, at the national level, and a governor, at the state level – serving a fixed term as both head of state and head of government.
A directly elected chief executive would not be vulnerable to the shifting sands of legislative support.
They could appoint a cabinet of talented officials, confident in the stability of their tenure.
Above all, they could devote their energies to governance, rather than just to politics.
The relentless election cycle would come to an end.
In such a system, citizens would actually be voting for the individual they want in charge.
The president could therefore claim to speak for a majority of Indians, rather than a majority of members of parliament.
At the end of a fixed period of time – say, five years, as India’s MPs are currently accorded – the public would be able to judge their leader’s success at improving citizens’ lives, rather than at keeping a government in office.
Of course, in a sense, democracy is an end in itself.
It is vital for India’s survival.
Pluralism is a fundamental element of who we are, and we are proud of it.
But few Indians are proud of the kind of politics our democracy has inflicted upon us.
In order to confront the challenges and meet the needs of one-sixth of the world’s population, India’s leaders must operate within a democracy that enables, rather than hampers, governance.
Only then can they deliver progress to the people they represent.
A presidential system would do just that.
It would enable leaders to focus on representing the people, instead of on staying in power.
With a more expansive and predictable election cycle, India’s leaders would be able to move beyond the unpleasant business of political contention, and settle down to governance.
In that shift in focus lies a presidential system’s ultimate vindication.
The Last Bastion of a Profitable Press
NEW DELHI – Around the world, newspapers seem to be facing imminent extinction, as a mass exodus to the Internet causes their circulation to slump and their advertising revenue to collapse.
But not in India.
In the West, young people have largely dispensed with the home-delivered physical morning newspaper, and instead catch up on the news whenever they choose, using tablets, laptops, or mobile phones.
As advertising revenue has been vacuumed up by the Internet giants Facebook and Google, newspaper profits have plunged.
The industry has faced many bankruptcies in recent years, with those still operating often having laid off large numbers of staff, especially in their foreign bureaus.
In the United States, the number of full-time journalists has dropped by 20% since 2001.
Even several grand titles have either closed down or publish only online.
Cyberspace is, after all, where the eyeballs are.
Yet, while some well-known newspapers – such as the New York Times, the Washington Post, and the United Kingdom-based Guardian – have developed a robust Internet presence themselves, it is not enough.
In the Guardian’s case, the site receives an impressive 38 million unique visitors per day, compared to a print circulation of just 200,000 copies.
But those online visitors read for free, leaving the Guardian hemorrhaging money.
It doesn’t help that web advertising revenues – which, for most newspapers, account for only 10-15% of total revenues – can’t compete with the print-ad revenues of the past.
All of this has generated a distinct sense of uncertainty at journalism schools.
Last year, for the third year in a row, the CareerCast survey identified “newspaper reporter” as the worst career a young person could pursue in the US.
(Full, and somewhat rueful, disclosure: one of my sons is a journalist at the Washington Post.)
Yet, in India, the printed word on pulped trees remains an amazingly healthy industry.
India now has the world’s largest number of paid newspapers, and the number continues to grow, from 5,767 in 2013 to 7,871 in 2015.
Over those same two years, 50 newspapers ceased publication in the US, which has less than a quarter of India’s print papers.
Moreover, figures for newspaper readership released by the Audit Bureau of Circulation (ABC) this month show that, over the last decade, newspaper circulation has grown significantly in India, from 39.1 million copies in 2006 to 62.8 million in 2016 – a 60% increase, for which there is no parallel in the world.
Comparable data for the most recent year available, 2015, show that while newspaper circulation grew by 12% in India, it fell in almost every other major media market: by 12% in the UK, 7% in the US, and 3% in Germany and France.
The robustness of India’s print-newspaper industry cannot be attributed to lack of growth in Internet access: in the last decade, the share of the population with Internet access rose from less than 10% to some 30%.
So what does explain India’s thriving newspaper market?
One basic factor is India’s rising literacy rate, which has climbed to 79%, owing largely to improvement in the “cow belt” of the northern states – the Hindi-speaking heartland.
In the 1960s, when Hindi speakers were overwhelmingly less literate than those who read in English, Malayalam, and Bengali, Hindi newspapers had low circulations.
Today, they are on top: for the second decade in a row, Hindi newspapers experienced the fastest growth, with average circulation soaring at a compounded annual growth rate of 8.78% since 2006.
Economic development has also helped India’s newspaper industry.
Many newly affluent Indians get their national and international news from television.
But events close to home are best covered in the local dailies.
And, indeed, newspapers remain the best way to reach this segment of Indian society.
To be sure, most leading news outlets in India have been developing their digital offerings.
They have created mobile apps to download the news from their sites, and they increasingly treat their readers to short takes of digestible news briefs tailored to the small screens of hand-held devices.
But, for many serious readers, such options are no substitute for the look and feel of a printed newspaper article.
Printed newspapers offer the added advantage of reliability, in a country where Internet access cannot be guaranteed all the time, owing to still-patchy electricity supplies, which cause frequent blackouts even in the capital.
News junkies still need a tangible paper that can be read in the sunlight without a fully charged battery.
Given all of this, it may not be quite so surprising that advertisers in India have remained loyal to the appeal of newspaper ink over the flickering cursor.
In sharp contrast with the Western experience, advertising remains the Indian newspaper industry’s main source of revenue.
Of course, this trend may not last forever.
But, for now, India’s newspapers are in no danger of becoming financially unviable.
While growth in digital advertising expenditure is surging, at an annual rate of nearly 30%, it still comprises just 8% of India’s total ad spending.
Meanwhile, TV and print advertising revenue are also growing, at 8% and 4.5%, respectively.
The differential, ABC predicts, will level out by 2021, with advertising revenues for print and digital media reaching parity.
But even then, India’s print media will enjoy a healthy stream of advertising revenue that their Western counterparts can only dream about.
So India’s print media story continues to be a happy one.
And a robustly growing India will remain paradise for newspaper mavens for a while yet.
There are still 280 million people yet to become literate.
And when they get there, they will want their own newspapers, too.
India’s Deadly Cities
SINGAPORE – China and India are driving Asia’s population and urbanization trends.
According to a 2010 McKinsey study, the two countries are expected to account for 62% of the growth in the continent’s urban population between 2005 and 2025, and a staggering 40% of such growth worldwide.
Statistics like these underscore the urgency of urban planning and growth management.
But it is equally important to acknowledge the critical differences between the two countries.
Variations in their urban growth paths, as well as differences in their approaches to environmental policy, are likely to make India’s population challenges far more difficult to address.
China may be home to 20% of humanity, but for more than two decades its fertility rate has been lower than the “replacement” level (that required to maintain the current population), with population growth expected to turn negative within the next two decades.
As a result, India, where population growth is projected to remain positive for the foreseeable future, is poised to become the world’s most populous country.
Most projections have India’s population exceeding that of China by 2022.
Indeed, over the next 35 years, India is expected to add more than 400 million urban residents (more than the entire population of the United States), while China will add just 292 million.
For the first time, the majority of Indians will be living in cities – a significant transformation for a country whose rural population currently constitutes two-thirds of the total.
India’s two largest urban centers – Delhi and Mumbai – are often described as emerging global megacities.
Delhi is already the world’s second most populous city, and it is expected to close the gap with Tokyo, the world’s largest city, almost entirely by 2030.
When population growth on this scale is combined with rapid urbanization, the associated environmental and social impacts become a formidable policy challenge.
In 2014, the World Health Organization (WHO) determined that Delhi has the world’s worst air quality (based on concentration of fine particulate matter), with Indian cities occupying the top four spots and 13 of the top 18.
China has been frequently – and often justifiably – criticized for poor environmental policies.
But, according to McKinsey, China has been more proactive than India in planning for rapid urbanization, demonstrating that it has the capacity and the resources to address environmental challenges.
In new cities across the country, urban plans already take into account such concerns, with riparian greenways and urban nature reserves complementing infrastructure projects that have environmental benefits (for example, extensive mass-transit networks).
By contrast, India’s cities have grown haphazardly, with little consideration of the functioning of urban systems as a whole.
The country’s urban areas often lack adequate regional transport networks, for example.
Large swaths of informal settlements have emerged in vacant inner-city districts and suburban peripheries, compromising environmental conditions, public health, and personal safety.
Land-use patterns interweave industrial and residential districts, exposing vulnerable (and growing) populations to a host of negative spillover effects.
The differences between urban development in China and India are clear not only in the substance of policy, but also in the two countries’ governance styles.
China’s leaders are placing heavy emphasis on pollution control.
In advance of the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, the authorities are pushing for a regionally integrated plan to balance economic growth with environmental management, including the greening of manufacturing processes and the elimination of “excess capacity” in energy production.
Such multi-jurisdictional efforts require strong coordination and a stable vision, which China’s hierarchal governance system provides.
In India, by contrast, the central government has no role in managing air pollution, which is a state-level responsibility.
Whatever Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s administration decides to do, state governments under the control of different parties are likely to oppose his policies, or fail to devote adequate attention and resources to them.
According to the WHO, of the 4.3 million annual deaths resulting from “indoor air pollution” (burning of solid fuels), nearly one-third (1.3 million) occur in India.
A recent report argues that more stringent environmental regulation would add 3.2 years to Indians’ life expectancy.
This tangible welfare gain would also include economic benefits.
The resulting addition of more than two billion “life years” represents a significant amount of human productivity, creativity, and uncompensated contributions to families and society.
By failing to address the impacts of rapid urbanization adequately, India is leaving these benefits unclaimed.
A good-faith, well-publicized official declaration would signal to India’s citizens and the world that the country intends to save its growing population from the life-shortening effects of urban environmental degradation.
It would also provide a roadmap for improving the quality of life in India’s cities, benefiting local residents both directly and indirectly (by inducing foreign investment).
India’s competitive advantages in the new global economy are well known.
But transformative social progress will be possible only if the country launches a more comprehensive effort to address pathologies long brushed off as the unavoidable collateral damage of economic growth.
India Stops Turning the Other Cheek
NEW DELHI – For two and a half decades, Pakistan has pursued a policy of inflicting on India “death by a thousand cuts” – bleeding the country through repeated terrorist attacks, rather than attempting an open military confrontation which it cannot win against India’s superior conventional forces.
The logic is that India’s response to this tactic would always be tempered by its desire not to derail its ambitious economic development plans, as well as the Indian government’s unwillingness to face the risk of a nuclear war.
But this predictable and repetitive pattern of India-Pakistan relations was suddenly disrupted on September 29, when India’s Director-General of Military Operations (DGMO), Lieutenant-General Ranbir Singh, announced that Indian commandos had conducted “surgical strikes” across the Line of Control (LoC) in Kashmir, the de facto international border between the two countries.
The DGMO stated that the strikes, in the early hours of that morning, had destroyed terrorist “launch pads” and eliminated significant numbers of militants poised to cross over for attacks on the Indian side, as well as some who were protecting them (presumably a reference to Pakistani soldiers).
The Indian public and the country’s notoriously fractious political class reacted with great pride to the news, unanimously hailing the decisive action as long overdue.
For the preceding quarter-century, Indians had watched helplessly as their attempts at peace-making with their belligerent, military-dominated neighbor had collapsed repeatedly, thanks to terrorist attacks from Pakistan that the government in Islamabad seemed unable or unwilling to prevent.
The most horrific of these attacks, the assaults on multiple locations in Mumbai, starting on November 26, 2008, killed 166 innocent civilians.
But India confined its response to diplomatic action.
This exercise of “strategic restraint” in the face of repeated Pakistani assaults – partly in order to avoid provoking a full-fledged war with its nuclear-armed neighbor – had left many Indians seething in impotent fury.
It seemed to them that Pakistani terrorists could strike at will in India, with the government’s reluctance to hit back guaranteeing the killers’ impunity.
In January, militants struck across the frontier at the Indian base in Pathankot.
As usual, India tempered its response, even inviting Pakistan to join in an official investigation of the attack.
The Pakistanis sent over a team of military and intelligence experts, which examined the site of the assaults, went home, and proclaimed it a false-flag operation intended to inculpate an innocent Pakistan.
Indians, sickened by this perfidy, found themselves mourning again in September, when another cross-border assault killed 18 soldiers at an Army base in Uri.
Still, there seemed little Indians could do – until the DGMO’s statement announcing a decisive military response.
Pakistani reactions were a curious mixture, ranging from dismissive declarations (backed by orchestrated bus tours of journalists to selected parts of the LoC) that no surgical strikes had even occurred, to angry statements declaring that irresponsible Indian firing across the LoC had killed two Pakistani soldiers.
For once, the Pakistani military appeared to have been caught off guard by Indian action.
Indians braced themselves for the international community’s disapproval – the fear of nuclear war between the sub-continental neighbors usually dominates world opinion whenever bilateral tensions flare.
But this time, thanks in part to the DGMO’s measured and precise statement and an absence of military triumphalism in India’s official tone (the braggadocio of the ruling party’s publicists came later), the world seemed to consider India’s response justifiable.
Pakistani attempts to seek support against India were widely rebuffed, with Pakistan’s usual supporters, China and the US, mildly calling for both sides to defuse the tensions.
In the days following the strikes, fears of further military escalation have subsided.
India also tightened the diplomatic screws on its recalcitrant neighbor, persuading other members of the South Asian Association for Regional Co-operation (SAARC) to call off a planned summit in Islamabad as punishment for Pakistan’s bad behavior.
India’s government also announced that it was undertaking a review of the Indus Waters Treaty, under which India has conceded to Pakistan, on generous terms, the waters of the Indus River, which originates in India, not even using the share to which it is entitled.
It has since emerged that the operation announced by Singh was not India’s first military strike across the LoC; several had occurred under the previous government as well, in response to military raids on Indian territory.
But the strikes were the first to be announced publicly, providing a clear signal of intent and a bold statement that business as usual – Pakistani pinpricks followed by Indian inaction – is no longer to be expected.
With its calibrated and targeted strikes, India has made clear that inaction is not the only possible response to terrorist provocations.
It is a brave and slightly risky strategy, because it obliges India to pursue a similar course of action when the next significant terrorist strike occurs.
Still, a country that refuses to suffer repeated body blows earns more respect than one whose restraint can be interpreted as weakness.
If this determination, and Pakistan’s ensuing diplomatic isolation, prompts Pakistani generals to rethink their policy of sponsoring terrorism as an instrument of state policy, peace between the neighbors could once again become a possibility.
But, for India, such hopes have been betrayed too often in the recent past for it to continue to turn the other cheek.
India’s Urban Awakening
WASHINGTON, DC – When the United Kingdom became the first country in the world to undergo large-scale urbanization in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the process transformed its economy and society.
Today, India is facing a similar transformation, only it is happening at 100 time the pace.
By 2030, India’s urban population will reach 600 million people, twice the size of America’s.
For India, rapid urbanization is particularly vital to enable the country to take full advantage of the demographic dividend afforded by its young population.
With 12 million more people joining the country’s labor force every year, the potential of that dividend is huge.
As the urbanization process continues, connectivity, proximity, and diversity will accelerate knowledge diffusion, spark further innovation, and enhance productivity and employment growth.
For all of its benefits, however, rapid urbanization also poses enormous challenges, from managing congestion and pollution to ensuring that growth is inclusive and equitable.
As a latecomer to urbanization, India will benefit from technological innovations – including digital technologies, cleaner energy, innovative construction materials, and new modes of transport – that will enable it to leapfrog some of its more developed counterparts.
But taking advantage of those technologies will require effective policies, including smart infrastructure investments and measures to make cities more competitive, particularly in modern industries.
Making its cities more competitive will require India to decide whether to emphasize specialization (with an industry concentrated in a particular city) or diversification (with each city home to a range of industries, roughly in line with the national average).
This is no easy choice: the debate over which approach is better has been raging for nearly a century.
In 1991, around the time India’s economic liberalization began, the country’s cities tended toward specialization.
But, in recent years, there has been a notable shift toward diversification, with some major urban centers, like Mumbai and Bangalore, experiencing the largest and fastest shifts away from specialization.
Specialization tends to be much higher in traditional industries than in modern industries.
Though some modern industries – like office accounting and computing machinery, and radio, television, and communication equipment – tend to be located in more specialized districts, roughly three-quarters of Indian districts with higher specialization levels rely on traditional industries.
Of India’s 600 districts, those that remain the most specialized are Kavaratti (water transport), Darjiling (paper products), Panchkula (office accounting and computing machinery), and Wokha (wood products).
Though India’s specialization levels were much higher than those in the United States in the early 1990s, the two countries have converged over time.
All of this suggests that, as technology continues to advance, so will diversification – a trend that will shape future urbanization patterns in India.
This bodes well for employment, because more diversified cities and districts tend to experience greater job growth.
Initial clusters of modern services have also experienced abnormally high employment growth since 2000.
And there’s more good news: the strongest job gains due to diversification are occurring in rural areas and among small enterprises, suggesting that India’s urbanization can bring inclusive growth and prosperity.
Evidence also shows that high growth rates, which support poverty reduction, are concentrated in the rural areas of particular districts.
Taking full advantage of these positive trends, however, will require India to boost infrastructure investment.
Despite a slowdown in the manufacturing sector’s growth – a trend mirrored in much of the rest of the world – urbanization has continued to accelerate in India, especially in districts with access to better infrastructure.
In the developing world, a billion people lack access to electricity and roads, and more than a half-billion lack reliable access to safe drinking water.
Addressing these deficiencies is critical to development – and India is no exception.
Access to better infrastructure will enable millions more entrepreneurs, especially women, to benefit from the country’s urban awakening.
The key to success will be to improve the efficiency of public spending, while attracting more private investment.
There is certainly an economic incentive for private actors to channel their money toward developing-country infrastructure.
After all, high-income countries, where populations are aging rapidly, often have an excess of savings ready to be allocated to high-yield investments.
Lower-income countries, with their younger populations and large infrastructure needs, provide just such opportunities.
As it stands, however, less than 1% of the $68 trillion managed by pension funds, life insurance companies, and others are channeled toward infrastructure projects.
And, given the low risk appetite among investors, not to mention the small size of city-level projects, municipal governments will struggle to raise that share.
But it isn’t impossible.
What is needed is visionary leadership at the local level, with municipal governments identifying infrastructure projects that promote entrepreneurship, increase their cities’ competitiveness, and promote regional development by strengthening urban-rural connectivity.
Those governments should also leverage their assets, including land; mobilize user revenue; and modify financial regulations and incentives to increase investors’ risk appetite.
Add to that greater technical and financial capacity, and it would become much easier to attract the needed private funds and build partnerships benefiting India’s urban transformation.
India has all of the tools it needs to advance its urbanization process in a way that promotes inclusive and sustainable growth.
It must use them wisely.
Bottling Indonesia’s Gini
JAKARTA – When Indonesia declared independence from Dutch rule in 1945, the country’s founder, Sukarno, called on his people to build a nation that would “stand in strength,” eternally united.
That mantra – unity and strength – helped shape the country’s future, including its approach to economic development.
During much of Indonesia’s early history, its egalitarian distribution of wealth and assets set it apart from its neighbors.
But seven decades later, the legacy of equality is fading.
If Indonesia is to remain one of Asia’s most robust economies, it is essential that its current leadership recommit to narrowing the socioeconomic gap.
During much of the 1970s and 1980s, Indonesia’s low level of income inequality helped raise living standards and reduce poverty.
In 1970, just 25 years after independence, the country managed an enviable distribution of wealth among a diverse population, with a Gini coefficient (a common measure of income inequality) of 0.35 (with zero representing maximum equality).
By comparison, neighboring Malaysia had a Gini coefficient of 0.50.
Indonesia’s remained roughly the same for decades.
But, since the Asian financial crisis in 1997, income gaps have widened throughout the region, and in Indonesia in particular, where social welfare programs have barely stemmed the rise in inequality.
This year, Indonesia’s Gini coefficient is around 0.39, only slightly better than the 0.41 recorded in 2014.
To economists like us, this trend is deeply worrying.
Because persistent high or rising inequality can contribute to political instability and undermine social cohesion, it is critical that Indonesia address it.
Paradoxically, Malaysia’s experience is instructive.
In Malaysia, income inequality is no longer primarily a function of ethnicity, or the rural-urban divide, as it once was.
Thanks to successful redistribution strategies adopted during the 1970s and 1980s, average per capita income increased, and poverty rates fell dramatically.
Though wealth distribution remains a major concern, Malaysia’s Gini coefficient has been on a steady glide toward greater equality since the mid-1970s; in 2014, for example, it dropped to 0.40 for the first time ever, (though this figure remains higher than the average for OECD economies).
Indonesia is moving in the opposite direction.
Not only does it have one of the highest levels of wealth inequality in the world; it also suffers deep regional disparities.
The country’s poorer eastern provinces, which have a history of ethnic violence, lag behind the rest of the country on human development indicators, infrastructure quality, and access to education.
Despite the country’s overall progress, food insecurity and child malnutrition remain serious issues in the east.
In other words, it is not just Indonesia’s income distribution that concerns us, but how unequal access to health care, education, and social services has become.
Our concern is widely shared.
Last month, scholars, practitioners, and policymakers from around the world gathered at the Indonesian Development Forum to explore solutions to the many forms of inequality that are affecting Indonesia today.
The challenges are complex, and discussions focused on the need for multipronged solutions.
As Columbia University’s Jeffrey D. Sachsnoted, greater investment in education, and more effective wealth redistribution strategies, are the key areas that Indonesia’s government must focus on.
The classroom is the foundation of sustainable development everywhere.
Access to education is one of the best ways for poor or disadvantaged youth to become economically productive and climb out of poverty.
Unfortunately, Indonesia’s public schools, especially in the east, are struggling with teacher absenteeism.
Children who want to learn simply cannot when their instructors do not show up.
Broadening access to education is not only about boosting enrollment rates; it also requires ensuring accountability and improving service quality.
Still, reforming the education sector alone will not be enough to close Indonesia’s wealth gap.
Strategies that the government should consider include expanding social protection; creating more vocational-training programs; and overhauling the tax system.
In many OECD countries, redistributive policies, like tax breaks and expansion of welfare benefits, have helped reduce inequality.
If Indonesia is to hit the targets set by the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals for reducing inequality by 2030, it must follow these countries’ example.
There are many reasons to be hopeful.
Bambang Brodjonegoro, Indonesia’s Minister of National Development Planning, has helped make social inequality a key agenda item, following the direction of President Joko Widodo.
This time next year, the Indonesia Development Forum will meet again to gauge progress in our efforts to tackle regional inequality.
Clearly, the political will exists to restore greater equality to Indonesia’s economy.
If current leaders can remain as focused on their vision as the country’s founders were on theirs, Indonesia will again serve as a model of unity and strength for the region.
Inequality Comes to Asia
SEOUL – From China to India, Asian countries’ rapid economic expansion has lifted hundreds of millions of people out of poverty in recent decades.
Yet the income distribution has lately worsened, with inequality now potentially even more severe in Asia than in the developed economies of the West.
From 1990 to 2012, the net Gini coefficient – a common measure of (post-tax and post-transfer) income inequality – increased dramatically in China, from 0.37 to 0.51 (zero signifies perfect equality and one represents perfect inequality).
It rose in India as well, from 0.43 to 0.48.
Even the four “Asian Tigers” – Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan – which had previously grown “with equity,” have lately faced rising inequality.
In South Korea, for example, the share of income held by the top 10% rose from 29% in 1995 to 45% in 2013.
This trend is being driven largely by the same forces that have fueled Asia’s economic growth in recent decades: unbridled globalization and technological progress.
Increasingly open borders have made it easier for businesses to find the cheapest locations for their operations.
In particular, China’s entry into global markets has put downward pressure on the wages of low-skill production workers elsewhere.
Meanwhile, new technologies raise demand for skilled workers, while reducing demand for their less-skilled counterparts – a trend that fuels the expansion of the wage gap between skilled and unskilled.
Capital owners also reap major benefits from technological progress.
In short, as the Nobel laureate Angus Deaton has acknowledged, by creating new opportunities for a certain group of millions of people, while subjecting an enormous number of people to wage stagnation, unemployment, and economic precarity, globalization and technological innovation have helped to widen the gap between the haves and have-nots.
Exacerbating this trend, income inequality often goes hand in hand with inequality of opportunity.
With limited educational and economic prospects, talented youth from disadvantaged backgrounds end up running in place.
As inequality becomes increasingly entrenched, it can erode the consensus in favor of pro-growth economic policies, undermine social cohesion, and spur political instability.
To avoid such a future, Asian countries need to change the rules of the game, providing opportunities for youth, whatever their background, to ascend the income ladder.
Market mechanisms are not enough to achieve this.
Governments must take action, complementing their pro-growth policies with policies aimed at ensuring that the gains are shared much more equally and sustainably.
To be sure, some Asian governments have been attempting to tackle inequality with progressive redistribution policies.
For example, South Korea’s government recently announced that it will raise the minimum wage next year by 16.4%, to 7,530 won ($6.70) per hour, and up to 55% above its current level by 2020.
It will also raise tax rates for the highest income earners and companies.
But, while such measures have strong public support, they could end up hurting the economy, by reducing business investment, for example, and impeding job creation.
In fact, the first rule of thumb in combating today’s inequality should be that simplistic egalitarian policies are not a permanent solution – and may, in fact, have adverse long-term consequences.
Consider the Venezuelan government’s decision, in the late 1990s, to implement populist redistributive policies, without addressing the economy’s overreliance on the oil industry and lack of competitiveness.
That choice has pushed the country to the edge of bankruptcy, while fueling large-scale social unrest and political turmoil.
Venezuela’s national catastrophe should serve as a warning to everyone.
The best way to enhance both equity and growth is effective development of human capital, which not only supports higher incomes today, but also ensures intergenerational mobility tomorrow.
This requires enhanced social safety nets and redistributive tax-and-transfer programs, as well as access to quality education for all.
The good news is that many East Asian economies are already investing more in public education, in order to expand opportunities for all population groups.
But more must be done.
Asia needs to improve further the quality of its higher education as well, reforming curricula to ensure that young people are getting the knowledge and skills they need to prepare them for the labor market.
Meanwhile, the labor market should be made more efficient and flexible, so that it can match people with the right jobs and reward them adequately.
As technology continues to transform the economy, life-long education and training is needed to enable workers to keep up.
Promoting the participation of girls and women in education and economic activity is also important.
Furthermore, governments should create an environment that fosters small innovative startups.
And, of course, they should sustain pro-growth policies that boost overall job creation and reduce unemployment, while rejecting barriers to trade or innovation.
In today’s charged political environment, there is a growing temptation to reject globalization and embrace populist redistribution policies that could end up doing far more harm than good.
Asia’s leaders must do better if they are to realize the true promise of “growth with equity.”
The Global Security Threat of Antimicrobial Resistance
SEATTLE – Today we are faced with the harsh reality that the treatment or prevention of infectious diseases has not made quantum advances since the early successes of vaccines and antimicrobial therapies.
In a sense, the world is headed backward, as once-treatable microbes become resistant to existing therapies, and new infections for which there are no effective interventions continue to arise.
The situation represents a serious and imminent threat to the world.
Witness the global impact of the 2014 Ebola crisis in West Africa or the 2003 SARS outbreak, which jeopardized even wealthy economies like Singapore and Canada.
The emergence of a highly lethal and rapidly spreading antimicrobial-resistant infection would lead to untold numbers of deaths and unimaginable misery.
The consequences could be similar in magnitude to a large-scale terrorist attack.
Communities could be walled off, national borders closed, and travel could be restricted or even suspended.
Health systems could disintegrate or collapse, as could economies.
The possibility of such an apocalyptic scenario suggests that the threat of infectious diseases – either from microbes that develop resistance to existing therapies or new microbes that emerge – is among the most important challenges that humankind faces.
It is not just a public health risk; it is a threat to national and global security.
Thus, it must be met with a comprehensive and effective solution.
The research and development required to produce new medicines or vaccines is time-consuming, often taking more than a dozen years.
It is also very expensive, costing hundreds of millions of dollars for every new product.
Moreover, there is no guarantee of success; indeed, for each successful product, there are as many as nine equally promising candidates that fail.
Given the risks involved, it is not surprising that pharmaceutical companies are very careful in their choice of investments in new drug or vaccine programs, selecting only those that promise financial gains sufficient to cover the costs of both successes and failures and provide a reasonable return on the required investment.
Many ideas have emerged to address this investment problem, such as offering prizes for successful products, creating new incentives for industry investments, and establishing novel funding mechanisms to support research to address emerging infectious threats.
All have merit and would have some impact, but they would lead to incremental advances at best.
A more ambitious solution is needed.
Almost every country is prepared to channel a large percentage of its GDP toward investments in national defense or security.
The global threat of emerging or resistant infections must be viewed first and foremost in that context, with all countries committed to providing financing, intellectual capital, and available resources to support the discovery, development, manufacture, stockpiling, and equitable distribution of new antimicrobial agents and vaccines.
Unless countries recognize the risks they face, they are unlikely to make such a commitment.
It might help to inform them that the estimated cost of emerging global infectious threats is $60 billion per year; if investments are made upfront, the total costs could be much smaller.
Country investments should be pooled to create a substantial pipeline of products to combat infectious threats.
There are many ways this could be done.
The easiest would be to spread the money around to scientists in academia, product-development partnerships, biotech firms, and larger pharmaceutical companies as opportunities arise.
This might allow existing processes to move forward with new momentum based on the availability of new funds.
Unfortunately, history suggests that this wouldn’t lead to much progress beyond the state of the pipeline today.
An alternative would be to create a full-fledged, global, not-for-profit pharmaceutical company with a research budget equal to that of the world’s top five for-profit companies, and with the singular objective of creating a pipeline of products to address the challenge of infectious threats.
As with any of its for-profit peers, the management and scientific talent to undertake this effort would have to be the best available, and attracting it would require competitive compensation.
The management team would be held accountable for its performance by a board of investors, comprising representatives of countries that provide the funding and scientists who provide the intellectual capital.
In keeping with industry practice, the pipelines would have to be built with a combination of internal research and in-licensing or acquisition of external innovation.
Adequate infrastructure for clinical trials would have to be built to support research not only in developed countries, but also in remote regions where some of the infectious threats that the world faces are likely to emerge.
The new company’s work would be aided by prior agreements among regulatory agencies on the requirements for registration of new products, among intellectual-property holders on waiving royalty rights, and among governments on liability-protection for the company and compensation for the victims of unexpected adverse reactions to new products. The international community would have to increase available manufacturing capacity, create new distribution channels, and reserve storage capacity for stockpiling products that have no immediate application.
It goes without saying that this would be a complicated undertaking, with many details to be worked out.
But somehow we must suspend disbelief and take action now, lest we be caught off-guard against an imminent global threat.
This is a battle we cannot afford to lose.
Intellectual Property for the Twenty-First-Century Economy
NEW YORK – When the South African government attempted to amend its laws in 1997 to avail itself of affordable generic medicines for the treatment of HIV/AIDS, the full legal might of the global pharmaceutical industry bore down on the country, delaying implementation and exacting a human cost.
South Africa eventually won its case, but the government learned its lesson: it did not try again to put its citizens’ health and wellbeing into its own hands by challenging the conventional global intellectual property (IP) regime.
Until now.
The South African cabinet is preparing to finalize an IP policy that promises to expand access to medicines substantially. South Africa will now undoubtedly face all manner of bilateral and multilateral pressure from wealthy countries.
But the government is right, and other developing and emerging economies should follow in its footsteps.
Over the last two decades, there has been serious pushback from the developing world against the current IP regime.
In large part, this is because wealthy countries have sought to impose a one-size-fits-all model on the world, by influencing the rulemaking process at the World Trade Organization (WTO) and forcing their will via trade agreements.
The IP standards advanced countries favor typically are designed not to maximize innovation and scientific progress, but to maximize the profits of big pharmaceutical companies and others able to sway trade negotiations.
No surprise, then, that large developing countries with substantial industrial bases – such as South Africa, India, and Brazil – are leading the counterattack.
These countries are mainly taking aim at the most visible manifestation of IP injustice: the accessibility of essential medicines.
In India, a 2005 amendment created a unique mechanism to restore balance and fairness to patenting standards, thereby safeguarding access.
Overcoming several challenges in domestic and international proceedings, the law has been found to comply with WTO standards.
In Brazil, early action by the government to treat people with HIV/AIDS resulted in several successful negotiations, lowering drug prices considerably.
These countries are fully justified in opposing an IP regime that is neither equitable nor efficient.
In a new paper, we review the arguments about the role of intellectual property in the process of development.
We show that the preponderance of theoretical and empirical evidence indicates that the economic institutions and laws protecting knowledge in today’s advanced economies are increasingly inadequate to govern global economic activity, and are poorly suited to meet the needs of developing countries and emerging markets.
Indeed, they are inimical to providing for basic human needs such as adequate health care.
The central problem is that knowledge is a (global) public good, both in the technical sense that the marginal cost of someone using it is zero, and in the more general sense that an increase in knowledge can improve wellbeing globally.
Given this, the worry has been that the market will undersupply knowledge, and research will not be adequately incentivized.
Throughout the late twentieth century, the conventional wisdom was that this market failure could best be rectified by introducing another one: private monopolies, created through stringent patents strictly enforced.
But private IP protection is just one route to solving the problem of encouraging and financing research, and it has been more problematic than had been anticipated, even for advanced countries.
An increasingly dense “patent thicket” in a world of products requiring thousands of patents has sometimes stifled innovation, with more spent on lawyers than on researchers in some cases.
And research often is directed not at producing new products but at extending, broadening, and leveraging the monopoly power granted through the patent.
The US Supreme Court’s 2013 decision that naturally occurring genes cannot be patented has provided a test of whether patents stimulate research and innovation, as advocates claim, or impede it, by restricting access to knowledge.
The results are unambiguous: innovation has been accelerated, leading to better diagnostic tests (for the presence of, say, the BRCA genes related to breast cancer) at much lower costs.
There are at least three alternatives for financing and incentivizing research.
One is to rely on centralized mechanisms of direct support for research, such as the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation in the United States.
Another is to decentralize direct funding through, say, tax credits.
Or a governmental body, private foundation, or research institution can award prizes for successful innovations (or other creative activity).
The patent system can be thought of as awarding a prize.
But the prize impedes the flow of knowledge, reduces the benefits derived from it, and distorts the economy.
By contrast, the final alternative to this system maximizes the flow of knowledge, by maintaining a creative commons, exemplified by open-source software.
Developing economies should use all of these approaches to promote learning and innovation.
After all, economists have recognized for decades that the most important determinant of growth – and thus of gains in human development and welfare – is technological change and the knowledge it embodies.
What separates developing countries from developed countries is as much a gap in knowledge as a gap in resources.
To maximize global social welfare, policymakers should strongly encourage the diffusion of knowledge from developed to developing countries.
But while the theoretical case for a more open system is robust, the world has been moving in the opposite direction.
Over the last 30 years, the prevailing IP regime has erected more barriers to the use of knowledge, often causing the gap between the social returns to innovation and the private returns to widen.
The powerful advanced-economy lobbies that have shaped that regime clearly put the latter first, reflected in their opposition to provisions recognizing intellectual property rights associated with traditional knowledge or biodiversity.
The widespread adoption of today’s stringent IP protection is also historically unprecedented.
Even among the early industrializers, IP protection came very late and often was deliberately eschewed to enable for quicker industrialization and growth.
The current IP regime is not sustainable. The twenty-first-century global economy will differ from that of the twentieth in at least two critical ways.
First, the economic weight of the economies such as South Africa, India, and Brazil will be substantially higher.
Second, the “weightless economy” – the economy of ideas, knowledge, and information – will account for a growing share of output, in developed and developing economies alike.
The rules relating to the “governance” of global knowledge must change to reflect these new realities.
An IP regime dictated by the advanced countries more than a quarter-century ago, in response to political pressure by a few of their sectors, makes little sense in today’s world.
Maximizing profits for a few, rather than global development and welfare for the many, didn’t make much sense then, either – except in terms of the power dynamics at the time.
Those dynamics are changing, and emerging economies should take the lead in creating a balanced IP system that recognizes the importance of knowledge for development, growth, and wellbeing.
What matters is not only the production of knowledge, but also that it is used in ways that put people’s health and welfare ahead of corporate profits.
South Africa’s potential decision to enable access to medicine may be an important milestone on the road toward that goal.
International Norms in Cyberspace
CAMBRIDGE – Last month, the Netherlands hosted the Global Conference on Cyberspace 2015, which brought together nearly 2,000 government officials, academics, industry representatives, and others.
I chaired a panel on cyber peace and security that included a Microsoft vice president and two foreign ministers.
This “multi-stakeholder” conference was the latest in a series of efforts to establish rules of the road to avoid cyber conflict.
The capacity to use the Internet to inflict damage is now well established.
Many observers believe the American and Israeli governments were behind an earlier attack that destroyed centrifuges at an Iranian nuclear facility.
Some say an Iranian government attack destroyed thousands of Saudi Aramco computers.
Russia is blamed for denial-of-service attacks on Estonia and Georgia.
And just last December, US President Barack Obama attributed an attack on Sony Pictures to the North Korean government.
Until recently, cyber security was largely the domain of a small community of computer experts.
When the Internet was created in the 1970s, its members formed a virtual village; everyone knew one another, and together they designed an open system, paying little attention to security.
Then, in the early 1990s, the World Wide Web emerged, growing from a few million users then to more than three billion today.
In little more than a generation, the Internet has become the substrate of the global economy and governance worldwide.
Several billion more human users will be added in the next decade, as will tens of billions of devices, ranging from thermostats to industrial control systems (the “Internet of Things”).
All of this burgeoning interdependence implies vulnerabilities that governments and non-governmental actors can exploit.
At the same time, we are only beginning to come to terms with the national-security implications of this.
Strategic studies of the cyber domain resemble nuclear strategy in the 1950s: analysts are still not clear about the meaning of offense, defense, deterrence, escalation, norms, and arms control.
The term “cyber war” is used very loosely for a wide range of behaviors, ranging from simple probes, website defacement, and denial of service to espionage and destruction.
In this, it reflects dictionary definitions of “war,” which include any organized effort to “stop or defeat something that is viewed as dangerous or bad” (for example, “war on drugs”).
A more useful definition of cyber war is any hostile action in cyberspace that amplifies or is equivalent in effect to major physical violence.
Determining whether an action meets that criterion is a decision that only a country’s political leaders can make.
There are four major categories of cyber threats to national security, each with a different time horizon and (in principle) different solutions: cyber war and economic espionage, which are largely associated with states, and cyber crime and cyber terrorism, which are mostly associated with non-state actors.
The highest costs currently stem from espionage and crime, but the other two may become greater threats over the next decade than they are today.
Moreover, as alliances and tactics evolve, the categories may increasingly overlap.
During the Cold War, ideological competition limited US-Soviet cooperation, but both sides’ awareness of nuclear destructiveness led them to develop a crude code of conduct to avoid military confrontation.
These basic rules of prudence included no direct fighting, no first use of nuclear weapons, and crisis communication, such as the Moscow-Washington hotline and the Accidents Measures and Incidents at Sea agreements.
The first formal arms-control agreement was the 1963 Limited Test Ban Treaty, which can be considered mainly an environmental treaty.
The second major agreement was the 1968 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which aimed at limiting the spread of nuclear weapons.
The US and the Soviet Union perceived both agreements as positive-sum games, because they involved nature or third parties.
Similarly, the most promising areas for early international cooperation on securing cyberspace are problems posed by third parties such as criminals and terrorists.
Russia and China have sought a treaty for broad United Nations oversight of the Internet.
Though their vision of “information security” could legitimize authoritarian governments’ censorship, and is therefore unacceptable to democratic governments, it may be possible to identify and target behaviors that are illegal everywhere.
Limiting all intrusions would be impossible, but one could start with cyber crime and cyber terrorism.
Major states would have an interest in limiting damage by agreeing to cooperate on forensics and controls.
Of course, historical analogies are imperfect.
Obviously, cyber technology is very different from nuclear technology, particularly because non-governmental actors can exploit it much more easily.
Nonetheless, some institutions, both formal and informal, already govern the basic functioning of the Internet.
The US wisely plans to strengthen the non-governmental Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) by having it supervise the Internet “address book.”
There is also the Council of Europe’s 2001 Convention on Cybercrime, with Interpol and Europol facilitating cooperation among national police forces.
And a UN Group of Government Experts has been analyzing how international law relates to cyber security.
It is likely to take longer to conclude agreements on contentious issues such as cyber intrusions for purposes like espionage and preparing the battlefield.
Nonetheless, the inability to envisage an overall cyber arms-control agreement need not prevent progress on some issues now.
International norms tend to develop slowly.
It took two decades in the case of nuclear technology.
The most important message of the recent Dutch conference was that massive cyber vulnerability is now nearing that point.
The Olympics’ Lesser Gods
BERLIN – The Summer Olympic Games are in full swing in Rio.
Every time the world’s top athletes gather for the Games, people everywhere have the opportunity not just to root for their countries, but also to become engrossed by stories of sacrifice and success, of broken bones and broken records.
Beyond the incredible feats of athleticism are powerful triumphs of the spirit, like that of the Syrian refugee swimmer Yusra Mardini, who less than a year ago jumped into the Mediterranean to help push her broken-down dinghy, containing 19 other refugees, to safety in Greece.
In this sense, the Olympic Games are as much about inspiration as they are about competition.
But, thanks to the International Olympic Committee, the Games are also about something much darker.
In fact, the IOC – together with its national branches, as well as the associations representing particular sports – embodies some of the most prominent problems the world is facing today, from inequality to exploitation to sheer hypocrisy among our leaders.
Over the years, the IOC and its national branch organizations have been accused of everything from poor governance to corruption.
Most recently, a Washington Post analysis damningly depicted the chasm between the earnings of the executives who run the show and the athletes who make it.
Many, if not most, athletes perform for little or no money.
Sponsorships can provide funds, but they also include restrictive rules that limit athletes’ ability to raise more money for their training.
As the Olympic sailor Ben Barger noted, the money that the “Olympic Movement” produces “goes to executives first, then administrators, then coaches, and then athletes.”
So, for example, while IOC President Thomas Bach luxuriates rent-free in a lavish hotel suite in Switzerland, US Olympic medalist rower Megan Kalmoe lives close to the poverty line.
Such extremes cast a pall of exploitation over the whole affair.
And the exploitation is not only financial.
The IOC and its partners have a history of ignoring the perils that arise from the relationship between coaches and the young athletes they train – a relationship that has provided fertile ground for manipulation and abuse.
Coaches can use their position of authority to lead young athletes to start doping or to take advantage of them sexually.
As a recent Indianapolis Star report on US women’s gymnastics has revealed, such conduct is rampant, and the national federation overseeing the sport – an Olympic organization – has consistently failed to address it.
But the athletes are not the only ones the IOC disregards; the Committee is also apparently indifferent to how host cities and countries comes to be host cities and countries.
What exactly it takes to win an Olympic bid is fuzzy, though gifts, junkets, and wining and dining clearly factor into it.
Whether Tokyo’s winning bid for the 2020 Olympics was aided by payments to a company linked to the son of the disgraced former world athletics chief Lamine Diack is currently under investigation.
The process may be murky, but the results are clear. In Rio, tens of thousands of Brazilians were displaced to make room for Olympic infrastructure, some of which has been criticized for posing safety hazards.
There is something deeply jarring about the glittering new projects that sit cheek by jowl with the poverty of the favelas and the juxtaposition of extravagant ceremony and the depth of the political and economic crises facing Brazil.
The party goes on, while its host edges toward the abyss.
Clearly, the IOC’s priorities are badly skewed.
Can the Olympic Movement be redeemed?
To answer that question, it is worth considering the experience of FIFA, another non-profit sports organization beset by corruption.
In the two years since the truth about FIFA came to light, the rumblings of change can be heard, as what seemed to be an impenetrable system begins to crumble under the pressure of activists, sponsors, and soccer associations.
The first step is exposure.
The good news is that, nowadays, it is harder than ever to keep such large-scale wrongdoing under wraps, not least because of the efforts of committed journalists and brave whistleblowers.
The testimony of the runner Yuliya Stepanova was the key to exposing Russia’s state-run doping program.
The bad news is that the IOC simply ignored the World Anti-Doping Agency’s report on Russia’s official scheme and stopped well short of banning its national team.
As FIFA’s experience showed, once sponsors become concerned about their reputations, their interests shift.
Now that they have been revealed, the enrichment schemes – which benefit, above all, the sponsors, executives, and a couple of superstar Olympians – are hurting profits. So, too, will continuing to turn a blind eye to powerful countries’ efforts to cheat.
Sponsors must show themselves to be responsive and responsible, saving face by recalling the Olympic spirit.
The rule of law and ethics, built into the fabric of corporate governance, must now take center stage.
The Olympic Games reflect not just who we are, but also who we hope to be.
The system that underpins them has widened the gap between the two.
The IOC has become a monument to some of humanity’s worst tendencies – the greed, hypocrisy, and exploitation that have led so many to distrust institutions.
One hopes that the example of FIFA will help to mark a path to redemption for the IOC, and that the Olympic Movement’s governing body embarks upon it before the flame of what is worthy and inspiring about the Games is snuffed out.
Has Interpol Become a Tool of Oppression?
LONDON – Arrests of journalists in Spain and Ukraine on the basis of Interpol notices have raised serious questions about the methods of the international police agency.
For media professionals in particular, the trends are deeply worrying.
The cases in Spain and Ukraine are not isolated incidents.
Countries opposed to a free press are increasingly using Interpol’s “wanted person” alerts to target and silence journalists who have fled.
Since July, Fair Trials and Reporters Without Borders (RSF) have responded to a number of cases in which reporters have been arrested and detained on the basis of Interpol information.
Countries circulating these orders include Azerbaijan, Turkey, Uzbekistan, and Kazakhstan.
The circulation of wanted person alerts, which include “notices” and “diffusions,” is one of Interpol’s key functions.
These alerts, transmitted to police databases worldwide, identify the subject as a wanted criminal.
These notifications have far-reaching consequences, and as we have learned, can easily be abused.
For example, in recent months, journalists like Hamza Yalçin, Fikret Huseynli, Narzullo Akhunzhonov, and Can Dündar, targeted by their governments for simply doing their jobs, have all been flagged by Interpol.
When used properly, an Interpol alert is a critical tool for fighting global crime.
The subject of an Interpol alert can face lengthy periods in detention while challenging extradition.
Clearing your name can be difficult.
Even when an alert is removed from Interpol’s databases, you can continue to face the threat of arrest when traveling, or be refused visas in a never-ending cycle of persecution.
Wanted person alerts are not the only way that Interpol’s mechanisms are being abused.
In September 2016, Syrian journalist Zaina Erhaim had her passport seized by British border authorities at London’s Heathrow Airport after it was falsely reported stolen in the Interpol system.
Similar efforts to use Interpol to restrict the travel of unfriendly journalists have been reported elsewhere.
Interpol was created in 1923 to help countries coordinate in the fight against cross-border crime and terrorism.
Its mission is simple: to “make the world a safer place.”
But while the goal is noble, not all of its 192 member countries stick to the rules.
Interpol’s members include some of the world’s most oppressive governments, whose leaders routinely misuse their own criminal justice systems to silence free speech and political opposition.
These authoritarian regimes think nothing of using Interpol to target reporters in exile.
When Interpol alerts are misused in this way, oppression gains an international stamp of approval.
This is why tackling abuse of the Interpol system is so crucial.
While it is lamentable that countries like Turkey, China, and Egypt persecute journalists at home, we must not allow Interpol to become complicit in such behavior.
The international community must show its commitment to free speech by making it clear that reporters forced to flee their homelands will be protected and allowed to continue their work.
Interpol has the tools to strengthen its notification systems.
The agency has shown an impressive commitment to change, introducing new rules to protect refugees, for example, and creating a more robust complaints mechanism.
Moreover, the agency’s constitution, which each member country must sign, requires that Interpol not engage in political cases and that its actions respect the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which includes the right to freedom of expression.
And yet countries continue to use Interpol as a means of silencing journalists, and the agency’s leaders aren’t managing to stop them.
Part of the challenge is procedural.
Every year, Interpol issues more than 11,000 “Red Notices” – alerts that ask member countries to locate and arrest an individual pending extradition.
Interpol has started to review these notices before they are sent out.
But countries can get around this by using Interpol to circulate “diffusions” – requests for police cooperation that are less formal than notices, but often produce a similar result.
They are sent to police forces around the world before any formal review is undertaken.
And while Interpol does eventually conduct a review before uploading a diffusion to its database, by then, any damage has already been done.
Clearly there is a need to balance speedy police work with mechanisms that discourage abuse.
But, beyond increased vigilance by the agency itself, what can the international community do?
For starters, member countries should demand that Interpol dedicate resources and funding to an urgent review of the thousands of alerts sitting on its system.
Interpol also needs to reform the diffusion system.
If it cannot recall abusive diffusions from member countries’ databases, it must review them before they are circulated in the first place.
Countries that abuse, or try to abuse, Interpol’s systems, must also be held to account.
And police departments around the world should exercise more caution before acting on an alert they receive through Interpol.
Interpol’s credibility is at stake.
As any newspaper editor knows, audiences will eventually tune out if they are continually bombarded with inaccurate or misleading content.
The same is true for Interpol’s information.
In an increasingly globalized world, international mechanisms like Interpol are essential to keeping us safe.
But if these organizations are hijacked by those committed to silencing free speech, they risk becoming part of the problems they were created to solve.
Could the Iranian Economy Sink Rouhani?
CAMBRIDGE – For a “managed democracy,” Iran holds remarkably unpredictable presidential elections.
And the upcoming election on May 19 is no exception, given that the incumbent, Hassan Rouhani, is facing a tough conservative challenger.
Rouhani’s opponent, Ebrahim Raisi, is a high-ranking cleric who is considered to be a possible successor to Iran’s Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
Raisi’s campaign has received a boost following the withdrawal of another hardliner, Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf, the mayor of Tehran, who garnered one-third as many votes as Rouhani in the 2013 election.
When Rouhani was elected in 2013, Iran was suffering from 35% inflation, the national currency had depreciated by two-thirds in the previous year, and international sanctions were crippling the economy.
Oil exports and output of automobiles – Iran’s leading manufacturing industry – had each declined by two-thirds, and restless industrial workers were demanding back pay.
Rouhani had campaigned against former President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad’s populist policies, promising to put jobs and production before redistribution.
He said that he would control inflation, negotiate a deal with the West to end the sanctions, and restore macroeconomic stability.
By any reasonable standard, he delivered: inflation is in the single digits for the first time in three decades; sanctions have been lifted in accordance with the 2015 nuclear deal; and the exchange rate has been stable for four years.
But, unfortunately for Rouhani, many Iranians who had expected their living standards and employment prospects to improve as a result of these successes are now feeling disappointed.
To be sure, the economy has started to grow again, after contracting for two years.
But there is disagreement about the current recovery’s breadth and durability.
Because much of the recent growth has come from a doubling in oil production, it has not increased most household incomes, or created new employment opportunities.
Thus, International Monetary Fund monitors who visit Iran twice a year have projected 6.6% growth for the 2016-2017 fiscal year, but only half that for the 2017-2018 fiscal year.
Survey data show that, outside of Tehran, average real (inflation-adjusted) household expenditures fell during the first two years of Rouhani’s term, while poverty rose.
In the 2015-2016 fiscal year, there were almost one million more people below the poverty line than when Rouhani took office.
And yet these outcomes do not necessarily amount to broken promises.
When voters rallied behind Rouhani’s call for lower inflation, they may not have realized that prices rising at a slower rate would also mean slower income growth.
And the lay public was not alone: even one of Rouhani’s economic advisers initially boasted that people were 20% better off because the rate of inflation had declined by 20 percentage points.
Moreover, Rouhani has pursued a tight fiscal policy that deepened the recession and delayed the recovery.
He has kept the government’s rate of fixed investment at around 5% of GDP, which is twice what it was under Ahmadinejad, but still too low.
Government fixed investment is the traditional driver of economic growth in Iran, and has been as high as 20% of GDP in good times.
Making matters worse, Iran has a major investment bottleneck, owing to collapsing real-estate values and a frozen banking system.
Iran’s banks are still saddled with bad loans forced on them by Ahmadinejad to finance his populist projects.
And the Central Bank of Iran has failed to get credit flowing again, even though it has been pumping money into the economy and increasing liquidity by 26% per year.
As a result, real interest rates have risen to above 10%, choking off private investment.
With the state unwilling to spend, and the private sector unable to borrow, total investment fell by 9% in the first nine months of the 2016-2017 fiscal year, after falling by 17% during the same period the previous year.
Despite renewed economic growth, unemployment actually increased in the last four years.
Although the economy created more than a half-million jobs each year, new entrants to the labor force pushed up the unemployment rate, from 10.1% to 12.1% – and from 24% to 29% for workers aged 15-24.
Khamenei has led the charge against Rouhani’s record on jobs.
In a speech in March marking the Iranian new year, he called for a year of “production and employment,” and urged the next president to create jobs with local resources, rather than look for assistance abroad.
Rouhani’s economic strategy has clearly failed younger Iranians, who account for 60% of the unemployed, and who generally favored him in the 2013 election.
But Iran’s youth will likely overlook Rouhani’s economic-policy shortcomings, and vote for him again, because they prefer his more relaxed social-policy positions to his conservative rival's stern moralizing.
Older Iranians, however, might not be so forgiving.
Youth unemployment affects everyone, but particularly the adults who must house and feed the jobless.
According to 2015-2016 survey data, of the 65% of men under the age of 35 who lived with their parents, 85% were single, and 24% were unemployed.
Marriage and employment are the two defining elements of adult life in Iran.
Without them, many young people have turned to crime and drugs, which has had far-reaching adverse effects.
Rouhani has also hiked energy prices by 50%, without increasing cash transfers to the poor.
We do not know the extent to which the poor supported Rouhani in 2013; but they are less likely to do so this time.
Rouhani severely criticized Ahmadinejad’s cash-transfer policy, which was designed to compensate for lost bread and energy subsidies.
But even if Ahmadinejad’s overzealous attempt to deliver “the oil money to peoples’ dinner tables” added to inflationary pressures, it also seems to have reduced poverty and inequality significantly.
Still, Rouhani is expected to win re-election, not least because every president of the Islamic Republic has served two terms.
But if he loses, his economic policies – which delivered too little, too late – will be to blame.
Trump Is Strengthening Iran’s Radicals
STANFORD – The United States and Iran have rarely agreed on how to proceed with nuclear talks or other elements of their bilateral relations.
But synergies and similarities between two factions – Iranian hardliners and the hawks of the current US administration – are as counterintuitive as they are profound.
Indeed, Donald Trump’s new Iran strategy has given radicals in Tehran reason to celebrate, as they have found in the US president an unwitting ally in their quest for political dominance.
For years, Iran’s “conservative radicals” – a concept that combines extreme conservatism in matters of faith and philosophy with radical views on violence – have argued that negotiation and rapprochement with the US are foolish and futile.
The US, these hardliners believe, is interested only in regime change, and to fight Islam in the region.
This view has led Iran to align more closely with Russia and China.
But as crippling nuclear-related sanctions in recent years brought the Iranian economy to the verge of collapse, Iran’s conservatives were forced to negotiate in good faith with the international community.
Even without sanctions, the Iranian economy would have been under severe strain.
Corruption and mismanagement, along with structural and external challenges – such as falling oil prices, water shortages, and an aging unemployed population – had already weakened economic growth.
The fact that China and Russia joined the most recent round of sanctions had made the radicals’ position less tenable.
But if Iran’s hardliners were frustrated by previous negotiations, their disappointment vanished yesterday.
Trump’s move to challenge the 2015 nuclear deal – formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA – has given them an unanticipated victory.
While the most effective sanctions had already been lifted, and are unlikely to be re-imposed, Iran’s conservatives have gained political points that they can use against their opponents at home.
Within Iran, a powerful coalition of moderate forces – ranging from reformists and dissidents to civil-society actors – has long advocated for a more engaged foreign policy.
Wary of Russia’s influence and uncertain of China’s intentions, these forces have supported a continued Western orientation in economic and political ties.
Moderates advocated for more responsible foreign policy and caution on the country’s nuclear program.
And they sought to deepen ties to the Iranian diaspora, in the hope that closer relationships could help solve some of Iran’s most daunting economic challenges.
Iranian moderates understood that the nuclear deal reached with the international community was flawed.
But they supported it nonetheless, hoping to leverage it for more freedom at home.
President Hassan Rouhani famously promised a domestic version of the deal to heal Iran’s political wounds, and to further address its economic woes.
That pledge reflected Rouhani’s broader effort to challenge and curtail the power of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, which is rooted in the IRGC’s control of large swaths of the Iranian economy.
Now, with Trump’s move, Rouhani’s agenda, and that of the entire moderate coalition, is in jeopardy.
Most of those in the US who supported the nuclear deal were also aware of its flaws.
But they saw the deal as an opportunity to engage Iranians who oppose the conservative radicals.
American supporters believed that the vibrancy of Iranian civil society and social media boded well for the country, and hoped an Iran that was open to global markets would become more liberal politically.
Critics of the deal object that Iran’s testing of ballistic missiles has continued unabated after the JCPOA was enacted.
But it is folly to think that the US can curb Iran’s nuclear and regional activities by unilaterally walking away.
In fact, the deal’s ultimate goal – to slow enrichment of uranium and halt nuclear testing – appears to have worked.
Whatever problem Trump has with the agreement, it is worth remembering that no country can fix what it has rejected.
And rejecting the JCPOA would only encourage the Iranian regime to resume the very activities that the deal was meant to contain or curtail.
Trump’s challenge to the JCPOA will most likely encourage other egregious behavior as well.
One reason for the radicals’ regional shenanigans – such as supporting militias in Yemen, Palestine, and Lebanon – is the belief that confrontation with the US or Israel is inevitable.
Proxy forces like Hezbollah are, from this perspective, a tool either for deterring aggression or for deployment when fighting begins.
It is true that Iran’s proxies have not holstered their guns as a result of the nuclear agreement.
But tensions with the US did diminish.
Now, following Trump’s about-face, the possibility of confrontation between Iran and the US has returned, which will only embolden the resolve of Iran’s proxy forces.
Unilateral US abrogation of the JCPOA is, in short, the worst of all policy options.
No matter what Trump says, there are plenty of people in Iran, and the US, who share this view.
What’s Driving Iran’s Protests?
LONDON – The rapid spread of civil unrest in Iranian towns and cities that began in late December has taken nearly everyone – President Hassan Rouhani’s reform-minded government, many citizens, and observers – by surprise.
Starting in Mashhad, a large religious city in the country’s northeast and a stronghold of Rouhani’s conservative foes, the protests engulfed a number of smaller towns with a speed and ferocity that few could have predicted.
The protests, fueled by the rising cost of living and widening economic and social disparities, quickly morphed into a repudiation of the regime itself.
While much of the anger has been directed at the clerical establishment led by Iran’s Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, reformists have as much at stake as their hardline rivals.
Iranian reformists are not accustomed to being targets of popular frustration, as they are now.
In the country’s presidential elections, political reformers have repeatedly channeled popular discontent into promises of a more hopeful future.
That historic role is at odds with reformers’ current responsibility to restore law and order to Iran’s urban areas.
Rouhani was elected to a second term barely seven months ago, securing an outright majority of 57% of the vote amid high turnout.
Recent events seem to suggest that many young Iranians doubt if Rouhani can deliver greater prosperity and a more moderate version of Islamist rule than that offered by his hardline rivals.
Perhaps the biggest risk posed by the wave of unrest concerns Rouhani’s planned economic reforms.
The protests erupted despite two years of modest improvement in the Iranian economy.
Though squeezed by low world oil prices and anemic inflows of foreign investment, economic indicators have been moving in the right direction since January 2016, when, in the wake of the 2015 deal limiting Iran’s nuclear program, many international sanctions were lifted.
According to the International Monetary Fund, Iran’s GDP is growing at an annual rate of just over 4%, with encouraging indications that in the post-sanction era, growth is broadening to the non-oil sectors.
Last year, growth reached 12.5%, mainly owing to a rebound in oil output and exports.
While inflation remains high, at around 10%, this represents a strong improvement from the heights scaled when sanctions were in place.
There is, of course, no linear relationship between economic indicators and public sentiment.
While conventional wisdom attributes political turmoil and instability to economic hardship, reality is rarely so neat.
In the Middle East, for example, both Iran’s 1979 Islamic Revolution and the Arab Spring uprisings of 2011 were preceded by unprecedented oil-price booms, implying greater prosperity in the region.
Still, the improvements to Iran’s economy following the 2015 nuclear deal have fallen well short of expectations.
The biggest disappointment seems to be that growth has failed to make a dent in Iran’s staggering levels of unemployment.
The total unemployment rate stands at nearly 13%, while youth unemployment – officially measured at 29%, but likely closer to 40% – is among the highest in the world.
Today, this grievance sits at the heart of popular frustration, particularly among disaffected urban youth, who helped ignite the latest round of unrest.
Unemployment is highest among those with university education, particularly women.
While more young Iranian women now enter Iran’s universities compared to their male counterparts, Iran’s rate of female labor-force participation was a paltry 15% last year, down from 20% a decade ago.
Job creation will remain a principal challenge for Rouhani’s government.
Because some 840,000 people are expected to enter the labor market next year alone, simply stabilizing unemployment in the short term will be a tall order.
With more than 40% of the population between the ages of 15 and 34, adding enough jobs in the longer term will be no easier.
Viewed in this context, the recent protests have weakened Iran’s reformers by eroding their monopoly on hope and driving a wedge between the government’s neoliberal policies, intended to address Iran’s economic problems, and its goal of deepening popular support.
And Iran’s reformers also risk losing political ground to their hardline rivals, who can be expected to adopt an iron-fisted approach to security, at the expense of Rouhani’s gradual loosening of restrictions.
There is, however, a silver lining for reformers.
While many Iranians yearn for economic empowerment, many more fear a possible slide into anarchy and chaos.
Unlike during the protests of 2009, and mindful of the generally disappointing outcome of the Arab Spring uprisings, Iran’s middle class has so far exercised caution, observing the demonstrations apprehensively and from a distance.
Paradoxically, it is that fear factor – rather than the hope for change among disaffected Iranians – that may yet rescue Rouhani’s agenda.
The Best Hope for the Iranian People
LONDON – One of the most extraordinary things about the current protests in Iran – the largest since the Green Movement in 2009 – is that the very people that they are directed against may well have been the people who started them.
Iran’s ultra-conservative theocrats appear to have thought that by stoking anger over the economy in their political heartlands, they would undermine the moderate President Hassan Rouhani.
But, if that is the case, they failed to anticipate the depth of the dissatisfaction of the Iranian people with the status quo – especially their own role in it.
To be clear, despite the massive scale of the protests, they are very unlikely to bring down the regime.
Iran’s security forces are too strong and have too much at stake in the current system, which gives them control of vast swaths of the Iranian economy.
Moreover, the protesters are essentially leaderless and lack clear objectives.
No matter how much encouragement Western powers give them, the protests seem all but certain to end with Islamist hardliners retaining their power bases and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps retaining control of most of the state’s assets and security activities.
But that doesn’t mean that nothing will change.
Nor does it mean that the West has no leverage to exercise.
It is possible, for example, that Rouhani will end up stepping down, whether by force or choice.
But this would hardly count as success for the protesters.
After all, Rouhani is the supposedly moderate administrator of a state whose constitution is not, in the eyes of the clerical elite, derived from this earthly realm.
If protecting their government’s religious purity – and their own ill-gotten gains – required brutally repressing their own people and returning Iran to the dark ages, the extremists who would be left in charge would eagerly do it.
Whether Rouhani steps down or not, it is now apparent that the status quo cannot continue indefinitely – indeed, perhaps not for very much longer.
Iranians were told that the nuclear deal concluded in 2015 would lift them out of economic hardship.
But, thanks partly to persistent corruption – Iran ranks in the lowest quartile globally in this area – annual inflation exceeds 10%, and youth unemployment stands at 25%.
According to Gallup, only citizens of Iraq and South Sudan are more pessimistic about their future.
So far, Rouhani has been unwilling or unable to use the power of the presidency to reform Iran.
But, amid the protests, he is more motivated than ever to improve domestic economic conditions.
Should he fail, Iran may face a larger wave of protests, with stronger leadership and clearer objectives.
Any effort to reform Iran’s economy must recognize the costly absurdity of the country’s expansionist foreign policies.
Funding a proxy war in Yemen, propping up a political party and terrorist group in Lebanon, and seeking to dominate Syria and Iraq cost billions of dollars annually.
It should not have come as a surprise when protesters shouted, “Let go of Syria; think about us.”
Iranian citizens are not alone in taking issue with their country’s foreign policy.
Most Western and Middle Eastern governments are also highly concerned about Iran’s behavior, which reflects a rejection of international norms such as respect for national sovereignty.
Iran’s public threats to destroy America and the Gulf states certainly don’t help matters.
Iran’s problematic foreign policy is the result not of mismanagement, but of toxic ideology.
Indeed, two fixed notions underpin it.
First, Iran’s leaders are convinced that global geopolitics is a zero-sum game – a belief shared with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
(That commonality perhaps explains the close alliance that has formed between Russia and Iran.)
Second – and more dangerous – Iran’s leaders believe that they have a God-given right to unite Shia Muslims under a single caliphate.
The result is a hostile regime that views its neighbors’ success as a threat – and is willing to wage war over it.
Iran’s leadership will be extremely reluctant to withdraw from the forward positions the country has gained across the Middle East over the past decade, beachheads which regime hardliners regard as crucial national-security and foreign-policy assets.
Amid the current protests, however, the West has an opportunity to push Iran to suspend its regional ambitions and focus on its desperate domestic situation.
If an agreement is reached, existing sanctions can be reduced; if Iran’s leaders refuse to budge, new sanctions could be introduced.
To be sure, if religious extremists take control of all levels of Iran’s government, appeals based on Iranians’ economic prospects will fall on deaf ears.
But if Rouhani retains the presidency – or another moderate takes his place – there is a chance that such pressure would provide sufficient cover to scale back Iran’s foreign adventurism and reform the domestic economy.
This would minimize the risk of severe violence in Iran, while galvanizing opposition to religious extremists.
Iran is at a turning point.
The world must now send its regime a clear message: stop destabilizing the region and help your own people to prosper.
The Turn of the Kurds
NEW YORK – Returns show a high percentage of Iraq’s estimated eight million Kurds turned out to vote in a referendum on independence for the Kurdistan Region and other areas of the country with a substantial Kurdish population.
An even higher proportion of voters – reported to be above 90% – voted yes.
Much of the world, though, is unsympathetic, and statehood in today’s world depends on recognition by other states.
So what happens now?
To be sure, there is not and should not be any automatic right of self-determination.
It was one thing for people in colonies ruled by governments thousands of miles away and deprived of many of their rights to opt for independence in the wake of World War II.
It is something else altogether for a region to secede from an existing independent country.
A world of frequent secession would be in even greater disarray than the world we already have.
The question then naturally arises: under what circumstances should leaders and populations seeking to leave one country and establish their own be supported?
There is no universally accepted set of standards, but let me suggest some that should be applied:
·         A history that indicates a clear collective identity for the people in question.
·         A compelling rationale, in the sense that the population must be able to demonstrate that the status quo is imposing a large political, physical, and economic price.
·         The population makes clear that it strongly favors a new and separate political status.
·         The new state is viable (the last thing the world needs are more failed states).
·         Secession does not jeopardize the viability of the rump state or the security of neighboring states.
By these standards, there is a persuasive case for Kurdish independence.
The Kurds have a strong sense of collective history and national identity, and failed to achieve statehood after WWI through no fault of their own – even though the case for it was as persuasive as those of other groups whose national hopes were satisfied.
The Kurds of Iraq suffered greatly (including being attacked with chemical weapons) at the hands of Saddam Hussein’s regime.
An independent Kurdistan has the potential to be economically viable, given its energy reserves.
And Iraq without Kurdistan would still be viable, as would other neighboring countries.
Nonetheless, the desire of the Kurds in northern Iraq for a country of their own is mostly being resisted.
Iraq’s central government, worried about the loss of territory and significant oil reserves, strongly opposes Kurdish secession.
Turkey, Iran, and Syria all oppose Kurdish independence anywhere, fearing that their own Kurdish minorities could be “infected” by the “virus” of Kurdish statehood and seek to break away and create a state of their own or join the new Kurdish entity carved from Iraq.
Iraq’s central government has threatened to close its airspace to planes flying to or from the Kurdish region.
And Turkey has threatened to cut off the pipeline on which Kurdistan relies to export oil.
The danger in such moves is that the viability of the new entity (which would be landlocked) could be jeopardized, not to mention the risk of military clashes.
The United States opposes Kurdish independence, concerned that the opposition of the neighboring states could fuel further turmoil in an already turbulent Middle East.
But it is also true that the Kurds meet many of the criteria for statehood, operate a political system with democratic features, and have been a loyal and effective ally against the Islamic State in both Iraq and Syria.
And the opposition of an illiberal Turkey, an imperial Iran, an Iraq heavily influenced by Iran, and a Syrian regime that owes its survival to Iranian and Russian military intervention strengthens the geopolitical argument for Kurdish statehood.
One option for the US and the European Union (which has been similarly cool to the idea of Kurdish independence) would be to support or participate in negotiations between the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) and the Iraqi government in Baghdad.
Such talks could aim for a compromise over how resources and territory might be divided or shared.
Parallel talks involving Turkey and the KRG could address both economic and security concerns.
The US and the EU should also make clear that any support on their part for Kurdish separatism is not a precedent for others.
There are already more than 190 countries, and the emergence of new ones is neither simple nor straightforward.
Each situation needs to be judged on its merits.
Groups have every right to participate in the determination of their future, but not to decide it by themselves.
The Kurds of Iraq have made their preference known; it is neither fair nor sustainable to refuse to take their goal seriously.
Is Evidence-Based Medicine Broken?
LONDON – Evidence-based medicine, as David Sackett and his colleagues wrote in 1996, is “the conscientious, explicit, and judicious use of current best evidence in making decisions about the care of individual patients.”
At first glance, this seems entirely logical; indeed, many would say that this simply could be called “medicine.”
But the approach is generating considerable controversy, with many asserting that it is “broken.”
Last month, when the British Medical Journal asked its readers whether evidence-based medicine is malfunctioning, the responses were almost evenly split: 51% answered positively, and 49% negatively.
The controversy stems from the kind of evidence that is used.
Sackett implies, but does not stipulate, that epidemiological evidence (findings from randomized controlled trials and large-cohort studies carried out over many years) should underpin doctors’ decisions about patients – and, one hopes, in consultation with them.
Epidemiological research studies address questions like, “If 1,000 people with type 2 diabetes were randomly allocated to four groups of 250 people that each received either no treatment (or a placebo), drug A, drug B, or drug C for ten years, how would it impact survival rates, and what, if any, complications and side effects would there be?”
If the trial is conducted properly – it is large enough; people are allocated in a truly random way; and “blind” assessments of the outcomes are conducted – the results should be reliable.
Consider the following scenario: Ten-year survival rates for the four groups are 70%, 71%, 80%, and 82%, respectively, and the proportion of people developing troublesome side effects is 1%, 2%, 5%, and 50%.
Most people trade a small reduction in the chance of survival for a large reduction in the chance of adverse effects; in other words, they would opt for drug B.
In short, evidence-based medicine uses the science of epidemiology to create a clear and structured set of decisions about tests and treatments for individual patients, with the evidence often – and increasingly – being summarized in the form of clinical guidelines.
This is problematic for two main reasons.
For starters, the emphasis on randomized controlled trials as the “gold standard” of evidence has meant that any drug that has outperformed a competitor in a trial may now be classified as “evidence-based.”
Look no further than the glossy ads in medical journals to discover drugs you did not know you needed for diseases that you never knew existed, such as “female sexual arousal disorder” and “adult attention deficit disorder.”
And how many drugs are tested against more natural non-drug therapies – yoga for high blood pressure, for example, or brisk walking for diabetes – before being licensed?
In a sense, evidence-based medicine has been a victim of its own success, having fueled an exponential increase in research trials in the 20 years since it began.
One does not need a PhD in cognitive psychology to recognize that overloading doctors working in a high-stress, time-constrained environment with a mass of guidelines and research results will lead to errors.
And the attempted solution – hard-wiring the guidelines into computerized “decision support tools” – has been largely a flop, given computer models’ inability to accommodate messy, real-world clinical practice.
For example, generations of medical students have memorized the textbook features of celiac disease for their examinations.
But your Aunt Nora’s celiac disease has not read the textbook.
Indeed, only Aunt Nora can tell you how her celiac disease behaves.
She also happens to be opposed to taking blue-colored pills.
And she insists that, years ago, when she took drug x, it made her feel like a new woman – despite the fact that, in 1,000 patients, drug x has demonstrated, on average, no effect.
The computer model’s treatment recommendations would probably not work for Aunt Nora.
But this does not mean that evidence-based medicine is broken; it simply lacks the needed maturity.
High-quality randomized trials are as important now as they were at the time of the evidence-based movement’s founding.
But the system must be shaped by the doctor’s judgment and the patient’s individual experience.
It is time to stop overloading doctors with evidence and deploying fast-talking industry salespeople to manipulate them with clever marketing pitches.
Instead, researchers must optimize the presentation, summarization, processing, and application of epidemiological evidence, using good visualization techniques that improve doctors’ understanding of complex statistics.
At the same time, research-derived facts about the average patient must not outweigh individual patients’ observations of their own bodies and illnesses.
New processes for capturing and accommodating patients’ personal experiences – which are typically idiosyncratic, subjective, and impossible to standardize – would go a long way toward ensuring that each patient receives the right treatment.
The medical community must develop the science of shared decision-making, in which epidemiological evidence informs conversations about what matters to the patient and how best to achieve those goals.
In doing so, we can take evidence-based medicine beyond its current limits and develop a holistic approach that accounts for patients’ experience of illness and promotes good clinical practice.
Is the TPP Good for America?
WASHINGTON, DC – The Trans-Pacific Partnership, the far-reaching trade and investment agreement that the United States has negotiated with 11 other countries, including Canada, Mexico, Japan, Malaysia, Australia, and Vietnam, is now up for debate.
In order to enter into effect, the US Congress must approve the TPP, which is not likely until enough members make up their minds about the merits of the case.
So, what does the TPP mean for US voters now and in the future?
For starters, while the TPP would most likely generate some overall gain for the US economy, measured in terms of GDP and people’s incomes, that gain is very small and comes mostly from providing greater opportunities for US exports – by reducing tariff and non-tariff barriers in other countries.
Some imports would become cheaper as well, benefiting American consumers.
In analytical work favored by President Barack Obama’s administration, the projections suggest that approval of the TPP could cause the total size of the US economy to be 0.5% higher in 2030 than it would be otherwise.
Note that this estimate is of the TPP’s effect on the level of aggregate income after 15 years, not of its impact on the annual growth rate.
Given that this assessment is advanced by TPP supporters, it seems reasonable to suppose that it represents the higher end of what they regard as plausible.
(I am a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, under whose auspices the study was published, but I had no part in its preparation.)
Unfortunately, the models used in this field do not generate error bands or confidence intervals.
In fact, given the complexity of the trade agreement – including the emphasis on hard-to-quantify non-tariff barriers – these estimates are likely to be highly imprecise.
Second, such models ignore key issues that belong in any quantitative analysis.
For example, when imports surge, there are significant negative effects on employment.
Compelling evidence on this point comes from outstanding research by Daron Acemoglu, David Autor, David Dorn, Gordon Hanson, and Brendan Price, who found that “total job losses from rising Chinese import competition over 1999-2011” were in the range of 2-2.4 million.
People who lose high-paying jobs in manufacturing can find alternative work – but typically at a much lower wage in a low-productivity part of the service sector.
In principle, they could be compensated for this loss of lifetime income; but such compensation is very limited in the US.
In reality, there are long-lasting or even permanent effects on some communities – and particularly on people with less education in places where prosperity was based on manufacturing that is now exposed to more competition from imports.
In addition, the pro-TPP model assumes that wages rise with productivity.
This used to be the case in the US; but the relationship has been greatly weakened in recent decades – precisely as globalization has deepened.
As a result, the model’s estimates regarding how unskilled workers will benefit from the TPP thus seem like a stretch.
Third, basing any policy decision on models alone is fraught with danger.
The TPP will change many other dimensions of public policy, including the protections afforded to foreign investors (making it easier for them to sue governments) and access to affordable medicines (for low-income countries but also potentially for Americans).
And it is striking that the TPP currently does essentially nothing to discourage currency manipulation – sustained one-way intervention in the foreign-exchange market, aimed at devaluing a currency and gaining a competitive advantage.
In the 1980s, imports of goods and services into the US were about 10% of GDP; now that figure is about 17%, and the TPP would presumably push it higher (so the models say).
But as the US trades more with the world, it becomes more vulnerable to job loss caused by currency manipulation.
Based on available evidence, it seems fair to conclude the following about the TPP: It would result in a very small increase in total GDP; it would increase at least some measures of inequality; and it would increase the number of jobs at risk, without providing a commensurate safeguard against currency manipulation.
The International Trade Commission is conducting an in-depth assessment of the TPP, which should be ready in a few months.
One hopes that the ITC will provide a more complete and granular analysis – including of potential downsides for various sectors – than is currently available.
An objective assessment will find that the TPP is no “slam dunk” that should be approved automatically.
Much greater scrutiny and discussion of the agreement’s details is warranted.
The good news is that this process of careful assessment is now underway.
The Electoral Fate of Italy’s Banks
LONDON – As Italy approaches what promises to be one of its most contentious general elections since 1945, banks are the elephant in the room.
Too big and cumbersome to be ignored, they are a constant source of embarrassment for the parties that have been in government since the global financial crisis of 2008, especially for former Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, who hopes to rekindle his political career in March.
They are also an inviting anti-establishment target for the populists of the Five Star Movement.
Indeed, Italy’s banks epitomize all the problems that the financial crisis brought to the country, and on which the populists are capitalizing: a double-dip recession followed by sluggish GDP growth, high unemployment, especially among the young, and a collapse of domestic demand.
Banks also embody the tangle of vested interests, malpractice, and even corruption that, together with la dolce vita, have come to be associated with Italy.
Despite the bail-in of four local banks, the bailout of Monte dei Paschi (one of Italy’s systemically important banks), the liquidation of two regional banks, and the market-led rescue of the mid-size banking group Carige – all within two years – the banking system has yet to be stabilized.
Will the underlying economic recovery – this year and next, the Italian economy should grow in real terms by 1% – assist Italy’s banking sector by keeping a lid on a stock of non-performing loans (NPLs) totaling nearly €180 billion ($220.9 billion)?
Or should the recovery be used to clean up wobbly banks’ balance sheets, by bundling their NPLs and selling them at a discount?
Before the global financial crisis, Italy was described as a country of solid banks that were rooted in the local economy and never played with exotic financial instruments such as derivatives.
It was also said to be a country of prudent savers, who buttressed the profligate public sector and its expanding debt.
In the aftermath of the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008, Italy’s then-finance minister Giulio Tremonti famously endorsed the health of the country’s banking system.
As a result, a major recapitalization of Italian banks and the creation of a “bad bank” to absorb NPLs were deemed unnecessary.
Ten years later, Italy is no longer that imagined land of prosperous banks and happy savers.
The prolonged recession and economic malaise have dented the individual savings rate, while banks no longer have the resources to provide peace of mind to many retail investors, whose trust has been severely eroded.
The implicit pact between banks and savers was broken in late 2015, when four troubled local banks were bailed in and the shareholders took the hit.
For years, this pact had underpinned Italian-style financial repression, whereby risk-adverse savers traded safety, implicitly assuming that banks could not fail, and accepted relatively low real returns.
The political backlash that ensued from the bail-in triggered a blame game between the government and the opposition parties, and even between politicians and regulators, with all blaming the European Union and its banking regulations.
The government that emerges on March 4 will have to make the banking sector a high priority.
In order to restore confidence among savers and investors, it will have to find a solution to clear banks’ balance sheets of NPLs, which are undermining credit, making capital more expensive, and thus acting as a drag on the economy.
The solution must be market-led, as the volume of NPLs is far too big, and the recovery far too slow, for this debt to be gradually absorbed.
The new government thus may need to identify cases where NPLs hinder banks’ normal functioning, sell this debt, and prop up the capital of the affected banks.
At the same time, civil bankruptcy procedures will need to be reformed, to ensure the reasonably fast action on defaulted borrowers’ assets.
If confidence and credibility are to be restored, sound governance has to be put at the core of the next government’s plans for banks.
Over the years, regulatory lapses, lack of board independence, and a good dose of financial repression turned many banks into channels to fund family members, friends, and political associates.
Monte dei Paschi, for example, was long associated with the center-left Democratic Party, which has been in government since 2013.
This political association may have prolonged the bank’s saga for several years, until it had become so battered by inconsistent piecemeal interventions that a market solution became impossible.
Following last year’s bailout, Italy’s Treasury owns about 70% of the bank.
Restoring market credibility also means clarifying banks’ role in the economy.
If they provide a public good – that is, credit to the real economy – should they be part of a broad-based long-term economic policy strategy for the country?
And, in an economy with approximately 600 small independent banks and too many branches, should consolidation be encouraged and supported?
Any effort to put Italy’s banking sector on a sounder footing will require a stable majority government, consistent determination to put economic growth at the center of the political agenda, and willingness to confront Italy’s many vested interests.
Unfortunately, none of the parties has so far come out with a comprehensive, credible economic agenda.
And none so far seems capable of winning or delivering a parliamentary majority.
The most likely scenario, then, is that Italy’s zombified banks will continue to feed the populist electoral narrative.
And if that narrative fuels a populist victory in March, reform of the banking sector will again be postponed, raising the eventual cost still further.
The Bunga-Bunga Party Returns to Italy
LONDON – Now that Italy’s next general election has been set for March 4, the main contestants are limbering up for a tough eight-week campaign.
The outcome is expected to be messy and inconclusive, but one thing already seems clear: the pacesetter may not be the 31- or 42-year-old sprinters heading the two leading parties, but rather an 81-year-old marathon runner.
Yes, as shocking as it is, the kingmaker in this election could be none other than Silvio Berlusconi, the three-time prime minister who popularized the term “bunga-bunga party.”
Berlusconi, who last left office ignominiously in 2011, when the euro sovereign-debt crisis threatened to engulf Italy, cannot yet aspire to a fourth term – or to any public office – owing to a tax-fraud conviction in 2013, yet the center-right coalition he leads has the most momentum going into the election.
Italy’s last general election, in February 2013, was also messy and inconclusive.
Since then, the country has been governed by coalitions led by the center-left Democratic Party (PD).
And now, heading into the campaign, Italy is experiencing its fastest economic growth in more than a decade, though unemployment remains stubbornly high, at more than 11% (and roughly 35% for younger workers).
Yet that isn’t helping the PD.
While serving as prime minister from February 2014 to December 2016, Matteo Renzi, the PD’s youthful and charismatic leader, cast himself as a rottamatore (scrapper) who would dismantle the old ways of the political establishment.
But he ended up alienating more people than he impressed.
His signature achievement was legislation to reform Italy’s sclerotic labor markets – hardly a vote-winner.
Since peaking in 2015, with 40% of the vote in European Parliament polls, support for the PD has slipped to only 20-25%, and the party’s left wing has split off.
Today, the leading single party in opinion polls is the insurgent, populist Five Star Movement (M5S), led by the comedian Beppe Grillo (though its official prime ministerial candidate is an inexperienced 31-year-old, Luigi Di Maio).
M5S has matured since its founding five years ago, when its central message boiled down to “a plague on all your houses.”
It has since moderated its opposition to the euro.
And with support at around 26-29%, it remains popular despite its poor performance running the city council of Rome.
The problem for M5S is that, owing to a new electoral law, it will have to win roughly 40% of the total vote to secure a parliamentary majority.
Whereas proportional representation will determine two-thirds of seats in the lower house, one-third will be decided by first-past-the-post voting in single-member constituencies, where the M5S will likely lose out, because it is neither willing nor able to form the electoral alliances needed to secure majorities.
In fact, the party grouping that will benefit the most from the current electoral system will be the only one that has managed to forge a pre-election pact with other parties: the Berlusconi-led center right.
As he demonstrated with his election victories in 1994, 2001, and 2008, Berlusconi’s greatest strength has always been building coalitions.
And, as in those elections, his own party, Forza Italia, will have as its main partner the separatist, anti-immigrant, and Euroskeptic Northern League.
Of course, it will not be all smooth sailing for Berlusconi.
He will have to navigate the tricky process of agreeing to joint candidates with the Northern League’s energetic and ambitious leader, Matteo Salvini – who has his own eye on the center-right leadership – and with the group’s third, smaller partner: the right-wing Brothers of Italy.
Still, things are looking good for Berlusconi so far.
Forza Italia is polling at around 16%, which is slightly higher than the Northern League’s support, even if it is well below the party’s heyday, when it polled above 25%.
And the center right will likely benefit from voter anger over inflows of refugees and migrants, and from the public’s fear of M5S’s disruptive potential.
The wind is at their backs.
For his part, Berlusconi has cast himself as an elder statesman – even a safe pair of hands.
He has softened his image, by speaking up for pensioners and professing a new interest in animal rights.
And, last but not least, he is still a stellar campaigner who happens to own the country’s major commercial TV stations.
Securing an absolute majority would be a tall order for Berlusconi’s group; but it is not impossible.
At any rate, a strong showing would be quite a comeback for the old showman – which is precisely what he has always relished.
If his center-right coalition wins a majority, he will directly choose the prime minister; more likely, he will be the key player in negotiations over a grand coalition government of center-right and center-left parties.
Most remarkable of all, either scenario would be widely regarded as a stable and respectable outcome, compared to the most likely alternative: a minority government led by M5S.
Could Berlusconi end up being Italy’s political savior?
Don’t rule it out.
Japan’s Demographic Lessons for Europe
BRUSSELS – Demography is not destiny, at least not entirely.
Over centuries, policy can affect fertility decisions, and migration can transform a country, as the experience of the United States shows.
Over shorter time horizons, however, demographic trends must be taken as given, and can have a profound impact on growth.
Yet demographic factors are often neglected in economic reporting, leading to significant distortions in assessments of countries’ performance.
Nowhere is this more apparent than in Japan.
With real output – the key measure of economic performance – having risen by only about 15% since 2000, or less than 1% per year, Japan easily seems the least dynamic of the worlds’ major economies.
But given Japan’s demographics – the country’s working-age population has been shrinking by almost 1% per year since the start of this century – this result is remarkable.
In fact, Japan’s growth rate per working-age person was close to 2% – much higher than in the US or in Europe.
Though the US economy grew more than 35% since 2000, its working-age population also grew markedly, leaving the annual growth rate per working-age person at only about 1%.
That indicator – growth rate per working-age person – is not widely used by economists, who instead focus on GDP per capita.
By that measure, Japan is doing about as well as Europe and the US.
But, while per capita indicators are useful for assessing a country’s consumption potential, they do not provide an adequate picture of growth potential, because they include the elderly and the young, who do not contribute to production.
Even in Japan, with its high life expectancy, those over the age of 70 do not contribute much to output.
So, given its rapidly declining potential, Japan has been extraordinarily successful.
A key reason is that it has put a growing proportion of its working-age population to work: unemployment is today at a record low of less than 3%, and almost 80% of those who could work have a job, compared to about 70% for Europe and the US.
Japan’s achievement of full employment and high job growth over the last two decades is all the more noteworthy in view of near-permanent deflation during this period (most prices are still lower today than they were 15-20 years ago). This should give food for thought to those who maintain that deflation imposes unbearable economic costs.
The Japanese experience holds important lessons for Europe, where the demographic future looks a lot like Japan’s past.
The eurozone’s working-age population has not grown at all in recent years, and will soon start to decline at a rate similar to Japan’s over the last generation.
It seems unlikely that immigration will alter the trend. In recent years, Europeans, like Japanese, have proven to be highly resistant to large-scale immigration, which is what would be required to offset demographic decline.
Moreover, the eurozone has now settled on a current-account surplus of around 3% of GDP.
That is similar to the level long seen in Japan (except for the short period in the aftermath of the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi nuclear meltdown).
A first lesson of Japan’s experience is that, despite the eurozone’s difficulty generating inflation in an aging society characterized by excess savings, growth is not necessarily out of reach.
Rather, given Japan’s record of growth without inflation, the European Central Bank should recognize that its target of “close to 2%” inflation might not be so important after all.
In any case, the particularities of the eurozone’s structure mean that the ECB will have no choice but to halt its bond-buying operations in a year or so.
This means that the ECB will not be able to follow in the footsteps of the Bank of Japan, which continues to purchase large volumes of government bonds, without any visible pick-up in inflation.
Another lesson from Japan is that a country with a large savings surplus can handle a large public debt, because it can be financed internally. That does not necessarily mean that it is desirable to run up the debt.
Japan’s debt-to-GDP ratio now exceeds 150% of GDP (taking into account the large financial assets of the government-owned savings institutions), and continues to rise, owing to large fiscal deficits.
This brings us to a final key lesson from Japan: in a low-growth economy, the debt-to-GDP ratio can quickly spin of out control.
Fortunately, it seems that this lesson already has been learned, with the average deficit in the eurozone now amounting to only around 2% of GDP.
The deficit cap imposed by the Stability and Growth Pact (3% of GDP) seems to have had at least some impact in terms of stabilizing the debt ratio.
The structure of the eurozone imposes limits on the use of both fiscal and monetary policy.
This should prevent the excessive build-up of debt, ultimately making it easier for the eurozone to manage a future in which the only way to sustain growth is to capitalize fully on the economy’s declining demographic potential.
Why Is Japan Populist-Free?
TOKYO – Even as a wave of right-wing populism is sweeping Europe, the United States, India, and parts of Southeast Asia, Japan has so far appeared to be immune.
There are no Japanese demagogues, like Geert Wilders, Marine Le Pen, Donald Trump, Narendra Modi, or Rodrigo Duterte, who have exploited pent-up resentments against cultural or political elites.
Why?
Perhaps the closest Japan has come was the former mayor of Osaka, Toru Hashimoto, who first made his name as a television personality and then disgraced himself in recent years by commending the use of wartime sex slaves by the Imperial Japanese Army.
His ultra-nationalist views and loathing of liberal media were a familiar version of right-wing populism.
But he never managed to break into national politics.
Hashimoto now gives Prime Minister Shinzo Abe free advice on tightening national-security laws.
And therein lies one explanation for the apparent lack of right-wing populism in Japan.
No one could be more identified with the political elite than Abe, the grandson of a wartime cabinet minister and later prime minister, and son of a foreign minister.
And yet, he shares right-wing populists’ hostility to liberal academics, journalists, and intellectuals.
Postwar Japanese democracy was influenced in the 1950 and 1960s by an intellectual elite that consciously sought to distance Japan from its wartime nationalism.
Abe and his allies are trying to quash that influence.
His efforts to revise Japan’s pacifist constitution, restore pride in its wartime record, and discredit “elitist” mainstream media, such as the left-of-center newspaper Asahi Shimbun, have earned him the praise of Donald Trump’s former strategist, Stephen Bannon, who called Abe a “Trump before Trump.”
In some ways, Bannon was right to think so.
In November 2016, Abe told Trump: “I’ve been successful in taming the Asahi Shimbun.
I hope you will likewise be successful in taming The New York Times.”
Even as a joke between two supposedly democratic leaders, this was disgraceful.
So one might say that elements of right-wing populism are at the heart of the Japanese government, embodied by a scion of one of the country’s most elite families.
This paradox, however, is not the only explanation for the absence of a Japanese Le Pen, Modi, or Wilders.
For demagogues to be able to stir up popular resentments against foreigners, cosmopolitans, intellectuals, and liberals, there must be wide and obvious financial, cultural, and educational disparities.
This was the case in Japan in the mid-1930s, when military hotheads staged a failed coup aimed at bankers, businessmen, and politicians who in their view were corrupting the Japanese polity.
The coup was supported by soldiers who had often grown up in poor rural areas.
Their sisters sometimes had to be sold to big city brothels for their families to survive.
The Westernized cosmopolitan urban elites were the enemy.
And public opinion was largely on the side of the rebels.
Contemporary Japan may have its flaws, but it is now much more egalitarian than the US, India, or many countries in Europe.
High taxes make it hard to pass on inherited wealth.
And, unlike in the US, where material prosperity is flaunted, not least by Trump himself, the most affluent Japanese tend to be discreet.
Japan has surpassed the US as a country of the middle class.
Resentment feeds off a sense of humiliation, a loss of pride.
In a society where human worth is measured by individual success, symbolized by celebrity and money, it is easy to feel humiliated by a relative lack of it, of being just another face in the crowd.
In extreme cases, desperate individuals will assassinate a president or a rock star just to get into the news.
Populists find support among those resentful faces in the crowd, people who feel that elites have betrayed them, by taking away their sense of pride in their class, their culture, or their race.
This has not happened in Japan yet.
Culture may have something to do with it.
Self-promotion, in the American style, is frowned upon.
To be sure, Japan has a celebrity culture, driven by mass media.
But self-worth is defined less by individual fame or wealth than by having a place in a collective enterprise, and doing the job one is assigned as well as one can.
People in department stores seem to take genuine pride in wrapping merchandise beautifully.
Some jobs – think of those uniformed middle-aged men who smile and bow at customers entering a bank – appear to be entirely superfluous.
It would be naive to assume that these tasks give huge satisfaction, but they offer people a sense of place, a role in society, however humble.
Meanwhile, the domestic Japanese economy remains one of the most protected and least globalized in the developed world.
There are several reasons why Japanese governments have resisted the neoliberalism promoted in the West since the Reagan/Thatcher years: corporate interests, bureaucratic privileges, and pork-barrel politics of various kinds.
But preserving pride in employment, at the cost of efficiency, is one of them.
If this stifles individual enterprise, then so be it.
Thatcherism has probably made the British economy more efficient.
But by crushing trade unions and other established institutions of working-class culture, governments have also taken away sources of pride for people who often do unpleasant jobs.
Efficiency does not create a sense of community.
Those who now feel adrift blame their predicament on elites who are better educated and sometimes more talented – and thus better able to thrive in a global economy.
One of the more ironic consequences is that many such people in the US have chosen as their president a narcissistic billionaire who brags about his wealth, personal success, and genius.
Nothing like that is likely to happen in Japan.
We might learn something valuable from reflecting on the reasons why.
The Conscience of a Conservative?
CAMBRIDGE – In a recent speech that received much attention in the United States and abroad, US Senator Jeff Flake, a Republican from Arizona, announced that he would not seek reelection.
To agree with the reasoning Flake offered in defense of his decision, one must believe that a US senator’s highest duty is to speak truth to power, repudiate the president for “reckless, outrageous, and undignified behavior” that is “undermining our democracy,” and then quit.
Many mainstream media outlets apparently believe just that, lavishing praise on Flake’s impassioned jeremiad.
According to a CNN political analyst, it was “the most important political speech of 2017 – and one of the most powerful political speeches in the modern era of the Senate.”
Both The New York Times and The Washington Post featured the speech prominently in front-page stories.
But if we take Flake at his word that he is acting on principle, we must ask: what principle?
If Flake is right that democracy itself is in peril unless we all “stand up and speak out,” then what good does it do to throw in the towel?
In his speech, Flake began by pointing out that President Donald Trump’s words and actions are consistently beyond the pale, bringing disgrace to the office of the presidency.
But Trump’s coarse behavior isn’t news to anyone who has been paying attention.
Flake then announced that he would “no longer be complicit or silent.”
We can certainly applaud him for that, but then we should ask what took him so long.
All Americans have a right – indeed, a duty – to speak out against threats to their country.
But a senator is more than just another citizen.
Flake is one of 100 members of America’s highest legislative body.
He shares with his fellow senators the power to vote yes or no on proposals made by the president.
He can draft and help shape legislation that he believes to be in the public interest.
And if at some point the US House of Representatives brings impeachment charges against Trump, he would be one of 100 judges presiding over that fateful case.
It is understandable that a senator who regards a sitting president as a serious threat to the Republic would sound the alarm.
But for that senator simultaneously to announce that he is quitting makes no sense at all, especially given a senator’s unique power to act as well as to talk.
Flake’s dire warning suggests that he should stay, not run away.
Of course, Flake’s unstated reason for choosing flight over fight is hiding in plain view.
Polls showed that he would have had a tough time getting reelected in 2018.
Having been targeted first by Trump, and then by former White House Chief Strategist and current Breitbart News Executive Chairman Steve Bannon, Flake might not even have defeated a Republican primary challenger.
Granted, no one is obliged to submit himself to the slings and arrows of electoral politics.
And no one can be blamed for not wanting to participate in the poisonous politics of Washington today.
As a citizen, I thank Flake for his service in Congress.
But if he wants us to believe that his speech and decision to resign are in the service of the country, and based on principle, then he needs to explain what that principle is.
According to Immanuel Kant’s categorical imperative, principled action is that action which, if emulated by all others, would create a world in which we all want to live.
Does Flake want to live in a world in which all lawmakers who disagree with Trump have already stood up, spoken out vigorously, and left office?
It isn’t clear whether Flake is calling for a boycott of electoral politics, or merely warning others not to run in races they might not win.
Either way, somebody will replace Flake in the Senate.
So, it is worth asking if he thinks his successor will be better suited than he is to carry out the critically important duties of public service.
In his 2017 book, Conscience of a Conservative, Flake boldly asserts that “we have become so estranged from our principles that we no longer know what principle is.”
Should this now be read as an unwitting confession that he has lost his own moral bearings?
In his speech, Flake cited the Republican president Theodore Roosevelt as the model of “conscience and principle” to which he aspires.
But those who have read Roosevelt know that he would not have walked away from today’s fight.
“It is not the critic who counts,” Roosevelt said in the speech “Citizenship in a Republic,” which he delivered at the Sorbonne in Paris in April 1910.
“The credit belongs to the man in the arena,” Roosevelt continued, “who spends himself in a worthy cause, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.”
Now, that is a principle upon which the United States, and any republic, should stand.
Donald Trump’s Federal Reserve
CAMBRIDGE – With the appointment of Jerome Powell as the next Chair of the United States Federal Reserve Board, Donald Trump has made perhaps the most important single decision of his presidency.
It is a sane and sober choice that heralds short-term continuity in Fed interest-rate policy, and perhaps a simpler and cleaner approach to regulatory policy.
Although Powell is not a PhD economist like current Fed Chair Janet Yellen and her predecessor, Ben Bernanke, he has used his years as an “ordinary” governor at the Fed to gain a deep knowledge of the key issues he will face.
But make no mistake: the institution Powell will now head rules the global financial system.
All other central bankers, finance ministers, and even presidents run a distant second.
If that seems hyperbolic, it is only because most of us don’t really pay attention to the Fed on a day-to-day basis.
When the Fed gets it right, price stability reigns, unemployment remains low, and output hums along.
But “getting it right” is not always easy, and when the Fed gets it wrong, the results can be pretty ugly.
Famously, the Fed’s efforts to tame a stock-market bubble in the late 1920s sparked the Great Depression of the 1930s.
(Fortunately, of the candidates Trump was considering for the Fed post, Powell is the one least likely to repeat this mistake.)
And when the Fed printed mountains of money in the 1970s to try to dull the pain of that decade’s oil shocks, it triggered an inflationary surge that took more than a decade to tame.
At times, the rest of the world seems to care more about Fed policy than Americans do.
Little wonder: perhaps more than ever, the US dollar lies at the heart of the global financial system.
This is partly because much of world trade and finance is indexed to the dollar, leading many countries to try to mimic Fed policies to stabilize their exchange rates.
Powell will face some extraordinary challenges at the outset of his five-year term.
By some measures, stock markets look even frothier today than they did in the 1920s.
With today’s extraordinarily low interest rates, investors seem ever more willing to assume greater risk in search of return.
At the same time, despite a strongly growing US and global economy, inflation remains mystifyingly low.
This has made it extremely difficult for the Fed to normalize policy interest rates (still only 1%) so that it has room to cut them when the next recession hits, which it inevitably will.
(The odds of a recession hitting in any given year are around 17%, and that seems like a good guess now.)
If Powell and the Fed cannot normalize interest rates before the next recession, what will they do?
Yellen insists that there is nothing to worry about; the Fed has everything under control, because it can turn to alternative instruments.
But many economists have come to believe that much of this is smoke and mirrors.
For example, so-called quantitative easing involves having the Fed issue short-term debt to buy up long-term government debt.
But the US Treasury owns the Fed, and can carry out such debt purchases perfectly well by itself.
Some argue for “helicopter money,” whereby the Fed prints money and hands it out.
But this, too, is smoke and mirrors.
The Fed has neither the legal authority nor the political mandate to run fiscal policy; if it tries to do so, it runs the risk of forever losing its independence.
Given that monetary policy is the first and best line of defense against a recession, an urgent task for the new chair is to develop a better approach.
Fortunately, good ideas exist, and one can only hope that Powell will quickly move to create a committee to study long-term fixes.
One idea is to raise the Fed’s inflation target.
But this would be problematic, not least because it would breach a decades-long promise to keep inflation around 2%.
Moreover, higher inflation would induce greater indexation, ultimately undermining the effectiveness of monetary policy.
Paving the way for effective negative-interest-rate policy is a more radical – but by far the more elegant – solution.
Bank regulation is also part of the Fed’s mandate.
The 2010 Dodd-Frank financial-reform legislation, which has spawned 30,000 pages of rules, has been a boon for lawyers.
But the massive compliance costs ultimately fall on small and medium-size businesses.
It would be far better simply to require banks to raise much more of their resources in equity markets instead of through bonds.
That way, shareholders, not taxpayers, would take the big hit in a crisis.
I have not mentioned the elephant in the room: the threat to the Fed’s independence posed by a president seemingly intent on challenging all institutional norms.
When President Richard Nixon was intent on being re-elected in 1972, he put heavy pressure on then-Fed Chair Arthur Burns to “juice” the economy.
Nixon was re-elected, but inflation soared and growth collapsed.
No one should be wishing for a replay – even if Nixon eventually was impeached.
Goodbye, Johnny
PARIS – What better send-off for a rocker than Saturday’s vast, silent concert on the steps of a church?
And what better farewell to a great performer than the one delivered by the immense crowd chanting around a body that seemed to have arranged, from the great beyond, this last demonstration of enthusiasm and love?
Herein lies the beguiling feature of the funeral of Johnny Hallyday, France’s national singer: his ability to stage-manage his destiny, right up the final hour, and the star power that his being retained even in death.
The costume he chose for his last performance was oblong and white.
Nothing remained of his swaying hips and his howls, or of the pale eyes perpetually on the verge of laughing or crying (you never knew which).
And yet there he was, charisma and presence, the spell of a shaman inviting you one last time to dance the eternal chorus in the aura of his mystery and his smile.
And there was the spirit of France: young and old, the French president and two of his predecessors, the novelists Philippe Labro and Daniel Rondeau, celebrities, artists, fans from 50 years ago wearing Apache fringe, a remembrance of the striking miners of Lorraine, the words of Jacques Prévert, tears shed by ordinary people.
And all of them seemed to be under Hallyday’s influence still: The great actor who was suddenly starkly human and at a loss.
The old, unsentimental crooner with a tear on his cheek.
The column of bikers that descended the Champs-Elysées, which never wore its funereal name so well.
There was the Place de la Madeleine, too.
Usually so staid and cold, it echoed to the rhythm of strings with the swing of the Louisiana bayous at one moment, and at the next with the memory of the concert at the Olympia, so close but a half-century away, where the saturnine firebrand upended ten thousand hearts.
Here was an upwelling of emotion the likes of which France had not seen since the funerals of Victor Hugo and Edith Piaf, since the catafalque of Jean Jaurès went up the Rue Soufflot.
A million mourners were left not knowing whether to cry, sing, throw chairs around, request an encore, or light candles.
Disappearing in a final parade of passion and energy, of restlessness and quiet rebellion, of inner fissures and desire for harmony, was someone who had spent his life trying not to survive.
And on that day, he was so well mourned that his absence seemed like part of a show, somehow making us forget that he was no longer with us.
Abiding in each of us was the Johnny that moved us all: the youth spent with a traveling act, like Gautier’s Captain Fracasse; the father, a character out of Modiano, who, between bouts of drinking, pawned the gifts given to him by his abandoned son.
And then there was the ’60s rocker with the eyes of a sad wolf and cheekbones hewn by Giacometti, the Catcher in the Rye mood, and a melancholy so intensely hopeless that it seemed to condemn him to live on the edge of every form of excess.
He was the consummate artist of the French scene, a chameleon beamed out on satellite TV, dripping with fake sweat and real glitz, an artist who, like a novelist, confessed as a way of lying.
Hallyday was the child of a generation that watched American GIs enter Paris and that invented for itself an American ascendance.
America was cigarettes, Levi’s, and Coca-Cola.
But it was also the languor of the blues, Nashville, and the green light that he saw gleaming at dawn after nights soaked in alcohol and amphetamines.
When this distraught colossus of sorrow, the unsleeping and suicidal cowboy, offered his body in sacrifice to the camera and to the mob of entranced fans, he struck François Mauriac as a Mephistophelean figure.
Here was the hero, motley and scarred, whose glory seemed like a wound, whose victories were stigmata, and who, from metamorphosis to metamorphosis, embodied what is wrongly called pop or variety but that was, in him, more like fallen greatness or the lament of a cleverly disguised poet.
And, at the end, there was King Lear triumphant, the wax face with the periwinkle gaze, survivor of an era whose heroes perished before the age of 30, one who knew that his survival was a miracle.
And then, finally, there were those near-deaths in the manner of Bossuet (“Johnny is dying!
Johnny is dead!”): he would always revive, right up to the very last time, when he lived again in Paris for a few hours under a cold December sun.
The Vatican of literature that is the Swedish Academy has, with the Nobel coronation of Bob Dylan, rescued song from its canonical hell.
In the case of Johnny Hallyday, it is perhaps not too farfetched to believe that this man of sphinx-like mystery is now, like Baudelaire, “a block of granite surrounded by vague fear” whose “fierce nature sings only to the rays of the setting sun.”
The Hazards Behind the Headlines
LONDON – Not too long ago, the only journalists working in conflict areas who might be afforded protection were those working for wealthy, predominantly Western news organizations.
These journalists would attend expensive courses run by former special forces personnel, who trained them to navigate hostile environments. They would be furnished with flak jackets and helmets, and given first aid kits.
But journalists elsewhere have rarely benefited from this culture of safety.
From Mexico and Brazil to Pakistan and Somalia, journalists are often murdered with impunity.
And more often than not, when the messenger is silenced, so is the message.
For the last 15 years, the International News Safety Institute has been collating a list of journalists who have died on the job. What we have found is shocking: for every ten reporters killed, nine died while on assignment in their home country.
Countless others have had to abandon their homes, jobs, and countries; and those who do stay often live in constant fear for their safety.
In places where corrupt regimes or militant groups want to control the flow of information, journalists have long had to risk being kidnapped or killed.
But in recent years, this threat has become so great that some countries are now effectively no-go zones for international-media organizations.
Western correspondents are aware of these risks when they travel abroad to cover active war zones.
But now they confront similar dangers at home.
Wherever journalists work – whether online or offline – they need to be mindful of more physical, psychological, and digital risks than ever before.
Terrorist attacks have affected news organizations, particularly in Europe, in unexpected ways.
Many of those who arrived first at the scene of the Manchester Arena bombing or the massacre at the Bataclan concert hall in Paris had not received the physical training for such eventualities, nor were they emotionally prepared to cover stories where they would be exposed to that degree of trauma.
In response to these events, some newsrooms have started preparing for what they will do if a domestic terrorist attack directly affects their operations.
Organizations – including the BBC, the Dutch public service broadcaster NOS, and others across Europe – have plans in place for journalists responding to incidents in their home cities or those directly targeting their newsrooms.
Beyond bullets and bombs, journalists also face increasing psychological threats at home.
In July, a report I co-authored for the International News Safety Institute put a name to one such threat, a phenomenon known as “moral injury.”
The report, published by the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism at the University of Oxford, examined the impact of covering the recent refugee crisis in Europe on members of the media.
Reporting on a traumatic story, we found, can have a profound impact on one’s mental health.
Our research noted that feelings of guilt and helplessness can be overwhelming when events “transgress personal moral and ethical values or codes of conduct.”
To guard against the risks of moral injury, we highlighted the importance of education, explaining that, “journalists need to understand that this is the ‘new’ terrain, part of the mental landscape of the profession.”
Our report also suggested that organizations should look to provide support to those who needed it, bearing in mind that individuals respond to and recover from trauma in different ways.
In the US, journalists face another kind of psychological threat: harassment from their own government.
Although journalists are protected by the First Amendment of the US Constitution, US President Donald Trump has nevertheless used his social-media bully pulpit to routinely vilify the entire news media.
Trump’s disdain for free speech mirrors that of authoritarian governments, from Turkey to the Philippines, where journalists have been arrested, imprisoned, and harassed in record numbers.
Journalists are also increasingly vulnerable online, where anonymity has created a culture of trolling and harassment.
Female journalists have had to bear the brunt of digital attacks, which can rapidly escalate into threats of sexual violence.
In response, many journalists have abandoned social media, and others have left the profession of journalism altogether.
The world is a risky place for journalists, which is precisely why we must do everything that we can to protect them.
Never before has the role of journalism been so important.
In today’s noisy, confusing, multi-channel news landscape, where “fake news” is sold as fact, we need accountable, analytical, responsible reporting more than ever.
A free press delivers truth, holds power to account, and calls out threats to liberty and justice.
But the press can never be free if its members are not kept safe.
Jean-Claude Juncker’s Roadmap for European Disaster
MUNICH – A group of hikers has lost its way.
They want to get to a castle on a hill in the distance, but the path they are on seems to be leading in a different direction, and their leader’s only advice is to hurry up.
Today, the eurozone is in the same situation as those hikers.
It has become increasingly clear that establishing the euro was the wrong path to take.
The single currency caused an inflationary credit bubble in Southern Europe.
When the bubble burst, the region’s competitiveness was destroyed, and Northern Europe was called on to provide huge loan guarantees, public credit, and transfers.
These measures have sustained the wrong relative prices that resulted from the bubble, and papered over the underlying problem.
Meanwhile, the Schengen Agreement, which eliminated most border checks between European Union member states, has facilitated the ability of immigrants from the poorer parts of Asia and Africa to flock to Northern European welfare states in recent years.
In response to these events, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker used his State of the Union address this month to call for even more countries to join the eurozone and the Schengen Area.
Juncker is the charismatic but confused guide who is leading our metaphorical group of hikers astray.
All non-euro EU member states, except Denmark are already legally obligated to work toward adopting the euro, by satisfying various “convergence criteria.”
But Juncker obviously wants to accelerate that process, by loosening the eurozone membership criteria and providing financial incentives for new members to join.
Given the eurozone’s past problems, this is an extremely dangerous proposition.
If realized, it would probably fuel the same kind of destructive overheating that we have seen in Southern Europe.
In fact, Bulgarian, Croatian, and Romanian households have already loaded up on excessive debt in foreign currencies – primarily euros – in anticipation of joining the monetary union, and this has created substantial financial difficulties.
Of course, it is understandable that Western banks that recklessly extended euro loans to these countries now want to give them euro printing presses.
That way, the debtor countries can reassure their creditors and repay their loans with self-printed cash if necessary, as Southern European countries have done for the last decade.
Providing Bulgaria, Croatia, and Romania with national euro printing presses would keep private credit flowing and enable foreign-currency loans to be rolled over.
But so much artificially cheap credit would also bloat state pensions, government wages, and social transfers.
And this, in turn, would lead to overheating real-estate markets and domestic-wage increases, thus undermining international competitiveness.
Normally, a country that finds itself in such a position would urgently devalue its currency.
But, because euro membership precludes that option, financially sound Northern European countries would once again be called upon to help with European Central Bank loan guarantees and financial transfers, while tolerating the newly added eurozone members’ self-service with the printing press.
In short, Juncker’s plan to accelerate eurozone accession threatens to recreate in spades the chaos of the past decade, which started with a bubble in Southern Europe, and culminated in the Greek sovereign-debt crisis.
Juncker’s proposal to extend the Schengen Area to the east is similarly misguided, and seems to ignore the lessons of recent history.
The unmanageable wave of immigration in 2015 showed that Europe has too few internal and external border controls.
Juncker might like to think that immigration has since slowed, owing to the agreement that the EU reached with Turkey in early 2016.
But data from the European border-control authority Frontex indicate that the migration flows stalled once a fence was erected in Macedonia, at the behest of Austria and the Visegrád countries (the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia).
Moreover, the Hungarian-Serbian border fence and Hungary’s ever-tightening controls at its border with Romania have also contributed to European stability.
But migrants are now crossing the Black Sea from Turkey to Bulgaria, and might come in even larger numbers if the EU membership negotiations with Turkey stall.
As a result, the rest of the EU should oppose any bid to eliminate existing border controls, which is exactly what would happen if Bulgaria and Romania were included in the Schengen Area.
One can only wonder what is driving Juncker’s proposals.
To be sure, the European Commission cannot neglect the interests of financial institutions in Paris, Luxembourg, and Frankfurt.
No one wants the ill-advised loans extended to Eastern European countries to fuel another bank crisis.
But the result of Juncker having his way would be even worse.
An inflationary bubble in Eastern Europe, coupled with the dismantling of border controls, could destabilize the entire EU and create a fresh wave of economic migrants into Central Europe.
It is time for Europe’s trail guide to see reason, consult a compass, and get back on track.
A Good German Idea for 2018
ATHENS – By 2016, almost all Europeans had realized that radical policy and institutional reforms were essential to revive the European project.
Yet serious reform was impeded by the usual disagreement about what should be done – a dispute that Emmanuel Macron, France’s new president, once described as a “holy war” between German and French elites.
The year just ended, highlighted by the election of a French president much to German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s liking, demonstrated that, ultimately, it does not really matter who rules in Berlin and in Paris, or how much they like each other.
The “holy war” persists, even if the missiles with which each side demolishes the other’s proposals are now wrapped in diplomatic velvet.
At the heart of this Franco-German war is the clash between two Rs: the German commitment to rectitude versus the French penchant for redistribution.
German officials greet every French government proposal by mentally computing its cost for German taxpayers.
And, behind every German counter-proposal, French officials see a ploy to hide behind rules and regulations so that the German elites can have their cake and eat it.
Europe’s continued slide into stagnation and disrepute is the natural outcome.
Perhaps the German insistence on rectitude is right, although not in a sense that German officials will necessarily appreciate.
I could not, in good conscience, side credibly with any French, Italian, or Greek proponent of redistribution if their proposals violated the principles of rectitude.
Doing what is right is, surely, superior to doing what is wrong, but expedient.
But then the question becomes: What is the right thing to do?
And how can we agree on any answer, given our different interests, dispositions, and cultural backgrounds?
One thing is certain: We will never find out what rectitude commands if we are driven solely by our “interests.”
Europe’s impasse is largely due to a standoff between opposing desires, objectives, and concerns: German fears of Greco-Latin rule-bending will always trump French fears of German empire-building, and vice versa.
But if prejudicial desires lead to a dead end, and fail to reveal the right course of action, where does the key to rectitude lie?
“We should all do our duty” – a very German reply – merely displaces the disagreement to another plane, where we interminably debate competing duties.
All madmen in authority, after all, believed they were doing their duty.
So the question becomes: “How can I know what my duty entails?”
A theist answer is equally unacceptable, given the monstrous crimes carried out by zealots convinced they were fulfilling their divine duty.
The best answer I have come across is German: Immanuel Kant’s, to be precise.
For Kant, who struggled to re-define ethics in a new era of market societies, our duty can and must be deduced from our capacity for rationality.
Unlike personal tastes, which are fickle and offer no sure path to happiness or virtue, duties can be discerned by a logical mechanism common to all humans.
To be rational means more than being able to deploy your means efficiently in order to achieve your ends.
All sorts of animals are good at matching available means to given ends.
But humans are unique, Kant insists, because, unlike cats and dogs, we can pass rational judgment on our desires.
We can ask ourselves, “I like X, but should I?”
And we can say, “It is my duty to do Y, even though Y will probably lead to outcomes I dislike, given my expectations of what others will do.”
But if the mark of a rational person is a capacity to act on reasons transcending cost-benefit analysis, how can our rational duty be deduced impartially, free of the influence of personal interests or prejudices?
Kant offers a famous example: Language is what distinguishes us from other species; without it, we are mere beasts.
While lying often pays, if we all lied all the time, language would become obsolete.
Rational humans, Kant concludes, must recognize that they have a duty to abstain from a practice (lying) that, if adopted by everyone at once, would annul our most precious invention (language).
No god is necessary, no moralizing is required, to demonstrate our duty to tell the truth.
Practical reasoning is all it takes: A world where everyone lies is one in which human rationality, which depends entirely on language, dies.
So it is our rational duty to tell the truth, regardless of the benefits lying might bring in practice.
Applied to market societies, Kant’s idea yields fascinating conclusions.
Strategic reductions in price to undercut a competitor pass the test of rational duty (as long as prices do not fall below costs).
After all, producing maximum quantities at minimum prices is the holy grail of any economy.
But strategic reductions of wages to ever lower levels (the Uberization of society) cannot be rational, because the result would be a catastrophic collapse, owing to disappearing aggregate demand.
Turning to Europe, Kant’s principle implies important duties for governments and polities.
And Germany and France would be held to be in dereliction of their duties to a functioning Europe.
If Germany’s current-account surpluses, currently running at 9% of GDP, were universalized, with every member state’s government, private sector, and households net savers, the euro would shoot through the roof, destroying most of Europe’s manufacturing.
Equally, universalized Greco-Latin deficits would turn Europe into a basket case.
The trick, and our rational duty, is to embrace policies and to build institutions that are consistent with balanced trade and financial flows.
Put differently, authentic German rectitude cannot be achieved without a form of redistribution that is bound to clash with the interests of, say, a French or a Greek oligarchy too lazy to come to terms with its own unsustainability.
A critic of this German idea for reforming Europe might credibly ask why anyone should do their rational duty, rather than remain on the time-honored path of narrow self-interest?
The only sound answer is: because there is no truly rational alternative.
Or, rather, the alternatives are all cant.
A Young State in an Uncertain World
ALMATY – In mid-November, Kazakhstan hosted the third annual “Astana Club,” a new independent and unbiased platform for dialogue among international experts, politicians, and media representatives on the “critical issues affecting all the countries of Eurasia.”
The event epitomized Kazakhstan’s foreign policy over the last two decades, at a moment when that policy is set to confront unprecedented tests.
Participants in this year’s Astana Club were as high-profile as they were diverse.
They included representatives of leading think tanks from Europe, Asia, the United States, and the Middle East; former presidents, such as Turkey’s Abdullah Gül and Slovenia’s Danilo Türk; former European Commissioner Benita Ferrero-Waldner; Indian member of parliament Shashi Tharoor; and CEO of Channel One Russia Konstantin Ernst.
The discussions took place in the Nazarbayev Centre, housed in an imposing and futuristic building designed by the renowned British architect Norman Foster.
In a scene reminiscent of the intergalactic assembly in Star Wars, participants sat at a large table encircling a map of Eurasia to discuss the emerging world order, great power rivalries, sanction wars, nuclear proliferation, and regional integration projects.
This combination of status-seeking public relations and the provision of public goods that characterizes the Astana Club discussions has long been a feature of Kazakhstan’s foreign policy.
For example, every three years Kazakhstan hosts a Congress of Leaders of World and Traditional Religions, for which it commissioned Foster to build another imposing and futuristic building, the Palace of Peace and Reconciliation.
Kazakhstan’s leadership has also worked to place itself at the forefront of the international non-proliferation movement.
And this past October, talks were held in Astana, the capital, on the Syrian crisis, with representatives of the Syrian government and some armed opposition groups in attendance – despite Kazakhstan’s distance from the tragic developments in that country.
This approach emerged soon after Kazakhstan’s independence in 1991, when the country initiated the Conference on Interaction and Confidence-Building Measures in Asia, modeled after the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (now the OSCE).
It reflects Kazakhstan’s appreciation of the liberal world order into which it was born in 1991 – an order that, at that time, had just received a major boost, with the Soviet Union’s collapse.
Kazakhstan was never one to settle for being an accepted member of the liberal world order.
It wanted to be exemplary, not just joining multilateral regimes and organizations, but also making its own contribution.
That is why Kazakhstan sought the chairmanship of the Organization for Security and Cooperation (OSCE) in Europe, which it obtained in 2010, and pursued a difficult but ultimately successful campaign to become a non-permanent UN Security Council member in 2017-2018.
Kazakhstan aspires eventually to join the advanced economies in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.
But the international community that Kazakhstan is trying so hard to impress is undergoing fundamental change.
Russia, the great power of Kazakhstan’s neighborhood, has unsettled the region with its invasion of Ukraine, in which it illegally annexed Crimea and started a war in the eastern Donbas region.
Compounding the problem, it seems that the United States under President Donald Trump cannot be counted on to continue constraining Russia or underwriting the post-1945 liberal world order that it created.
Having ridden to power on a wave of popular anger, Trump can’t even be counted on to follow its rules.
The European Union is similarly beset by internal political challenges – including negotiations with the United Kingdom over its withdrawal from the bloc – that stem from a surge in anti-establishment and nationalist sentiment.
China has sought to step into the breach of global leadership – and has been met with surprisingly strong approval from the rest of the world.
Such tectonic shifts are jarring enough for the large powers that bring them about; for smaller countries, they can be even more disorienting.
Even as some welcome the demise of Western hegemony, the fact is that, for a country like Kazakhstan, unpredictability implies danger.
It does not help that the emerging powers are less bound to international human rights norms and conventions, and thus less likely to attempt to enforce them.
Kazakhstan achieved independence at a time when international cooperation, free trade, and collective security were encouraged, and it has long worked to support these principles.
Though Kazakhstan’s government, like other young states in the region, has lagged in advancing democracy and human rights, it has at least avoided foreclosing them entirely.
For now, Kazakhstan is trying to stay the course.
But if today’s trends continue, it might lose direction.
The Case for Burning Ivory
JOHANNESBURG – Kenya is about to destroy its entire stockpile of elephant ivory.
More than 100 metric tons of “white gold” – both illegally harvested (confiscated from poachers or traders) and naturally accruing (from natural mortality) – will go up in smoke this weekend.
In China – where the majority of the world’s ivory is consumed or stockpiled – the recently reported price is $1,100 per kilogram, putting the total value of the material to be burned at roughly $110 million.
To most economists, the idea of destroying something with so much value is anathema.
But there are good reasons for a country – even one as poor as Kenya – to surrender its ivory wealth to the flames.
For starters, stockpile destruction fortifies the credibility of demand-reduction campaigns in East Asia, without which the poaching problem will never be solved.
Demand reduction aims to weaken the market for the product by changing consumer tastes.
As prices drop, so does the incentive for poachers to kill elephants.
When countries keep their stockpiles, however, they signal that they anticipate being able to sell ivory in the future.
This undermines the credibility of demand-reduction efforts; if the trade is likely to be legalized one day, any stigma associated with ivory consumption will be eroded.
Proponents of a regulated, legal international ivory trade argue that demand-reduction efforts can coexist with a limited legitimate supply.
But this line of reasoning has a dangerous weakness: It assumes that a legal cartel – one proposed model for regulating supply – would crowd out illegal suppliers by providing ivory to the market at a lower cost.
This assumption is dubious at best.
The quantities traded through a legal mechanism would be insufficient to flood the market and suppress the price.
Indeed, with legalized trade undermining demand-reduction efforts, the price of ivory is likely to remain high, ensuring that poaching continues.
Some southern African countries argue that they should be allowed to sell their ivory in CITES-permitted, one-off sales to fund conservation efforts aimed at maintaining healthy elephant populations.
But, aside from the low probability in some countries that the revenue would be directed to that end, it is not clear that much money would be made.
Under CITES regulations, governments are permitted to sell only to other governments.
But what other governments are willing to pay may be as low as one-tenth of the illicit value.
And even then, governments can sell only naturally accrued ivory, not what was confiscated from poachers or illicit dealers.
China and the United States are in the process of formulating bans on domestic ivory trade, so it is not clear which governments would be interested in purchasing African stockpiles.
Vietnam and Laos are likely candidates, but they are also part of the infamous “golden triangle,” where illegal trade in wildlife and wildlife products continues to thrive.
The possibility of the legal ivory trade shifting to poorly regulated markets calls for a concerted international response, spearheaded by African governments through coalitions like the Elephant Protection Initiative, together with countries such as China.
Preserving – rather than burning – stockpiles is the inefficient choice.
Maintaining a stockpile is administratively and operationally expensive – and often pointless.
Inventory management is labor-intensive and technologically demanding.
The ivory also must be air-conditioned to prevent the tusks from cracking or becoming brittle (important factors for attracting higher prices).
Given the low probability of being able to sell ivory in the future, the cost of storing and protecting it is unlikely to be recouped.
Meanwhile, criminal syndicates need only corrupt a handful of local officials to make off with the goods.
Then there are the high opportunity costs of investment in maintaining stockpiles.
The scarce human and financial resources allocated toward stockpile management could be more efficiently directed toward landscape preservation efforts (which can become self-sustaining over time through payment for ecosystem services).
Finally, burning ivory worth millions of dollars has an undeniable symbolic impact.
It sends a clear message: Ivory belongs to elephants and to no one else.
And it makes clear that elephants are worth more alive than dead.
Indeed, elephants’ value is anything but symbolic.
Elephants are a keystone species for preserving important ecosystems.
And yet rampant poaching is destroying elephant populations across Africa, killing, on average, 30,000 a year.
Poaching also has a negative impact on communities, benefiting a few at the expense of the many.
Recent research has shown that community conservancies (areas set aside for wildlife conservation) in northern Kenya are highly effective forms of landscape (and therefore elephant) preservation, provided the right incentives are in place.
This is important because in countries like Kenya and Tanzania, the majority of wildlife exists outside formally protected areas.
Kenya should be commended for making a wise – and efficient – decision.
Its neighbors, as well as countries farther south, should follow its example.
Ideally, all range-state countries should destroy their stockpiles to overcome the regional collective action problem.
Doing so would send an unmistakable signal to the global market: Ivory is not for sale, not now and not in the future.
Toward a People-Centered ASEAN Community
SEOUL – I am delighted that my first meeting with the leaders of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations comes at a historic moment: the 50th anniversary of ASEAN’s founding.
During those 50 years, not only my country, the Republic of Korea, but almost all of Asia has been utterly transformed.
ASEAN’s role in harnessing and spreading economic dynamism has been essential to the region’s success.
For Korea, ASEAN has undoubtedly been a special and valued friend.
Last year alone, some six million Koreans visited ASEAN member states, both as tourists and for business.
Approximately 500,000 citizens of ASEAN member states now live and work in Korea, while roughly 300,000 Koreans live and work in ASEAN countries.
This is one example of why Korea’s ties with ASEAN are more than just intergovernmental relations.
Our relationship is deepened in the most personal way possible, through the intertwining of so many individuals’ lives.
This fact should not surprise anyone.
ASEAN 2025: Forging Ahead Together, which was endorsed by ASEAN leaders at their 27th Summit in November 2015, states that the group strives to be a “people-centered, people-oriented community” that seeks to build a caring and sharing society which is inclusive and where the well-being, livelihood, and welfare of the people are enhanced.
“People first” has been my longstanding political philosophy as well, and it is a vision in line with the spirit of Korea’s “candlelight revolution” that lit and heated up the winter in Korea a year ago.
Korea and ASEAN share a common philosophy that values people, and that shared outlook will set the path that Korea and ASEAN take together in the years and decades ahead.
Since 2010, Korea and ASEAN have made significant strides together as strategic partners.
Korea-ASEAN cooperation so far, however, has remained focused mainly on government-led collaboration in political, security, and economic affairs.
I intend to help advance Korea-ASEAN relations while placing a high priority on the “people” – both Koreans and the people of ASEAN.
My vision is to create, in cooperation with ASEAN, a “peace-loving, people-centered community where all members are better off together.”
This can be summed up in “three Ps”: People, Prosperity, and Peace.
To realize this vision, I will pursue “people-centered diplomacy.”
So, from this point onward, cooperation between Korea and ASEAN will be developed in a way that respects public opinion among all of the peoples of our association, gains their support, and invites their hands-on participation.
To this end, and in commemoration of ASEAN’s 50th anniversary, we have designated this year as “Korea-ASEAN Cultural Exchange Year,” and actively promoted various cultural and people-to-people exchanges.
Last September, the ASEAN Culture House (ACH) opened in Korea’s southern port city of Busan.
The ACH is the first of its kind to be opened in an ASEAN dialogue partner country, and it is expected to serve as a hub for cultural and people-to-people exchanges between Korea and ASEAN members.
The Korean government will spare no effort to expand these exchanges, especially among the young people who will lead Korea-ASEAN relations in the future.
We should also work to build a community of peace where people are safe.
In Asia, we all are facing the threat posed by North Korea’s nuclear weapons and missiles, as well as non-traditional security threats, including terrorism, violent extremism, and cyber-attacks on our businesses, our social and civic infrastructure, and our official institutions.
The Korean government will strive to ensure that both Koreans and the people of ASEAN are able to lead happy and safe lives, which means cooperating with all ASEAN member states, at both the bilateral and multilateral level, to overcome the security challenges that we jointly face.
Finally, I will endeavor to promote greater mutual prosperity, which benefits citizens of both ASEAN and Korea.
To ensure the sustainability of people-centered cooperation, all countries in the region must grow and develop together.
Creating a structure for mutual prosperity requires lowering regional and transnational barriers to facilitate the flow of goods and promote people-to-people interactions.
In short, ASEAN’s dynamism must now be tied to its inclusiveness.
That is why Korea will actively support the “Master Plan on ASEAN Connectivity 2025” and “Initiative for ASEAN Integration (IAI) Work Plan,” both of which call for enhancing the connectivity between ASEAN economies and citizens.
We will also accelerate the pace of negotiations for the further liberalization of a Korea-ASEAN Free Trade Agreement (FTA), in order to pave the way for freer and more inclusive growth in the region.
Korea is now preparing for yet another “hot” winter: the PyeongChang Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games, to be held in February 2018.
Our preparations are focused on ensuring that these Games deliver a message of reconciliation, peace, mutual understanding, and cooperation throughout the world.
I happily invite you all to discover a peaceful and joyous winter in PyeongChang, and experience the dynamism sweeping through Korea and ASEAN.
Don’t miss an opportunity to find out and enjoy what Korea and ASEAN share in common.
Securing Land Rights in Africa
WASHINGTON, DC – Earlier this month, Liberian President and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Ellen Johnson Sirleaf warned that Africa would continue to be stalked by poverty, hunger, and famine until governments provide smallholder farmers with secure rights to land.
She was speaking from experience, both personal and political.
Sirleaf and her tiny West African country are perfect examples of the steep toll that insecure land rights take on individuals, communities, and countries.
Disputes over land ownership were a key driver of Liberia’s bloody 14-year civil war.
And overlapping claims to land continue to foment conflict and impede foreign investment.
Not even the president is immune to weak land-tenure laws; squatters invaded a four-acre parcel that Sirleaf bought in 1979, and refused to move for years.
Stories like these can be heard across the continent.
According to the World Bank, more than 90% of Africa’s rural land is undocumented.
Overlapping and conflicting land-management systems are the norm, as are inaccessible, out-of-date, incomplete, inaccurate, or nonexistent land records.
But while dysfunctional systems of land tenure have no doubt cost African governments millions in foreign investment, they have hurt African farmers most directly.
Africa’s small family farmers – already burdened by soil degradation, climate change, and resource competition fueled by surging populations – face an even more challenging bureaucratic hurdle: no paper to prove that the land they call home is theirs.
Uncertain of their ability to control their farms into the next season, farmers’ planning horizons shrink.
Instead of investing in terraced fields, planting trees, and buying high-quality fertilizer, Africa’s farmers seek to maximize short-term profits.
This is particularly true of female farmers, who face an additional thicket of discriminatory land laws and customs.
Studies show there is no way to reduce poverty, improve nutrition, or achieve other key development goals without strengthening land rights, especially for women.
Secure rights to land are simply a prerequisite of development.
In Tanzania, women with secure rights earn three times more than their landless counterparts.
In Nepal, children whose mothers have secure land rights are 33% more likely to be well nourished.
And in Zambia, in areas where women’s land rights are weak and HIV infection rates are high, women are less likely to make investments to improve harvests – even when their husbands are not HIV positive.
These women anticipate that they will be forced off their land if and when they are widowed, and that expectation depresses farm investment, affecting harvests and family nutrition for years.
Given that there are 400 million female farmers, such findings suggest the high global costs – measured in terms of lost productivity and unrealized economic potential – of insecure land rights for women.
In Africa, the signs of insecure land rights are literally etched into the landscape.
In some regions, poor recordkeeping and weak administrative structures have forced landowners to post notices in their fields or on their homes, warning prospective buyers that they may be duped into purchasing parcels from people who are not the legitimate owners.
In many countries, there is simply no way to know who owns what piece of property.
Communities with clear legal control over land manage those resources more assiduously than those with shaky tenure.
The same can be said for individuals.
In Ghana, farmers with strong land rights are 39% more likely to plant trees.
In Ethiopia, farmers are 60% more likely to invest in preventing soil erosion when they have secure rights to their plots.
But while the evidence is clear, nearly one billion people worldwide continue to lack secure rights to the land they rely on for a living.
As the Cadasta Foundation and Habitat for Humanity’s Solid Ground campaign recently demonstrated in a new online survey, these uncertainties have far-reaching consequences.
Weak land rights can limit farmers’ access to crop insurance, make it difficult for their children to register for school, and can even contribute to higher rates of suicide.
Currently, Liberia’s Senate is considering legislation that would dramatically strengthen land rights for farmers, including female farmers.
Many other countries in Africa (notably Rwanda and Zambia) and in Asia (including Myanmar and India) have done, or are planning to do, the same.
These efforts should be supported, expedited, and replicated.
Yet people are not waiting for their leaders to act.
Innovative technologies are already providing a path forward for communities in countries with unwilling or incapable governments.
Advances in GPS, drones, and cloud computing have given communities the ability to document land – with or without official recognition or support.
Together with the Cadasta Foundation, communities from Nigeria to India are using hand-held devices to map property and support land claims with hard evidence, thereby allowing for incremental strengthening of tenure.
Liberia’s drive to spearhead a continent-wide overhaul of land rights is welcome; leaders like Sirleaf clearly understand the challenges that come with weak land laws.
But structural changes will take time.
In the absence of more assertive government intervention, it will be up to communities and individuals to leapfrog conventional efforts and fill in the blank spaces on the map.
Natural Solutions to Climate Change
OXFORD – In response to climate change, land is key.
Today, agriculture, forestry, and other land uses account for roughly a quarter of global greenhouse-gas emissions.
But adopting sustainable land management strategies could provide more than one-third of the near-term emission reductions needed to keep warming well below the target – 2°C above pre-industrial levels – set by the Paris climate agreement.
Conservation organizations like mine have long been working to balance the interaction between people and nature.
But only recently have we fully grasped just how important land-use management is in addressing climate change.
With the development of remote sensing, artificial intelligence, and biogeochemical modeling, we can better forecast outcomes, and develop strategies to manage and minimize adverse consequences.
Some of the most promising ways to mitigate climate change are what we call “natural climate solutions”: the conservation, restoration, and improved management of land, in order to increase carbon storage or avoid greenhouse-gas emissions in landscapes worldwide.
The full potential of these solutions is detailed in a new study produced by my organization, the Nature Conservancy, and 15 other leading institutions.
Among the most important natural climate solutions is protecting “frontier forests” – pristine woodlands that serve as natural carbon sinks.
Intact tropical and northern forests, as well as savannas and coastal ecosystems, store huge amounts of carbon accumulated over centuries.
When these areas are disturbed, carbon is released.
Preservation of frontier habitats also helps regulate water flows, reduces the risk of flooding, and maintains biodiversity.
Reforestation is another important natural solution.
Globally, an estimated two billion hectares (4.9 billion acres) of land has been deforested or degraded.
Because trees are the best carbon-capture-and-storage technology the world has, reversing these numbers would bring a significant reduction in global carbon levels.
We estimate that the world could capture three gigatons of CO2 annually – equivalent to taking more than 600 million cars off the roads – simply by planting more trees.
A third category of natural solution is agricultural reform.
From field to fork, the food sector is a major contributor to climate change through direct and indirect emissions, and by its often-negative effects on soil health and deforestation.
Recognizing these risks, 23 global companies – including Nestlé, McDonald’s, Tesco, and Unilever – recently signed a commitment to halt deforestation in Brazil’s Cerrado savanna.
The region, which covers a quarter of the country, has come under growing pressure from production of beef, soy, and other commodities, together with the associated infrastructure.
As the Cerrado pledge demonstrates, when governments and businesses come together to address land-use challenges, the impact is potent.
Natural climate solutions have the potential to reduce CO2 emissions by an estimated 11.3 billion tons a year – equal to a complete halt in burning oil, according to our study.
One recent study calculated that if Brazil reached zero deforestation by 2030, it would add 0.6% of GDP, or about $15 billion, to its economy.
Communities also reap secondary benefits – such as rural regeneration, improved food and water security, and coastal resilience – when natural climate solutions are implemented.
Yet, despite the data supporting better land-use decision-making, something isn’t adding up.
In 2016, the world witnessed a dramatic 51% increase in forest loss, equivalent to an area about the size of New Zealand.
We need to buck this trend now, and help the world realize that land-use planning is not simply a conservation story.
Some countries are moving in the right direction.
The Indian government, for example, has set aside $6 billion for states to invest in forest restoration.
In Indonesia, the government created a dedicated agency to protect and restore peatlands, bogs, and swamp-like ecosystems that have immense CO2 storage capabilities.
But they are the exceptions.
Of the 160 countries that committed to implementing the Paris climate agreement, only 36 have specified land-use management in their emissions-reduction strategies.
Overcoming inertia will not be easy.
Forests, farms, and coasts vary in size, type, and accessibility.
Moreover, the lives of hundreds of millions of people are tied to these ecosystems, and projects that restore forest cover or improve soil health require focused planning, a massive undertaking for many governments.
One way to get things moving, especially in the agricultural sector, would be to remove or redirect subsidies that encourage excessive consumption of fertilizers, water, or energy in food production.
As Indian government officials reminded their peers during a World Trade Organization meeting earlier this year, meaningful agricultural reforms can begin only when rich countries reduce the “disproportionately large” subsidies they give their own farmers.
Supporting innovation and entrepreneurship can also help power change.
New processes and technologies in landscape planning, soil analysis, irrigation, and even alternative proteins such as plant-based meat are making agriculture and land use more sustainable.
Similarly, changes in the construction industry, which is turning to more efficiently produced products like cross-laminated timber (CLT), can help reduce carbon pollution.
Finally, financing options for natural climate solutions must be dramatically increased.
While payments to conserve forests are starting to flow under the UN’s REDD+ program, and the Green Climate Fund has committed $500 million for forest protection payments, total public investment in sustainable land use remains inadequate.
According to the Climate Policy Initiative, public financing for agriculture, forestry, and land-use mitigation attracted just $3 billion in 2014, compared to $49 billion for renewable energy generation and $26 billion for energy efficiency.
At the UN climate change meeting that just concluded in Bonn, Germany, global leaders reaffirmed that the world cannot respond adequately to rising temperatures if governments continue ignoring how forests, farms, and coasts are managed.
Now that there is a firm consensus, governments must act on it.
How Best to Promote Research and Development
CAMBRIDGE – Start-ups, incubators, accelerators, angel capital, venture capital, mergers and acquisitions, initial public offerings, a liquid stock market, techno-parks, a major university or two, and a group of specialized law firms.
Many believe that once you have built up this ecosystem, à la Silicon Valley, you can become the next Route 128 in Massachusetts, the next Research Triangle in North Carolina, or the next Start-Up Israel.
But, while success breeds imitation, the opposite is often not the case.
Complex structures with many interdependent pieces are not created out of whole cloth.
They emerge from idiosyncratic path-dependent processes, whereby each organizational innovation changes the ecosystem, making other changes feasible.
Trying to copy the resulting ecosystem is like trying to build a bridge with no scaffolding: it cannot be done, because the structure cannot bear its own weight while it is being built.
Clearly, there is something appealing about a start-up-based innovation strategy.
It feels democratic, accessible, and so California.
But it is definitely not the only way to boost R&D, or even the main way, and it is certainly not the way most major innovations in the US came about during the twentieth century.
The alternative strategy lies at the opposite end of the distribution of firm size – with big business.
Joseph Schumpeter stumbled onto these two approaches at different points in his life.
When he published The Theory of Economic Development in 1911 at age 28, he emphasized that innovation came from the spirit of entrepreneurs in a process of creative destruction.
By 1942 when a 59-year-old Schumpeter published the book Capitalism, Socialism, and Democracy, he realized that a lot of the innovation was coming from very large corporations that faced rather limited competition.
A paradigmatic example is the American Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&T) and its Bell Labs, a story meticulously recounted by Jon Gertner in his 2012 book The Idea Factory.
The research, discoveries, and products that emerged from this single entity are astounding: not only reliable relays and switches for landline telephony, but also radar, lasers, the transistor, the integrated circuit, the fax machine, satellite communications, Shannon’s information theory, the theory of computation, six sigma quality control, and even cosmic microwave background radiation.
All of this happened inside a corporate behemoth, which could afford the lab thanks to its monopoly on local telephony and on the equipment used to provide the service, which was manufactured by AT&T’s subsidiary, Western Electric.
AT&T’s monopoly position was always controversial in the competition-minded US regulatory system.
So the company had to earn the right to be a monopolist by constantly improving its service and using its research power for national purposes such as military defense. To renew its corporate charter in 1956, it even had to agree to license all of its old patents royalty-free and to license all new patents at low cost.
If AT&T had to be a monopoly, it had to be a monopoly that benefited society at large, not just its shareholders, through breakthrough research.
Organizing research and development within a large corporation may be much less challenging than trying to generate the complex ecosystem that a start-up approach would require (which may be why the first preceded the second historically).
Access to finance, managerial resources, incubation, acceleration, oversight, and accumulated experience may be much easier to achieve.
And a large corporation may be more patient than angel and venture capitalists – and thus more willing to take risks and bet on longer-term projects, as AT&T did.
This is not just a twentieth-century story.
The bulk of R&D spending today occurs within large corporations.
The world’s largest R&D companies, measured by their budgets, are Volkswagen, Samsung, Intel, Microsoft, Roche, Novartis, Toyota, Johnson & Johnson, Google, and Merck.
None operates out of its parents’ garage while awaiting an infusion of venture capital.
Developing an R&D capacity is critical for many middle-income countries, and both the World Bank and the regional development banks have programs to help.
Most often, these programs are inspired by the start-up culture of Silicon Valley.
Examples include Start-Up Chile and Ruta N in Colombia, which attempt to create complex ecosystems from scratch.
Israel is often cited as a precedent for such efforts.
But Israeli start-ups exist in an ecosystem created by decades of public investment in military R&D. In the meantime, countries like Chile and Colombia have given a free pass to their large conglomerates, which could be the kernel of the more conventional corporation-centered approach.
For example, it was Australia’s BHP Billiton, not state-owned CODELCO or privately owned Antofagasta, that launched an R&D effort on mining technologies in Chile.
More broadly, middle-income countries are not short of companies with significant financial and managerial resources and plenty of market power.
But these firms have been mostly missing in action in terms of innovation and R&D, as a recent study by the Inter-American Development Bank has shown.
As societies consider their R&D strategies, they must find ways to coax their largest corporations into a more AT&T-like bargain.
If citizens are to tolerate or even support these companies’ power, companies must use it in ways that bring outsize benefits to the rest of society.
Their R&D budgets, their patent history, and their innovations are part of what they should brag about in public.
A more demanding public policy may generate a more dynamic corporate sector.
In the case of AT&T, it was the looming threat of break-up or forced divestment that did the trick.
With large emerging-market conglomerates, a “tough love” approach, rather than just more tax incentives, has, to my knowledge, never been tried outside of South Korea.
It could be a win-win proposition, even for the start-ups.
Inside the Mind of the Mass Shooter
LONDON – This weekend, Stephen Paddock opened fire on a country music festival in Las Vegas, Nevada, from an overlooking hotel, killing at least 59 people and injuring more than 500 others.
Paddock, a 64-year-old former accountant with no criminal record, was ultimately found in his hotel room, dead, with some 23 guns, including more than ten assault weapons.
Police later found an additional 19 firearms, explosives, and several thousands of rounds of ammunition in Paddock’s home.
What the authorities have not yet found, however, is a motive.
More details about Paddock’s mindset and objectives will probably come to light in the coming days.
But so-called “lone wolf” mass shooters – individual perpetrators with no ties to any movement or ideology – are not a new phenomenon, and these episodes have offered important clues about the motivations and thought processes of mass shooters.
Most mass shooters do not survive their own attacks; they either kill themselves or let police do the job.
But those who have survived have shown some common features, with narcissistic personality disorder and paranoid schizophrenia being the two most frequent diagnoses.
That was the case with Anders Breivik, the Norwegian far-right terrorist who, in 2011, detonated a van bomb that killed eight people, before shooting dead 69 participants in a youth summer camp.
He remains in prison in Norway.
A look at behavior prior to attacks reinforces this view.
In The Wiley Handbook of the Psychology of Mass Shootings, Grant Duwe, the director of research and evaluation for the Minnesota Department of Corrections, examined 160 cases of mass shootings in the United States between 1915 and 2013.
Duwe found that 60% of the perpetrators had either been diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder or exhibited signs of serious mental disturbance before the attack.
About one third had contact with mental-health professionals, who had diagnosed them, most commonly, with paranoid schizophrenia.
The second most common diagnosis was depression.
Yet, given that most people who suffer from these disorders are harmless to the public, these diagnoses do not tell the whole story.
According to Duwe, the difference may lie partly in an acute sense of being persecuted – and an acute desire for revenge.
This view is corroborated by Paul Mullen, an Australian forensic psychiatrist.
Based on a detailed investigation of five mass murderers whom he personally examined, Mullen concluded that such killers struggle to reconcile their own grandiose ideas of themselves with an inability to succeed at work or in relationships.
The only explanation, they decide, is that others are out to sabotage them.
In fact, Mullen’s study revealed that the path to mass murder is rather stereotypical.
All of Mullen’s subjects had been bullied or socially excluded as children.
They were all suspicious and rigid, qualities that helped to deepen their isolation.
They constantly blamed their problems on others, believing that their community had rejected them; they failed to consider that they themselves were too wearisome or self-centered.
Mullen’s subjects obsessively held grudges against anyone whom they viewed as part of the group or community that refused to accept them.
They ruminated relentlessly over past humiliations, a habit that fueled resentment and, eventually, revenge fantasies, leading them to use mass murder to achieve infamy and to hurt those perceived to have hurt them – even if it meant a “welcome death” for themselves.
Given this, there is usually a kind of warped logic to mass shooters’ choice of victims.
In the case of school shootings, such as the Columbine High School massacre of 1999, that logic is clear: to punish those who have excluded the perpetrators socially.
Likewise, workplace rampages are often triggered by a firing or layoff.
But even in cases where the targets seem random, the logic usually emerges eventually, even if it is a matter of punishing an entire community or society.
In Paddock’s case, many questions obviously remain unanswered, beginning with why he chose that particular concert to attack.
But the contours of his story are beginning to emerge.
Reinforcing the loner trope, one neighbor said that the “weird” Paddock “kept to himself”; living next to him was “like living next to nothing.”
It has also been revealed that in 2012, Paddock filed a negligence lawsuit against a Las Vegas hotel where he had fallen; litigiousness can be a hallmark of the resentful and paranoid.
Duwe argues that, contrary to popular belief, such gunmen do not “just snap.”
Though roughly two-thirds of mass public shooters experience a traumatic event immediately before carrying out the attack – usually the loss of a job or relationship – most spend weeks or even years deliberating and preparing to get their revenge.
In Paddock’s case, such quiet planning may explain the armory found in his home and hotel room, which he rented several days prior to the attack.
After the massacre, more than half of mass public shooters either commit suicide directly or provoke the police into killing them.
This rate is nearly ten times higher than for homicide offenders in general.
Does this reveal, Duwe asks, just how mentally plagued these perpetrators are?
Perhaps they believe they can no longer bear the agony of life; once they have “settled the score” for the perceived slights that have produced it, there is no reason left to live.
Mullen argues that the script for this particular type of suicide has become entrenched in modern culture, and continues to attract willing lead actors.
If we are unable to use the knowledge we have gleaned from past experience to prevent them from taking the stage, they will continue to take aim at audiences.
Free Trade Without the US
SANTIAGO – How should Latin America respond to US President Donald Trump’s America-first approach to the global economy?
Here’s one possible answer: build a free-trade area of the Americas without the United States.
Of course, the idea is far from new.
The founding fathers of Latin America’s republics talked about it two centuries ago. But it never came to pass.
In the 1960s, there was much discussion about Latin American integration.
Summit meetings were held and agreements signed.
But little progress on free trade followed. For most countries in the region, Europe or the US remained larger trading partners than their immediate neighbors.
In the early 1990s, then-US President George H.W. Bush grandly proposed a free-trade area from Alaska to Tierra del Fuego.
The US subsequently signed agreements with Canada, Mexico, Chile, Colombia, Peru, and Central America, but the ambitious and overarching north-south agreement did not materialize.
The good news is that most of the factors blocking regional free trade back then have disappeared.
So now is the right time to pick up on Simón Bolívar’s two-century-old idea.
One reason why a region-wide trade deal foundered was that proud Brazil was unwilling to attend a party whose main host was the US.
But if Trump sticks to his protectionist promises, we will no longer have to worry about US-Brazil rivalry within the same trade agreement.
In the past, US farm subsidies were also deal-breakers for large agricultural exporters like Argentina and, again, Brazil.
With the US out of the picture, this also becomes a non-issue.
As the 1990s progressed, left-wing populist governments came to power in a number of Latin American countries.
For these governments – in Argentina, Bolivia, Ecuador, Nicaragua, and, of course, Venezuela – free trade was a dirty “neoliberal” phrase.
For their leaders, too, an agreement with the US was out of the question.
Today, that brand of populism is (knock on wood) in retreat across Latin America.
In Argentina, the Peronists have lost the presidency; in Brazil, President Dilma Rousseff got herself impeached; and in Venezuela, President Nicolás Maduro’s increasingly dictatorial regime is teetering on the edge of the abyss.
Ecuador also may soon end its flirtation with populism: Rafael Correa’s handpicked successor did less well than expected in the recent first round of the country’s presidential election.
So, with the three main stumbling blocks gone, what is preventing a free-trade agreement of the Americas from being signed?
Nothing much, except for policy inertia and lack of clear leadership.
But there is no shortage of regional leaders who could carry the torch of trade integration from the Rio Grande to the Cabo de Hornos.
Aside from their wariness of the US, past Brazilian presidents also feared their domestic business establishment, which never met a tariff or a non-tariff barrier it did not like.
That protectionist sentiment, always strongest in the industrial heartland of São Paulo, is still there.
But with Brazil just beginning to emerge from its deepest recession in decades, Brazilian businesses are eagerly seeking new customers.
And with China slowing, Europe mired in its own crisis, and the US walling itself in, the region’s growing markets have fresh appeal.
Something similar has happened to Mexico.
Its leaders always talked the talk of regional free trade, but no Sherlock Holmes was needed to discover that their real interest lay in the US market, where over 80% of Mexican exports go.
Now that Trump has called Mexican immigrants rapists and has called for a wall on the border (along with a tariff on Mexican exports to pay for it), trade intimacy with the US is losing – how can one put it politely? – some of its appeal.
So it should come as no surprise that Mexican politicians and businesspeople are looking south with newfound enthusiasm.
Argentina also has reasons to back regional free trade.
President Mauricio Macri’s year-old administration is naturally inclined toward economic liberalism, and Argentina is caught today in the straitjacket of the external tariff of the Mercosur regional trade agreement with Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay.
The least traumatic way to achieve greater openness without having to blow up the existing agreement is to have Mercosur join a larger free-trade area.
That transition would suit Argentina well.
With Brazil, Mexico, and Argentina pushing in the same direction, the issue of leadership would be solved automatically.
Chile, which for political reasons has always wanted to bring together the more liberal economies of the Pacific with the more protectionist regimes of the Atlantic, would have plenty of reasons to help move the process forward.
And Canada, under Prime Minister Justin Trudeau (everybody’s favorite English-speaking leader nowadays), would be most welcome to join.
Yes, Venezuela’s Maduro would object and denounce a neoliberal conspiracy against him.
But, given his rock-bottom standing in the region, most countries would regard this as an additional incentive to join the new bloc.
Nicaragua, Bolivia, and perhaps Ecuador might drag their feet.
But they lack the political and economic heft to stop a deal.
A hemispheric free-trade agreement would not have to start from scratch.
The Pacific Alliance, which already binds together Mexico, Colombia, Chile, and Peru, is a useful starting point.
That agreement focuses on trade in goods and services, trade facilitation, rules of origin, and dispute resolution.
In any new deal, non-tariff barriers and government procurement, two sets of instruments often used for hidden and not-so-hidden protectionism in Latin America, ought to follow common standards.
So should labor and environmental practices.
The always-prickly issues of investment and intellectual property should be a part of any new deal; but, with the US absent, some of the more controversial rules that North American businesses have lobbied for could now be excluded.
So, yes, the era of free trade across much of the Americas finally may have arrived.
And we have Trump’s nationalist and protectionist bullying to thank for it.
Latin America’s Rising Right
LAGUNA BEACH – From changes in government in Argentina and Brazil to mid-course policy corrections in Chile, Latin American politics appears to be undergoing a rightward shift.
But rather than being “pulled” by the attractiveness of the economic policies that the right is advocating, this complex phenomenon is predominantly a reflection of the “push” implied by anemic growth and the disappointing provision of public goods, especially social services.
Indeed, we can think of the shift as a Latin American variant of the West’s blossoming romance with anti-establishment movements.
And that means that the region’s governments must be seen to deliver to their citizens.
Otherwise, the shift will prove to be only a stop on an uncertain path – politically more complicated and economically harder to navigate – toward an even less stable destination.
The evidence of the ongoing political change comes in many forms.
After years of fiscally irresponsible populist rule by the Kirchner family, Argentina has opted for Mauricio Macri, a former businessman running on a right-wing platform.
In Brazil, and pending final consideration by the Senate, President Dilma Rousseff has been sidelined by a “temporary impeachment,” with her replacement signaling a shift away from the policies of the leftist Workers’ Party.
Even incumbent governments in the region are altering their course.
In Chile, President Michelle Bachelet was reelected, but her government is signaling a move to the right on economic policy.
Cuba, under President Raúl Castro, is enlarging the legal scope for private businesses.
And in Venezuela, a country tragically flirting with “failed state” status, President Nicolás Maduro’s government confronts mounting economic and financial challenges stemming from fiscally unanchored policies begun under his predecessor, Hugo Chávez.
Facing widespread shortages of goods and malfunctioning markets, including for foreign exchange, his government has already lost control of the National Assembly, and the opposition is now seeking to shorten his term by constitutional means.
Several key factors are driving the region’s political dynamics.
The sharp drop in international prices for commodities, such as oil and copper, together with a slowing Chinese economy, has reduced the region’s export earnings and accentuated domestic economic challenges.
This has been aggravated by a more volatile environment for financial flows to emerging countries, more tentative foreign direct investment, and concern about the potential fallout for international trade from rising anti-globalization rhetoric in the unusual presidential race in the United States.
The resulting deterioration in economic performance, including deep recessions in Brazil and Venezuela, has accentuated popular dissatisfaction with public services and amplified long-standing worries about inequality and misappropriation of public funds.
Popular dissatisfaction is evident even in traditionally well-managed countries, such as Chile, where lower-income groups have done relatively well in recent years and where the scale of official fraud – documented and alleged – pales in comparison to neighboring countries.
For now, rightist parties and policy agendas are the main beneficiaries of the region’s economic and social disillusion.
The hope for many in the region is that political change can catalyze faster growth, by revamping existing policies and pursuing more effective anti-corruption campaigns.
But, again, unless today’s political winners deliver notably higher and significantly more inclusive growth, their electorates are likely to move on.
Viewed from a global perspective, the shift in Latin America is part of a broader rise in discontent with the “establishment.”
And it is not limited to governments. It also extends to private-sector elites, particularly banks and multinational companies.
In the US, the result has been a significant shift away from establishment politics, including the unanticipated emergence of Donald Trump as the presumptive Republican candidate and Bernie Sanders’s unexpectedly powerful challenge to Hillary Clinton on the Democratic side.
In Europe, anti-establishment parties have been gaining ground in local, regional, and national elections, complicating government formation (for example, in Spain) and influencing major policy decisions (such as the UK Conservative Party’s decision to hold the upcoming “Brexit” referendum).
With the exception of countries like the Philippines, where voters opted in last month’s presidential election for a blatantly anti-establishment candidate in Rodrigo Duterte, the tendency in the emerging world has been for adaptations within the confines of existing political elites.
That may well be the best way to characterize what is happening in much of Latin America.
Now it is up to these elites to respond effectively to the causes of popular anger, or risk facing the eventual emergence of anti-establishment movements, like their American and European counterparts.
That outcome, by seriously complicating the region’s political landscape, would further reduce governments’ scope for timely economic-policy adaptation.
After the Hurricanes
NEW YORK – Hurricane Harvey has left in its wake upended lives and enormous property damage, estimated by some at $150-180 billion.
But the rains that inundated the Texas coast for the better part of a week, and the hurricane that is about to hit South Florida, also raise deep questions about the United States’ economic system and politics.
It is ironic, of course, that an event so related to climate change would occur in a state that is home to so many climate-change deniers – and where the economy depends so heavily on the fossil fuels that drive global warming.
Of course, no particular climate event can be directly related to the increase in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.
But scientists have long predicted that such increases would boost not only average temperatures, but also weather variability – and especially the occurrence of extreme events such as Hurricane Harvey.
As the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change concluded several years ago, “There is evidence that some extremes have changed as a result of anthropogenic influences, including increases in atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases.”
Astrophysicist Adam Frank succinctly explained: “greater warmth means more moisture in the air which means stronger precipitation.”
To be sure, Houston and Texas could not have done much by themselves about the increase in greenhouse gases, though they could have taken a more active role in pushing for strong climate policies.
But local and state authorities could have done a far better job preparing for such events, which hit the area with some frequency.
In responding to the hurricane – and in funding some of the repair – everyone turns to government, just as they did in the aftermath of the 2008 economic crisis.
Again, it is ironic that this is now occurring in a part of the country where government and collective action are so frequently rebuked.
It was no less ironic when the titans of US banking, having preached the neoliberal gospel of downsizing government and eliminating regulations that proscribed some of their most dangerous and anti-social activities, turned to government in their moment of need.
There is an obvious lesson to be learned from such episodes: markets on their own are incapable of providing the protection that societies need.
When markets fail, as they often do, collective action becomes imperative.
And, as with financial crises, there is a need for preventive collective action to mitigate the impact of climate change.
That means ensuring that buildings and infrastructure are constructed to withstand extreme events, and are not located in areas that are most vulnerable to severe damage.
It also means protecting environmental systems, particularly wetlands, which can play an important role in absorbing the impact of storms.
It means eliminating the risk that a natural disaster could lead to the discharge of dangerous chemicals, as happened in Houston.
And it means having in place adequate response plans, including for evacuation.
Effective government investments and strong regulations are needed to ensure each of these outcomes, regardless of the prevailing political culture in Texas and elsewhere.
Without adequate regulations, individuals and firms have no incentive to take adequate precautions, because they know that much of the cost of extreme events will be borne by others. Without adequate public planning and regulation, including of the environment, flooding will be worse.
Without disaster planning and adequate funding, any city can be caught in the dilemma in which Houston found itself: if it does not order an evacuation, many will die; but if it does order an evacuation, people will die in the ensuing chaos, and snarled traffic will prevent people from getting out.
America and the world are paying a high price for devotion to the extreme anti-government ideology embraced by President Donald Trump and his Republican Party.
The world is paying, because cumulative US greenhouse-gas emissions are greater than those from any other country; even today, the US is one of the world’s leaders in per capita greenhouse-gas emissions.
But America is paying a high price as well: other countries, even poor developing countries, like Haiti and Ecuador, seem to have learned (often at great expense and only after some huge calamities) how to manage natural disasters better.
After the destruction of New Orleans by Hurricane Katrina in 2005, the shutdown of much of New York City by Sandy in 2012, the devastation wrought on Texas by Harvey, and now the prospect of Irma pummeling Florida, the US can and should do better.
It has the resources and skills to analyze these complex events and their consequences, and to formulate and implement regulations and investment programs that mitigate the adverse effects on lives and property.
What America doesn’t have is a coherent view of government by those on the right, who, working with special interests that benefit from their extreme policies, continue to speak out of both sides of their mouth.
Before a crisis, they resist regulations and oppose government investment and planning; afterwards, they demand – and receive – billions of dollars to compensate them for their losses, even those that could easily have been prevented.
One can only hope that America, and other countries, will not need more natural persuasion before taking to heart the lessons of Hurricane Harvey.
Ten Lessons from North Korea’s Nuclear Program
SEOUL – North Korea has produced a number of nuclear warheads and is developing ballistic missiles capable of delivering them around the world.
Many governments are debating how to prevent or slow further advances in North Korea’s capacity and what should be done if such efforts fail.
These are obviously important questions, but they are not the only ones.
It also is important to understand how North Korea has succeeded in advancing its nuclear and missile programs as far as it has, despite decades of international efforts.
It may be too late to affect North Korea’s trajectory decisively; but it is not too late to learn from the experience.
What follows are ten lessons that we ignore at our peril.
First, a government that possesses basic scientific knowhow and modern manufacturing capability, and is determined to develop a number of rudimentary nuclear weapons, will most likely succeed, sooner or later.
Much of the relevant information is widely available.
Second, help from the outside can be discouraged and limited but not shut down.
Black markets exist any time there is a profit to be made.
Certain governments will facilitate such markets, despite their obligation not to do so.
Third, there are limits to what economic sanctions can be expected to accomplish.
Although sanctions may increase the cost of producing nuclear weapons, history suggests that governments are willing to pay a significant price if they place a high enough value on having them.
There is also evidence that some or all of the sanctions will eventually disappear, as other governments come to accept the reality of a country’s nuclear status and choose to focus on other objectives.
That is what happened in the case of India.
Fourth, governments are not always willing to put global considerations (in this case, opposition to nuclear proliferation) ahead of what they see as their immediate strategic interests.
China opposes proliferation, but not as much as it wants to maintain a divided Korean Peninsula and ensure that North Korea remains a stable buffer state on its borders.
This limits any economic pressure China is prepared to place on North Korea over its nuclear efforts.
The United States opposed Pakistan’s development of nuclear weapons, but was slow to act, owing to its desire in the 1980s for Pakistani support in fighting the Soviet Union’s occupation of Afghanistan.
Fifth, some three quarters of a century since they were first and last used, and a quarter-century after the Cold War’s end, nuclear weapons are judged to have value.
This calculation is based on security more than prestige.
Decades ago, Israel made such a calculation in the face of Arab threats to eliminate the Jewish state.
More recently, Ukraine, Libya, and Iraq all gave up their nuclear weapons programs either voluntarily or under pressure. Subsequently, Ukraine was invaded by Russia, Iraq by the US, and Libya by the US and several of its European partners.
Saddam Hussein in Iraq and Muammar el-Qaddafi in Libya were ousted.
North Korea has avoided such a fate, and the third generation of the Kim family rules with an iron fist.
It is doubtful that the lesson is lost on Kim Jong-un.
Sixth, the Non-Proliferation Treaty – the 1970 accord that underpins global efforts to discourage the spread of nuclear weapons beyond the five countries (the US, Russia, China, the United Kingdom, and France) that are recognized as legitimate nuclear weapons states for an unspecified but limited period of time – is inadequate.
The NPT is a voluntary agreement.
Countries are not obliged to sign it, and they may withdraw from it, with no penalty, if they change their mind.
Inspections meant to confirm compliance are conducted largely on the basis of information provided by host governments, which have been known not to reveal all.
Seventh, new diplomatic efforts, like the recent ban on all nuclear weapons organized by the United Nations General Assembly, will have no discernable effect.
Such pacts are the modern-day equivalent of the 1928 Kellogg-Briand Pact, which outlawed war.
Eighth, there is a major gap in the international system.
There is a clear norm against the spread of nuclear weapons, but there is no consensus or treaty on what, if anything, is to be done once a country develops or acquires nuclear weapons.
The legally and diplomatically controversial options of preventive strikes (against a gathering threat) and preemptive strikes (against an imminent threat) make them easier to propose than to implement.
Ninth, the alternatives for dealing with nuclear proliferation do not improve with the passage of time.
In the early 1990s, the US considered using military force to nip the North Korean program in the bud, but held off for fear of triggering a second Korean War.
That remains the case today, when any force used would need to be much larger in scope and uncertain to succeed.
Finally, not every problem can be solved.
Some can only be managed.
It is much too soon, for example, to conclude that Iran will not one day develop nuclear weapons.
The 2015 accord delayed that risk, but by no means eliminated it.
It remains to be seen what can be done vis-à-vis North Korea.
Managing such challenges may not be satisfying, but often it is the most that can be hoped for.
Life After Pax Americana
NEW YORK – The post-1945 order constructed by the US in Europe and East Asia has been fraying at the edges for some time now.
President Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate agreement has only hastened its unraveling.
For the first time since the early years of General Charles de Gaulle’s presidency in France, a major Western leader – German Chancellor Angela Merkel – has stated openly that Europe can no longer rely on US leadership.
This might seem ironic, coming from a German and a confirmed Atlanticist, but it is actually fitting, because Germany, in its transformation from a murderous dictatorship into a peaceful liberal democracy, needed the US more than any country.
Perhaps we should be sanguine about the gradual end of Pax Americana.
No imperial system lasts forever.
An international order that made complete sense when the world was emerging from the ruins of World War II, only to enter a long Cold War between two nuclear superpowers, may no longer be adequate, and may stand in the way of better arrangements.
NATO’s purpose, in the blunt phrase of its first secretary general, Lord Hastings Ismay, was to “keep the Americans in, the Russians out, and the Germans down.”
But Germany no longer needs to be kept “down,” and there is some debate whether Russia should have been kept “out” after the collapse of the Soviet Union.
And Trump is right about one thing, even if he expresses it crudely: Europe, as well as Japan, has become too dependent on American military power.
This dependence on the US for collective security does not make American allies exactly into colonies.
And the US is not formally an imperial power.
But aspects of a common late imperial dilemma are visible in both East Asia and Western Europe today.
If the US were to give up its leadership role too quickly, chaos might follow and less benign powers might jump into the vacuum.
But if the US-led system remains in place for too long, it will prevent American dependencies from taking more responsibility for their security.
When imperial arrangements are dissolved, violence often results.
The Armenian genocide accompanied the demise of Ottoman power.
Murderous anti-Semitism and radical nationalism followed the fall of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.
Something similar happened when Josip Broz Tito’s little Balkan empire of Yugoslavia fell apart.
More than a million Hindus and Muslims lost their lives in horrific sectarian violence when the British Raj left a partitioned country to its devices.
This is not an argument in favor of imperialism.
But the age of Trump should make us ready to face the consequences once the US-led post-1945 order comes to an end.
American leadership has obviously been a flawed enterprise, resulting in unnecessary wars, and the support of too many unsavory allies in the struggle with Communism.
But there have been many positive factors, too.
Western Europe, Japan, and even, belatedly, South Korea and Taiwan, were able to become free and prosperous under the protection of the US.
Despite the excesses of anti-Communism, US dominance has also acted as a brake on ideological extremism.
Neither Communism, nor variations of fascism, or indeed radical nationalism, had much of a chance to develop in Europe under Pax Americana.
Recent elections in the Netherlands and France suggest that Trump may be serving as a deterrent, rather than a boost, to populist extremism in Europe.
But if the populist wave were to become bigger and more brutal, there is nobody in Washington now to discourage it.
In Japan, dependence on the US, and anxiety about Communism, has marginalized the left and kept a conservative party more or less permanently in power.
But the extremes of Japanese revanchism were also kept in check.
This may no longer be so easy, once the US is no longer seen as a reliable protector and fear of China turns into a panic.
Unlike some of her predecessors as Chancellor, Merkel, who grew up in East Germany, is wary of Russia’s strategic designs.
There is no doubt that Russia and China will benefit, at least in the short term, from America’s abdication of leadership.
Some people are not too bothered by this.
Russia is closer to Berlin or even Paris than Washington or New York.
There is a great deal of money to be made by cozying up to the Russian and Chinese regimes (as the US president knows only too well).
And the chance that either Russia or China would invade NATO countries or Japan might be slim.
But there will be a price to pay for increased vulnerability to Chinese and Russian encroachments.
No matter how irksome American dominance might have been, or how much people deplored some of the destructive wars that the US unleashed, criticism of US policies, presidents, and even cultural practices was not only permissible, but seen as a healthy sign of liberal democracy.
This was one of the “common values” that held the West together.
The same will not be true in a world dominated by China.
Criticism will quickly lead to repercussions, especially in the economic sphere.
Hollywood studios are already censoring the content of movies expected to make money in the Chinese market.
Western news media, eager to maintain access to Moscow or Beijing, will be under increasing pressure to be careful about what they print or broadcast.
This will hurt our own societies, which are built on the principles of openness and freedom of expression.
So even if the end of Pax Americana does not result in military invasions, or world wars, we should ready ourselves for a time when we might recall the American Empire with fond nostalgia.
Little England and Not-so-Great Britain
AMSTERDAM – As an Anglo-Dutchman – British mother, Dutch father – I cannot help but take Brexit rather personally.
I’m not a wholehearted Euro-enthusiast, but a European Union without Britain feels like losing a limb in a terrible accident.
Not all my fellow citizens are unhappy.
The Dutch anti-EU, anti-Muslim demagogue Geert Wilders tweeted: “Hurrah for the British!
Now it is our turn.”
This kind of sentiment is more alarming, and more ominous, than Brexit’s implications for the future of the British economy.
The urge to destroy can be contagious.
The United Kingdom’s image has changed literally overnight.
For more than 200 years, Britain represented a certain ideal of liberty and tolerance (at least for many Europeans; Indians might have taken a somewhat different view).
Anglophiles admired Britain for many reasons, including its relative openness to refugees from illiberal continental regimes.
It was a place where a man of Sephardic Jewish origin, Benjamin Disraeli, could become Prime Minister.
And it stood up to Hitler virtually alone in 1940.
The Hungarian-born writer Arthur Koestler, a former Communist who knew all about European political catastrophes, and was almost executed by Spanish fascists, escaped to Britain in 1940.
He called his adoptive country the “Davos for internally bruised veterans of the totalitarian age.”
My generation, born not long after the war, grew up with myths based on truth, promoted in comic books and Hollywood movies: myths of Spitfires fighting Messerschmitts over the home counties, of Winston Churchill’s growling defiance, and Scottish bagpipers walking onto the beaches of Normandy.
The image of Britain as a country of freedom was boosted further by the youth culture of the 1960s.
Spitfire pilots were replaced as vigorous symbols of liberty by the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, and the Kinks, whose music swept across Europe and the United States like a gust of fresh air.
Having a British mother filled me with a naive and undeserved sense of pride.
For me, despite its industrial decline, shrinking global influence, and increasingly inept football, something about Britain always remained best.
There were, of course, many reasons why 52% of those who voted backed the “Leave” campaign.
There are reasonable grounds for victims of industrial decline to feel aggrieved.
Neither the left nor the right looked after the interests of the old working class in busted mining towns, rusting ports, and decaying smokestack cities.
When those left behind by globalization and London’s Big Bang complained that immigrants were making it even harder to find jobs, they were too easily dismissed as racists.
But this cannot excuse an ugly strain of English nationalism, whipped up by Nigel Farage’s UK Independence Party and cynically exploited by the Conservative Party’s Brexiteers, led by former London Mayor Boris Johnson and Michael Gove, the justice secretary in Prime Minister David Cameron’s cabinet.
English xenophobia has thrived especially in areas where foreigners are rarely seen.
London, where most foreigners live, voted to remain in the EU by a wide margin.
Rural Cornwall, which benefits hugely from EU subsidies, voted to leave.
The most sickening irony for a European of my age and disposition lies in the way narrow-minded and dispiriting nationalism is so often expressed.
Bigotry against immigrants is cloaked in the very symbols of freedom that we grew up admiring, including film clips of Spitfires and references to Churchill’s finest hour.
The wilder Brexiteers – shaven heads, national flag tattoos – resemble the English football hooligans infesting European stadiums with their particular brand of violence.
But the genteel ladies and gentlemen in the shires of Little England, cheering the lies of Farage and Johnson with the kind of ecstasy once reserved for British rock stars abroad, are no less disquieting.
Many Brexiteers will say that there is no contradiction.
The wartime symbols were not misplaced at all.
To them, the argument for leaving the EU is no less about freedom than World War II was.
“Brussels,” after all, is a dictatorship, they say, and the British – or, rather, the English – are standing up for democracy.
Millions of Europeans, we are told, agree with them.
It is indeed true that many Europeans take this view.
But most are followers of Marine Le Pen, Geert Wilders, and other populist rabble-rousers, who promote plebiscites to undermine elected governments and abuse popular fears and resentments to clear their own paths to power.
The EU is not a democracy; nor does it pretend to be one.
But European decisions are still made by sovereign – and, more important, elected – national governments after endless deliberation.
This process is often opaque and leaves much to be desired.
But the liberties of Europeans will not be better served by blowing up the institutions that were carefully constructed in the ruins of the last calamitous European war.
If Brexit triggers a Europe-wide revolt against liberal elites, it would be the first time in history that Britain leads a wave of illiberalism in Europe.
This would be a great tragedy – for Britain, for Europe, and for a world in which most of the major powers already are turning toward increasingly illiberal politics.
The final irony is that the last hope for turning this tide and preserving the freedoms for which so much blood was shed probably now lies with Germany, the country that my generation grew up hating as the symbol of bloody tyranny.
But, so far at least, the Germans appear to have learned the lessons of history better than a disturbing number of Brits.
Where to Build Trump’s Wall?
CAMBRIDGE – What do Huntsville (Alabama), Princeton (Indiana), Georgetown (Kentucky), Blue Springs (Mississippi), San Antonio (Texas), Buffalo (West Virginia), and Greer (South Carolina) have in common? They are the locations where Toyota and BMW built their manufacturing plants in the United States.
None is in the US Rust Belt – the tract of industrial towns stretching from Michigan to eastern Pennsylvania – where much of the car industry and its suppliers were traditionally located.
Evidently, the US Rust Belt’s decline was not the exclusive doing of China and Mexico.
It was also caused by the auto industry’s geographic spread into other regions of the US, out of the clusters in which it had originally been concentrated.
And this shift resulted not so much because GM moved its plants, but because it lost market share to Toyota, Nissan, Honda, Hyundai, BMW, and Mercedes-Benz.
Of course, pointing this out does not reduce the pain for those affected.
But it does change the policy implications – and the lessons from the US example are relevant worldwide.
Two approaches have been pursued so far to help communities affected by this phenomenon.
The first is embodied in the US Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) program, which provides workers affected by international competition with financial support for retraining, job search, relocation, income maintenance, and health insurance.
The second approach is to provide trade protection to affected industries, as US President Donald Trump has promised to do.
Neither approach is likely to help the Rust Belt.
Any economy’s success is very much affected by the performance of that sliver of activities that can sell their output to outsiders.
And what is true for countries is also true for states, cities, and towns, provided we redefine what we mean by selling to “outsiders.”
These “export” activities have an outsize and amplified impact on the growth of the local economy as a whole.
Every geographic area must buy products it does not make and pay for them by selling to outsiders some of the output that it does make.
But outsiders have the option of buying from others.
So, these “export” activities face a level of competition that the local grocer, coffee shop, or barber does not.
Moreover, the income brought into the community by the “exporters” creates a large multiplier effect.
When a mine shuts down, the result is not just unemployed miners.
The grocer, coffee shop, and barber go out of business, and everybody leaves, turning the place into a ghost town.
The disruption can be caused not only by an industrial closure.
Once upon a time, there were many relatively small department-store chains and other retailers with headquarters spread throughout the US and outlets in a few towns.
These headquarters brought income into their town by providing back-office services to their network of stores.
But consolidation in the retail industry, driven in part by Walmart and Amazon, dealt a deathblow to many of these companies.
The impact on the local communities where these retailers were headquartered was as devastating as a mine closure: the “export” activity ceased and towns shrank by a multiple of each “export job” lost.
Video rentals, bookstore chains, pharmacies, home improvement stores, electronics and camera shops, catalog stores, and more: all went the way of the horse and buggy.
At the start of 2017, Walmart had 5,332 stores in the US.
It is headquartered in Bentonville, Arkansas, where it employs more than 18,000 workers.
Clearly, trade protection does not help if Detroit is competing with Blue Springs, Mississippi.
Nor do import tariffs help those left unemployed by the bankruptcy of Blockbuster Video, Borders Books, CompUSA, Circuit City, Payless, or Virgin Megastores. In the meantime, employment at Amazon grew by 47% over the past year, to 341,000 people.
But with Amazon employment concentrated in California, Texas, and Washington, the geography of those jobs is very different from that of those it is replacing.
As with the geographic relocation of US manufacturing jobs, TAA is not a solution for this kind of ailment.
After all, whereas TAA targets individuals directly impacted by foreign competition, much of the competition faced by local economies is not coming from abroad, and many of the jobs being lost are not in the industries directly affected by outside competition, but in the surrounding economy.
Facilitating individuals’ relocation does nothing for those left behind in shrinking towns.
With industry after industry disrupted by technological change, much of this pain is hard to avoid.
But interventions at the individual level must be complemented with assistance at the level of local economies.
The goal should be clear: as a town’s “export” industries are disrupted, new “export” activities must take their place, lest the town shrink and become impoverished.
This highlights the need for what UK Prime Minister Theresa May has called a Modern Industrial Strategy, aimed at “delivering jobs and economic growth to every community and corner of the country” to “ensure [that] free trade and globalization work for all.”
To achieve this, a new set of place-based policies will be needed.
The point is not to prop up dying industries, but to increase the birth rate and reduce the infant-mortality rate of firms in industries that can take their place, especially those that can sell to “outsiders,” reconnecting each location with external and increasingly global markets.
In their recent book The Smartest Places on Earth, Antoine van Agtmael and Fred Bakker document how this is already happening in parts of the US Rust Belt, where many towns – such as Akron, Ohio, or Albany, New York – have reinvented themselves.
These places are not only recovering; we know from how they voted last November that they are also not buying into Trump’s wall-building agenda.
Is Another Debt Crisis On the Way?
WASHINGTON, DC – Economic growth is accelerating across most of the world.
Yet the world’s total gross debt-to-GDP ratio has reached nearly 250%, up from 210% before the global economic crisis nearly a decade ago, despite post-crisis efforts by regulators in many important economies to drive the banking sector to deleverage.
This has raised doubts about the sustainability of the recovery, with some arguing that a rise in interest rates could trigger another global crisis.
But how likely is that to happen?
To answer this question, one must recall that debt is both a liability and an asset.
In a closed economy – and we don’t owe anything to non-Earthlings – overall debt and the corresponding assets necessarily cancel each other out.
So what really matters is the composition of debts and liabilities – or, to put it simply, who owes what to whom.
High public-sector debt, for example, signals the possible need for tax increases – the opposite of the tax legislation being advanced by Republican legislators in the United States – and/or higher interest rates (real or nominal, depending on monetary policy and inflation).
If debt is owed largely to foreign lenders, interest-rate risk is compounded by exchange-rate risk.
For private-sector debt, much depends on its type: the hedging sort, where a debtor’s cash flow covers all obligations; the speculative type, where cash flow covers interest only; or the Ponzi kind, where cash flow does not even cover that.
As the late American economist Hyman Minsky explained, the higher the share of debt that falls into the speculative or Ponzi categories, the higher the risk that a confidence shock will trigger a sudden wave of deleveraging that quickly morphs into a full-blown financial crisis.
For both public- and private-sector debt, maturities also play an important role.
Longer maturities leave more time for adjustment, lowering the risk of a confidence shock.
Yet while it makes little sense to focus on simple aggregate figures, both public institutions and private researchers tend to do precisely that.
Consider the coverage of the Greek debt crisis. Headlines tracked the debt-to-GDP ratio’s climb from 100% in 2007 to 180% this year, yet little attention was paid to private-sector debt.
And, in fact, as foreign public creditors replaced private debt holders and interest rates were lowered, Greece’s overall debt, while still high, became more sustainable.
Its continued sustainability will depend partly on the trajectory of Greece’s GDP – the denominator in the debt ratio.
A similar mistake is made in assessing China’s debts, about which the world is most concerned.
The figures are certainly daunting: China’s debt-to-GDP ratio now stands at about 250%, with private-sector debt amounting to about 210% of GDP.
But about two-thirds of the private-sector debt that is defined as bank loans and corporate bonds is actually held by state-owned enterprises and local-government entities. The central government has considerable control over both.
For China, the biggest risk probably lies in the shadow banking sector, on which reliable data are not available.
On the other hand, a significant share of the growth in private debt ratios in recent years may be a result of the “formalization” of parts of the shadow banking system – a trend that would bode well for economic stability.
And there is more good news for China.
Most Chinese debt is held in renminbi; the country possesses massive foreign-exchange reserves of close to $3 trillion; and capital controls are still effective, despite having been eased in recent years.
The country’s leaders thus have a public-policy war chest that they can use to cushion against financial turmoil.
Among the rest of the emerging economies, there are some sources of concern. But, overall, the situation is relatively stable.
Though private-sector debt has lately been rising, its levels remain tolerable. And public-sector debt has been growing only moderately, relative to GDP.
As for the advanced economies, there is little reason to believe that a debt crisis is around the corner in Japan.
In the US, public debt is set to increase, thanks to the impending tax overhaul; but the blow will be cushioned, at least for the next year or two, by continued growth acceleration.
And though low-quality assets held by the banking system are likely to impede Europe’s recovery, they are unlikely to spark a financial crisis.
In short, the world does not seem to face much risk of a debt crisis in the short term.
On the contrary, the stage seems to be set for continued increases in asset valuations and demand-driven growth.
That said, geopolitical risks should not be discounted.
While markets tend to shrug off localized political crises and even larger geopolitical challenges, some dramas may be set to spin out of control.
In particular, the North Korean nuclear threat remains acute, with the possibility of a sudden escalation raising the risk of conflict between the US and China.
The Middle East remains another source of serious instability, with tensions in the Gulf having intensified to the point that hostilities between Iran and Saudi Arabia and/or turmoil within Saudi Arabia are not unthinkable.
In this case, it is Russia that might end up clashing with the US.
Even barring such a major geopolitical upheaval, which would severely damage the global economy’s prospects in the short run, serious medium- and long-term risks loom.
Rising income inequality, exacerbated by the mismatch between skills and jobs in the digital age, will impede growth, unless a wide array of difficult structural reforms are implemented, including reforms aimed at constraining climate change.
As long as the geopolitical situation remains manageable, policymakers should have time to implement the needed structural reforms.
But the window of opportunity will not stay open forever.
If policymakers waste time on trickle-down sophistry, as is happening in the US, the world may be headed for severe economic distress.
Why Low Inflation Is No Surprise
BERKELEY – The fact that inflation has remained stubbornly low across the global North has come as a surprise to many economic observers.
In September, the always sharp and thoughtful Nouriel Roubini of New York University attributed this trend to positive shocks to aggregate supply – meaning the supply of certain goods has increased, driving down prices.
As a result, Roubini observed, “core inflation has fallen” even though the “recent growth acceleration in the advanced economies would be expected to bring with it a pickup in inflation.”
Meanwhile, the US Federal Reserve “has justified its decision to start normalizing rates, despite below-target core inflation, by arguing that the inflation-weakening supply-side shocks are temporary.”
Roubini concludes that, “even though central banks aren’t willing to give up on their formal 2% inflation target, they are willing to prolong the timeline for achieving it.”
In my view, interpreting today’s low inflation as a symptom of temporary supply-side shocks will most likely prove to be a mistake.
This diagnosis seems to misread the historical evidence from the period between the early 1970s and the late 1990s, and is thus based on a fundamentally flawed assumption about the primary driver of inflation in the global North since World War II.
Since the 1970s, economists have maintained a near-consensus belief that the Phillips curve has a substantial slope, meaning that prices react strongly to changes in demand.
According to this view, relatively small increases in aggregate demand above levels consistent with full employment will have a substantial impact not just on inflation, but also on expectations of inflation.
A period of rapidly accelerating inflation in the recent past will lead people to believe that inflation will increase in the future, too.
More than 20 years ago, I wrote a paper called “America’s Only Peacetime Inflation: The 1970s,” in which I challenged this narrative.
I showed that, when the now-standard view about inflation was developed in the 1970s, increases in aggregate demand above levels consistent with full employment were actually few, short-lived, and small, and that past inflation jumps had been incorporated into future expectations not rapidly, but slowly over time.
In fact, it took three large adverse supply shocks for expectations to adjust.
In addition to the Yom Kippur War of 1973 and the Iranian Revolution of 1979, productivity growth began to slow at the same time that unions still had substantial pricing power, and previously negotiated wage increases were already locked into many workers’ contracts.
Despite these shocks, central bankers, chiefly then-Fed Chair Arthur F. Burns, were hesitant to commit to achieving price stability.
Instead, Burns, understandably worried that fighting inflation would bring a deep recession, decided to kick the can down the road.
And as we now know, that set the stage for 1979, when Paul Volcker succeeded Burns as Fed Chair, hiked up the federal funds rate (a move now known as the “Volcker disinflation”), and brought on the Near-Great Recession of 1979-1982.
Strangely, this history of what actually happened was for some reason swallowed up by an alternative narrative that many still cling to today.
According to this pseudo-historical retelling, Keynesian economists in the 1960s did not understand the natural rate of unemployment, so they persuaded central bankers and governments to run overly expansionary policies that pushed aggregate demand above levels consistent with full employment.
This was of course an affront to the gods of the market, who responded by meting out divine retribution in the form of high and persistent inflation.
The Volcker disinflation was thus an act of penance.
To expunge the original sin, millions of workers’ jobs and incomes had to be sacrificed.
The clear lesson from this telling is that economists and central bankers must never again be allowed to run overly expansionary policies.
But that is obviously bad policy advice.
After all, it has been more than 20 years since economists Douglas Staiger, James H. Stock, and Mark W. Watson showed that the natural rate of unemployment is not a stable parameter that can be estimated precisely.
And economists Olivier Blanchard, Eugenio Cerutti, and Lawrence H. Summers have toppled the belief that the Phillips curve has a substantial slope.
In fact, to say that it had a substantial slope even in the 1970s requires one to avert one’s eyes from the supply shocks of that decade, and attribute to demand outcomes that are more plausibly attributed to supply.
Those who have used the prevailing economic fable about the 1970s to predict upward outbreaks of inflation in the 1990s, the 2000s, and now the 2010s have all been proven wrong.
Why, then, does the narrative still have such a hold on us today?
The best – albeit inadequate and highly tentative – explanation that I have heard is that it fits with our cognitive biases, because it tells us what we want to hear.
It seems to be in our nature to look for stories about sin and retribution, crime and punishment, error and comeuppance.
Finding out why we have this cognitive bias will no doubt launch many careers in psychology in the future.
In the meantime, we should free ourselves from a heuristic prison of our own making.
Nothing Natural About the Natural Rate of Unemployment
NEW YORK – Why is unemployment so low in countries where inflation remains subdued?
For economists, this is a fundamental question.
And when economists confront a fundamental question, fundamental disagreement often follows.
I was one of the rebel economists of the 1960s who rejected the macroeconomics we were taught in the 1950s – the “Keynesian” theory developed by J.R. Hicks, A.W. Phillips and James Tobin, according to which aggregate demand drove everything.
High unemployment was caused only by deficient demand, and low unemployment only by abnormally high demand.
This bothered us, because the basic economic theory we were taught – the theory built by Alfred Marshall, Knut Wicksell, and Robert Solow – said everything was driven by structural forces.
Faster technological progress and a greater preference to work or to save were to be welcomed, because they would boost the supply of labor and capital – and thus employment and investment.
But the Keynesians maintained that structural forces were bad, because they cost people their jobs, unless policymakers manufactured enough demand to match the increase in supply.
A conclusion we drew was that, at the very least, the path of an economy, measured by conventional macroeconomic variables of unemployment, inflation, and output growth, is not fully determined by aggregate demand.
Structural forces matter.
Keynesians’ claim that “demand” is all-powerful – that it alone increases employment and thus investment and even growth – was groundless.
Yet they continue to repeat it.
The structuralist perspective on macroeconomic behavior led to the concept that came to be called the “natural” rate of unemployment, borrowing from the notion, which arose in Europe during the interwar years, of a “natural” interest rate.
Yet the term “natural” was misleading.
The basic idea of the structuralist approach is that while market forces are always fluctuating, the unemployment rate actually has a homing tendency.
If it is, say, below its “natural” level, it will rise toward this level – and the rate of inflation will pick up.
(Of course, a fresh shock to demand could send unemployment back up and reduce inflation; but the “natural rate” always exerts its centripetal force.)
But there is a complication I have long emphasized.
The “natural rate” itself may be pushed up or pulled down by structural shifts.
Moreover, shifts in human attitudes and norms may also have an impact.
Yet a curious development has posed a challenge to this view.
America and the eurozone are in the midst of a boom.
In America, unemployment has reached very low levels and shows no sign of rising back to its former natural rate – whatever its new level may be.
With no more evidence than that, a structuralist model would predict an inflation rate that is already elevated and rising – and the inflation rate is not running high, even though the US Federal Reserve has flooded the economy with liquidity.
In the eurozone, too, unemployment is falling, yet inflation rates are still low there, too.
What explains the paradox of low unemployment despite low inflation (or vice versa)?
So far, economists – structuralists as well as diehard Keynesians – have been stumped.
The answer must be that the “natural rate” is not a constant of nature, like the speed of light.
Certainly, it could be moved by structural forces, whether technological or demographic.
It is possible, for example, that demographic trends are slowing wage growth and reducing the natural rate.
From the 1970s to the late 2000s, demography was essentially a dormant issue.
Now, the baby boomers are retiring from relatively high-wage jobs while young people, who start at relatively low wages, are still pouring in to the labor market.
This slows the growth of wage rates at a given unemployment rate, leading to lower unemployment at a given rate of wage growth.
More interesting is the possible effect of people’s values and attitudes, and their hopes and fears about the unknown and unknowable, on the natural rate.
Here we are entering terra incognita.
For me, a compelling hypothesis is that workers, shaken by the 2008 financial crisis and the deep recession that resulted, have grown afraid to demand promotions or to search for better-paying employers – despite the ease of finding work in the recently tight labor market.
A corollary hypothesis is that employers, disturbed by the extremely slow growth of productivity, especially in the past ten years, have grown leery of granting pay raises – despite the return of demand to pre-crisis proportions.
I have also argued, based on a model of mine, that as the return of a strong dollar by early 2015 threatened to inundate American markets with imports, firms became scared to supply more output at the same price.
Or else they supplied the same output as before at reduced prices.
And they refused to raise employees’ wages.
In short, more competition created “super-employment” – low unemployment and low inflation.
All this does not mean there is no natural unemployment rate, only that there is nothing natural about it. There never was.
The People’s Corporations
LONDON – Two big power shifts are occurring around the world today.
First, corporate power is growing relative to that of governments.
Second, ordinary people are also gaining greater influence.
What does it mean that these seemingly contradictory shifts are happening simultaneously?
There is, no doubt, more power in the hands of companies than ever before.
People who have not been popularly elected control more and more of our daily lives – from entertainment and energy supplies to schools, railways, and postal services.
At the same time, the speed of technological innovation is outpacing that of legislation, meaning that corporate activities are routinely entering seemingly gray areas devoid of regulation.
But, counterbalancing this trend, people now have the means and opportunities to ensure that companies’ behavior does not go unchecked.
They are becoming more educated and aware of how companies operate, and they are more proactive and outspoken when they believe a company has crossed the line.
The public increasingly acts as the conscience of companies and industries, asking hard questions and holding them to account.
In the past several years, more effective means of collective action – such as social media, open publishing platforms, and online video sharing – have given people more levers to pull.
As people pursue boycotts and disinvestment, lobby for legislation, and activate social-media campaigns with growing sophistication, they are increasingly able to influence companies’ operational and strategic decision-making, thereby imposing checks and balances on today’s enormous accretions of private power.
For some companies, this has come as a thunderbolt.
Consider the British Petroleum oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010.
The BP spill was one of the first instances in which companies were forced to contend with the power of social media – and in which people realized the potential of the tools at their disposal.
Like most companies at the time, BP was accustomed to communicating with traditional seats of power – the White House, the Kremlin, and so on – and to doing so via traditional modes of communication, such as briefing carefully selected journalists and distributing precisely worded press releases.
The Gulf oil spill changed all of that.
Communities united around an issue and found a voice on Facebook.
There was a massive conversation going on, and BP was neither a part of it nor able to control it via traditional communication-management methods.
Since then, there has been a marked increase in this sort of direct action.
Social media spread ideas in an immediate and unfettered manner.
A document, an image, or a video is shared, and suddenly what was secret or shielded is globally exposed.
And, though wrong or false information spreads just as quickly as true information, corrections are often swift as well.
For younger people today, using social media as a tool for activism is second nature.
They are fluent in using YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, and Reddit to communicate and create a community around an idea, issue, or objection – and to nurture the growth of a small group into a mass movement.
And older people are not far behind.
As corporate power rises, holding companies to account becomes increasingly important.
The scope of accountability must expand as well, in order to affect the behavior of executives and non-executives alike.
And companies’ board members will be increasingly held to account for how well they hold senior management to account.
With all of that comes a culture of questioning that which was previously unquestioned – including how companies are run and whether an organization’s actions are ethical.
Any action can be questioned by anyone, and if others find it interesting or important, the question will spread – and not just within a small community or a specialist group, but more broadly and around the world.
This shift has changed the nature of activism and collective action.
It has also made for new kinds of allies, with activist investors like Carl Icahn tweeting their intentions and markets responding.
Likewise, those who in other circumstances might see activist investors as natural adversaries can agree with the positions that they take, such as concerns about executive compensation or corporate social responsibility.
Activist investors can write open letters that may not be picked up by mainstream media outlets, but that can go viral on Twitter or Reddit.
This is often enough to make boards and executive committees sit up and take notice.
Corporate leaders who embrace this new reality, view it as an opportunity, and resist the inclination to “manage” or avoid issues will have a competitive advantage.
They will not regard meeting people where they are as a way to manipulate them, but as an opportunity to hear what they are saying.
Their first impulse will not be to figure out how to use modern means of direct communication to persuade customers, employees, and other stakeholders to think and do the things that they want them to think and do.
Instead, they will make real changes – and they will be better off for it.
Companies make our cars, our phones, and our children’s textbooks – and exercise increasing control over the daily lives and destinies of people worldwide, not only those who use their products, but also those who work for them and those who live in the communities where they are based.
If companies do not take seriously the responsibility that comes with their great and growing power, people will be there to remind them.
The Blatterball Diaries
LONDON – The World Cup has concluded with its usual flourish, and much of the world, as usual, couldn’t help but get caught up in the excitement of it all – which is exactly the outcome that Sepp Blatter wants.
Blatter, the president of FIFA, the Cup’s organizing body, wants the afterglow of an exciting month of play to blot out the corruption and backroom deals – and, most recently, a ticket scandal – that have roiled his tenure.
Times were very different in 1998, when Blatter took up his role.
Social media did not exist, and the Internet had not yet become a means of spreading the views of the voiceless and disenfranchised.
Nor was the culture of shareholder activism and corporate social responsibility as strong as it is today.
As BP, GM, and Royal Bank of Scotland have discovered, the world is watching, talking, and no longer willing to accept the old way of conducting business.
FIFA has two problems.
One is a straightforward lack of compliance with accepted business practices.
Allegations of wrongdoing range from match-fixing and bribery among members of FIFA’s Executive Committee to questions about how Qatar was chosen to host the World Cup in 2022.
The second problem is arguably more serious, for it is epiphenomenal: the damage that unethical behavior has done to the ideal of fair play.
When people see an institution that relates to something that they feel passionate about failing so publicly to abide by simple rules, they lose faith not only in that institution, but also in the idea that good governance is achievable at all.
The message sent, and understood, is that some institutions – of all kinds – are immune from scrutiny and can play by their own rules.
The code of conduct on the field – where we expect players to give their all under clear rules that are swiftly enforced by independent referees – is fundamentally the same as what we expect from governing bodies off the field.
In this sense, FIFA is not a special case: All non-profit and for-profit organizations around the world are expected to abide by this code of conduct.
And that is why FIFA’s problems are unlikely to fade from view.
They must be addressed head-on, with a clean sweep of its leadership and a complete overhaul of its governance structures.
FIFA is as complex as any large multinational private or public organization; how it is governed must reflect that.
For starters, FIFA must introduce truly independent board members to the governance process – people who will ask hard questions and challenge the organization’s executives.
Governance solely by association members has not worked – and, by encouraging a lack of transparency, may have made FIFA more vulnerable to the problems it now faces.
No organization that holds so much public influence and importance should be able to operate as a black box.
Likewise, FIFA must introduce and adhere to clearer term limits for its president and board members, starting with Blatter – and with immediate effect.
More effective checks and balances will not come easily; but they will not come at all without champions.
Before the World Cup began, some representatives of FIFA member associations spoke up in opposition to the status quo.
It will now be seen whether their actions reflect their words.
There are other glimmers of hope.
In the world of for-profit companies, investors are increasingly demanding better corporate-governance standards and more diverse boards that include independent members.
They are taking a much more active and public role in speaking out against bribery, corruption, and excessive pay packages, and in favor of corporate social responsibility and fair labor practices.
If their calls go unheeded, they vote at the annual general meeting – or with their feet.
FIFA’s sponsors must hold FIFA similarly to account, and there are signs that some are finally beginning – albeit tentatively – to speak out.
If they don’t, sponsors will leave themselves exposed to a consumer backlash as FIFA’s poor reputation rubs off on their brands.
Customers are savvier than ever before, and they, too, can vote with their feet.
Ultimately, however, change starts at the top.
Consider what a change in leadership has done for the Roman Catholic Church: Pope Francis is transforming an institution that was thought to be so byzantine, opaque, and intractable that change was all but impossible.
If the Catholic Church can change, so can the church of football.
There is another lesson here: good leadership also consists in knowing when to step down.
If Blatter genuinely cares about FIFA, he knows that remaining there would mean dragging the organization further into disrepute, damaging whatever positive contributions he has made, and quite possibly being forced to leave under a cloud.
The caption to a picture of Blatter on page six of FIFA’s 2013 financial report reads: “We have reached very high levels of accountability, transparency, and financial control.”
The problem is that no one believes it.
FIFA desperately needs to restore its public credibility. That can happen only after the necessary changes at the top and throughout the organization have been achieved.
Right, Left, and Macron
PARIS – French President Emmanuel Macron, once viewed as the quintessential centrist, has lately been labeled a right-wing politician.
He has, after all, eliminated the wealth tax, introduced greater labor-market flexibility, cut housing benefits, and introduced reforms to higher education – policies that a majority of right-wing voters embrace.
But things aren’t quite that cut and dried.
The right-left divide remains deeply felt in France.
The right has traditionally emphasized freedom – breaking down barriers that impede individuals’ ability to create.
The left has focused on equality, pursuing policies that aim to create a level playing field through redistribution.
This division remains particularly acute in economic and social policy, though it also extends to other areas, like education policy (for example, extended education versus early specialization).
Yet the truth is that the fundamentally redistributive nature of the French state has narrowed the gap between the two sides considerably in recent decades.
At the same time, divergences within the two main camps have grown, making it much more difficult to distinguish clearly two opposing perspectives.
For example, the far-right National Front denounces “handouts,” as is typical of the right, and yet embraces state-led redistribution.
That leftist demand, however, is mediated by the Front’s identity politics, particularly its vehement opposition to immigration.
Redistribution, in other words, is only for “us,” the “real” French people.
As for the left, it has not become fragmented so much as atomized.
There remains a clear distinction between the “governing left” and its “radical” counterpart.
Yet that divide runs even through the once-dominant Socialist Party.
The left is deeply divided on virtually all issues – Europe, secularism, education, business, and more – making it extremely difficult to identify what exactly constitutes “leftist” policies nowadays.
In fact, the Socialists have started distinguishing themselves not by what they are, but by what they are not, touting the line, “neither Macron nor Mélenchon” (a reference to the far-left Jean-Luc Mélenchon).
Yet that distinction may not be as powerful as the Socialists may believe.
After all, it was their center-left voters who got Macron elected.
And they knew what they were voting for: every policy he has implemented thus far was included in his campaign platform.
This suggests that France’s center-left largely accepts the current approach.
To be sure, Macron’s incentive-based economic policies are further to the right than anything France has known for a very long time.
And the center-right has, so far, backed every one of them.
(Macron’s cooptation of most of the center-right’s economic program has actually compounded the challenge it faces, leaving it with little choice but to use identity politics to stand out.)
At the same time, Macron’s social policies aim to produce roughly the same level of redistribution as before.
So, while his approach challenges the left’s political template, it comprises what are fundamentally center-left policies.
Of course, it will take some time for these policies’ effects to be felt.
But it will not be the poor who ultimately lose out; it will be the relatively affluent households that were not previously subject to the wealth tax.
The idea that eliminating a wealth tax can benefit an entire economy is difficult to defend.
The expectation that the benefits will “trickle down” to the middle and lower classes is highly dubious.
Yet, in a country where capitalism has historically been very weak, there is something to be said for the incentive-driven logic behind the move.
In an innovation-oriented economy that is now funded by capital rather than debt, the wealth tax had become a historical handicap, thwarting French industry and entrepreneurship.
The French model, which focuses on redressing excessive social inequalities through transfers, was built at a time when the number of losers was relatively small.
But, as the share of losers has grown alongside the emergence of a postindustrial economy, this model has reached its limits, with the growing amount of redistribution undermining economic efficiency.
What Macron is trying to do is update France’s economic operating system, shifting from the reparative approach of the past to a preparatory model that can better address the challenges generated by digital technology, globalization, and rapid innovation.
Far from ignoring inequalities, this approach aims to prevent them from taking hold.
The traditional redistributive logic will be abandoned in favor of a pre-distributive approach.
In practice, this means that unemployment would be addressed not by expanding the public-sector workforce, but by strengthening training via programs that reflect businesses’ real needs.
It means that educational inequalities would be reduced not simply by increasing resources, but with an interdisciplinary approach that balances early intervention to support the most vulnerable with greater institutional autonomy.
And it means that the health-care system’s quality will be improved not by throwing more money at it, but through a greater emphasis on preventive medicine.
Macron’s melding of the left and right has created something of an existential dilemma for France’s traditional political parties, which are now struggling for survival.
The 2019 European parliamentary elections may amount to a kind of reckoning.
But that isn’t the point.
At a time of deepening inequality, the primary challenge France faces is to shift its focus from damage control to damage prevention.
Macron’s policies will need to be assessed on the basis of that goal, not according to ideological labels that have lost significance.
Macron’s Challenge for Europe
PARIS – In an ambitious, visionary speech at the Sorbonne this week, French President Emmanuel Macron presented his plan for countering the tide of xenophobic nationalism in Europe.
He wants to build a “sovereign, united, and democratic Europe,” where citizens again feel a sense of allegiance to the idea of Europe itself.
Macron’s speech was a welcome call to arms for a European Union that is confronting many crises and threats.
But on the crucial and controversial question of fixing the eurozone, his proposals were disappointing.
And he will have a hard time winning over his more cautious European counterparts, not least German Chancellor Angela Merkel, whose room for maneuver was crimped by her party’s poor showing in last weekend’s federal election.
Still, Macron made a powerful, positive case for a renewed EU.
That EU embraces globalization and innovation, while also protecting Europeans, doing more to help them adapt to a changing world.
It advances European interests and values in a world otherwise dominated by America and China.
And it bolsters security at a time of increasing Russian revanchism, Islamist terrorism, and American disengagement under President Donald Trump.
Macron combined big ideas with many concrete proposals for closer cooperation on defense, migration, the environment, innovation, education, and much else.
Better still, he outlined a political strategy for seeing his proposals through.
Macron mused that, if he succeeds, a “Brexiting” Britain “may one day find its place again” in an overhauled EU, along with new members from the Western Balkans.
Under Macron’s plan, each EU member state would hold democratic conventions to debate citizens’ priorities.
Their ideas would feed into a broader process involving the EU institutions and governments that want to overhaul Europe.
Coalitions of willing governments would then integrate faster, with a revitalized Franco-German engine driving the process forward.
The ball is now in Germany’s court.
Europe could very well succumb to nationalism if Macron’s plan fails.
That would be devastating for Germany, a country whose economic success, political identity, and security are based on a strong, functioning EU.
Macron is the most pro-German French president imaginable, and he has boosted his credibility by pursuing difficult labor-market reforms and unveiling a Teutonically prudent budget.
Germany would be committing a monumental strategic blunder if it did not engage seriously with his proposals.
Unfortunately, Germany’s domestic politics just got trickier.
Macron had timed his speech to influence the post-election coalition negotiations there, with the hope that Merkel would use her fourth and likely final term to burnish her legacy by enacting bold European reforms.
Macron was also counting on Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union (CDU) to maintain its grand coalition with the Social Democrats (SPD) and their leader, former European Parliament President Martin Schulz.
But German voters had other plans.
The CDU and its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), lost support, and the SPD fared so poorly that it has decided to return to the opposition.
At the same time, the far-right, anti-EU Alternative for Germany (AfD) stormed into the Bundestag with 13% of the vote, and has pledged to “hunt” Merkel down.
Merkel, now politically weakened, must try to cobble together an unruly coalition that includes both the Europhile Greens, who welcomed Macron’s speech, and the Euroskeptic Free Democrats (FDP), who were hostile to it.
And while the AfD attacks her right flank, rivals within her own party will be jostling to succeed her.
Against this backdrop, even small compromises will be politically fraught.
Macron’s eurozone-reform plans will be the biggest bone of contention.
He wants to create a eurozone budget, funded by corporate-tax revenues.
The joint budget, which would make investments and provide a cushion during economic downturns, would be overseen by a eurozone finance minister, who would answer to eurozone countries’ representatives in the European Parliament.
But Germany is skeptical of what it sees as a “transfer union,” in which its taxpayers would hand over cash to profligate countries that have failed to remodel their economies along German lines.
Merkel would prefer a small common fund to help member-state governments enact difficult reforms, not a Keynesian fiscal stabilizer.
And while Macron envisions a finance minister who would be a political counterpart to European Central Bank President Mario Draghi, Merkel would prefer that the role be limited to enforcing national fiscal discipline.
The danger now is that Macron will achieve only a token eurozone budget in exchange for even tighter controls on national budgets, which would prove economically harmful and politically poisonous.
He would also miss his chance to enact the reforms that the eurozone actually needs.
These include deeper financial-market integration; an easier process for writing down bank and government debts; greater fiscal flexibility; and more balanced economic-adjustment mechanisms.
Macron’s most promising idea is to “give Europe back to its citizens.”
In my book European Spring, I argue that a flawed, technocratic EU needs bold leaders, political entrepreneurs, grassroots movements, and more experiments with deliberative democracy to deliver change. Macron has proposed all four.
Macron is right to point out that the EU bureaucracy often seems remote, uninspiring, and ineffectual; but he also rightly rejects referenda that polarize citizens over simplistic binary choices.
The big, open democratic conventions that he has proposed for the first half of 2018 could inject fresh ideas into a stale debate, provide legitimacy for bold reforms, and put pressure on recalcitrant governments.
Conventions could also foster new political movements like Macron’s own La République En Marche !, which could bring fresh faces into politics, help to open up closed, corrupt party systems, and start to rebuild the public’s trust in politicians.
They could also give Macron more leverage to push through his reforms, by running candidates in national and EU-wide elections.
Macron’s ambition is vast, if not overawing.
But so are Europe’s challenges.
Macron may be trying to achieve too much at once, but a more democratic, dynamic, and united EU is a prize worth fighting for.
Lessons from the Anti-Globalists
NEW YORK – The likely victory of Emmanuel Macron in the French presidential election has elicited a global sigh of relief.
At least Europe is not going down the protectionist path that President Donald Trump is forcing the United States to take.
But advocates of globalization should keep the champagne on ice: protectionists and advocates of “illiberal democracy” are on the rise in many other countries.
And the fact that an open bigot and habitual liar could get as many votes as Trump did in the US, and that the far-right Marine Le Pen will be in the run-off vote with Macron on May 7, should be deeply worrying.
Some assume that Trump’s poor management and obvious incompetence should be enough to dent enthusiasm for populist nostrums elsewhere.
Likewise, the US Rust Belt voters who supported Trump will almost certainly be worse off in four years, and rational voters surely will understand this.
But it would be a mistake to conclude that discontent with the global economy – at least how it treats large numbers of those in (or formerly in) the middle class – has crested.
If the developed liberal democracies maintain status quo policies, displaced workers will continue to be alienated.
Many will feel that at least Trump, Le Pen, and their ilk profess to feel their pain.
The idea that voters will turn against protectionism and populism of their own accord may be no more than cosmopolitan wishful thinking.
Advocates of liberal market economies need to grasp that many reforms and technological advances may leave some groups – possibly large groups – worse off.
In principle, these changes increase economic efficiency, enabling the winners to compensate the losers.
But if the losers remain worse off, why should they support globalization and pro-market policies?
Indeed, it is in their self-interest to turn to politicians who oppose these changes.
So the lesson should be obvious: In the absence of progressive policies, including strong social-welfare programs, job retraining, and other forms of assistance for individuals and communities left behind by globalization, Trumpian politicians may become a permanent feature of the landscape.
The costs imposed by such politicians are high for all of us, even if they do not fully achieve their protectionist and nativist ambitions, because they prey on fear, inflame bigotry, and thrive on a dangerously polarized us-versus-them approach to governance.
Trump has leveled his Twitter attacks against Mexico, China, Germany, Canada, and many others – and the list is sure to grow the longer he is in office.
Le Pen has targeted Muslims, but her recent comments denying French responsibility for rounding up Jews during World War II revealed her lingering anti-Semitism.
Deep and perhaps irreparable national cleavages may be the result.
In the US, Trump has already diminished respect for the presidency and will most likely leave behind a more divided country.
We must not forget that before the dawn of the Enlightenment, with its embrace of science and freedom, incomes and living standards were stagnant for centuries.
But Trump, Le Pen, and the other populists represent the antithesis of Enlightenment values.
Without blushing, Trump cites “alternative facts,” denies the scientific method, and proposes massive budget cuts for public research, including on climate change, which he believes is a hoax.
The protectionism advocated by Trump, Le Pen, and others poses a similar threat to the world economy.
For three-quarters of a century, there has been an attempt to create a rules-based global economic order, in which goods, services, people, and ideas could move more freely across borders.
To the applause from his fellow populists, Trump has thrown a hand grenade into that structure.
Given the insistence of Trump and his acolytes that borders do matter, businesses will think twice as they construct global supply chains.
The resulting uncertainty will discourage investment, especially cross-border investment, which will diminish the momentum for a global rules-based system.
With less invested in the system, advocates for such a system will have less incentive to push for it.
This will be troublesome for the entire world.
Like it or not, humanity will remain globally connected, facing common problems like climate change and the threat of terrorism.
The ability and incentive to work cooperatively to solve these problems must be strengthened, not weakened.
The lesson of all of this is something that Scandinavian countries learned long ago.
The region’s small countries understood that openness was the key to rapid economic growth and prosperity.
But if they were to remain open and democratic, their citizens had to be convinced that significant segments of society would not be left behind.
The welfare state thus became integral to the success of the Scandinavian countries.
They understood that the only sustainable prosperity is shared prosperity.
It is a lesson that the US and the rest of Europe must now learn.
Macron’s Labor Gambit
CAMBRIDGE –At the end of August, French president Emmanuel Macron unveiled the labor-market overhaul that will make or break his presidency – and may well determine the future of the eurozone.
His goal is to bring down France’s stubbornly high rate of unemployment, just a shade below 10%, and energize an economy that badly needs a kick-start.
Labor reform has long been on France’s agenda.
Practically every French administration in recent memory has tried to rewrite the country’s gargantuan labor code, typically failing in the face of trade union protests.
Macron makes no bones about what he is up against: he has described it as a Copernican revolution.
But this time may well be different.
Even though the country’s second-largest union has called a general strike, indications are that Macron will have the political support he needs.
Macron’s reforms aim at increasing what is euphemistically called labor-market flexibility.
The proposed reforms would make it easier for firms to dismiss employees, decentralize bargaining between employers and workers in small firms (by eliminating sector-level agreements), and introduce a ceiling on indemnity for wrongful dismissal, providing firms relief from the unpredictability of damages awarded through arbitration.
Moreover, the reforms remove a requirement that linked mass layoffs at large companies to such firms’ global profitability; companies will now be permitted to fire workers solely on the basis of domestic profitability.
The logic behind Macron’s labor-market reforms has driven the structural-reform agenda of policy economists and international institutions ranging from the International Monetary Fund to the OECD during the last three decades.
Greater flexibility, according to this view, will enable French firms to adjust more efficiently to changing market conditions, which in turn will make them more competitive and dynamic, giving the French economy a boost.
The idea that making it easier to fire workers will reduce, rather than increase, unemployment is not as crazy as it may sound.
If the costs of firing workers are prohibitively high, firms may not hire additional workers in a market upturn, for fear that they will be unable to reduce their labor costs in a future downturn.
Firing costs are hiring costs, as economists like to say.
Reduce firing costs, and you reduce hiring costs, too.
Whether a reduction in firing costs does boost employment depends on the balance of those two offsetting factors.
The outcome turns on whether firms are more constrained by the hiring costs or by the firing costs.
In good times, when firms want to expand, it is the hiring costs that bind, and making it easier to fire workers will remove a key impediment to investment and capacity expansion.
In more pessimistic times, reducing firing costs will simply lead to more dismissals.
Which of these factors prevails depends on the state of aggregate demand and the “animal spirits” of employers.
This ambiguity explains why it has proved difficult to establish a clear empirical relationship between employment protection and labor-market performance, despite the enthusiasm of many economists and policymakers for flexibility-enhancing reforms.
There is considerable evidence that strong employment protection laws do reduce job turnover – the number of hires and fires.
But when it comes to overall employment and unemployment levels, “the jury is still out,” as a recent survey shows.
The comparative record gives us little confidence that the French reforms will produce a boost in employment.
France is thought to have particularly cumbersome labor laws.
Yet many of the economies with which it competes have similarly strong labor-market protections.
In fact, according to the OECD’s indicators of employment protection, German and Dutch workers under permanent contracts enjoy even greater security than French workers do.
(Where the French system seems especially restrictive is with respect to temporary contracts.)
By some measures, France was second only to Germany in terms of labor-market deregulation before the global financial crisis.
Yet unemployment levels in Germany and the Netherlands are a fraction of those prevailing in France.
The real difference between these economies is that Germany and the Netherlands, unlike France, run large current-account surpluses.
This means that their economies receive a large boost from foreign demand.
France, by contrast, has a small current-account deficit.
Might reforms that increase labor-market flexibility give French industry a similar lift?
Perhaps.
But that will require a sharp increase in French industrialists’ animal spirits.
Psychology may eventually play a greater role than the details of the reforms themselves.
In such a technocratic discussion, it is easy to forget that what economists call “labor-market rigidities” are in fact a crucial component of the social bargain in advanced capitalist economies.
They provide income and employment security for workers whose lives might otherwise be subject to tumultuous upheavals.
And, as the Italian economist Giuseppe Bertola notes, they can be efficient even from a strictly economic perspective, because they facilitate the smoothing of labor incomes.
Macron’s entourage has been wisely telling anyone who will listen not to expect too much from the new labor code.
The economics of the reforms suggest that they are unlikely to make a big difference on their own.
The trouble is that Macron has too few arrows in his quiver when it comes to lifting French economic growth.
In terms of macroeconomic policy, his hands are tied in the eurozone, and there is little prospect that Germany will help by boosting its investment and spending.
So, whether Macron likes it or not, his presidency is likely to be judged by the economic and political repercussions of his labor reforms.
Is the Shine Off Macron?
GENEVA – Emmanuel Macron is on a winning streak.
Within a year, he has gone from inexperienced political underdog, with no establishment backing, to President of the French Republic and leader of a newly created political party with an impressive parliamentary majority.
Can he keep it up?
Macron owes his recent success not just to good luck, but also to his ability to build on any break that came his way.
For voters who were feeling mistrustful of the political establishment, he managed to provide an appealing option that did not require a move to the fringes, whether right or left.
He came to be seen as a smart disruptor of the disruptive populists.
Macron’s economic program was particularly clever, as it responded impeccably to more than a decade of analyses of the ills afflicting the French economy.
He committed to freeing up the famously ossified labor market and alleviating an excessive and entrepreneurship-stifling tax burden.
He also pledged to shrink France’s unwieldy state, which now spends 57% of GDP per year, by reducing cumbersome regulations and rationalizing the outdated welfare system.
After his election, Macron upheld his reputation as a breath of fresh air, building a government composed of young people from all walks of life – inexperienced, maybe, but enthusiastic and smart.
Those who had long lamented France’s economic decline could not believe the miracle taking shape before their eyes.
But great expectations can herald great disappointment.
And early signals from the Macron administration are disquieting.
While the promised labor-market reform is well underway, and could be adopted as early as September, the administration’s macroeconomic program, articulated by Prime Minister Édouard Philippe, is a serious disappointment.
Philippe has announced that he plans to cut public spending by a mere three percentage points of GDP over five years.
He has postponed several clever pro-growth tax cuts, some until the end of Macron’s current term of office in 2022. A couple of days later, Macron changed tack and brought some of these cuts a bit forward.
Yet he intends to carry out in 2018 a general tax increase that was presented as a partial offset to the cuts.
In defense of this approach, Philippe cites the official national-accounts watchdog, the Cour des Comptes, which has reported serious budget overruns for 2017 – a result of disingenuous electoral promises by the departing president, François Hollande.
The newcomers must therefore bring the deficit back down to 3% of GDP, as promised last year to France’s European partners.
It is, Philippe insists, a matter of credibility.
But pleasing the bean counters in Brussels or Berlin threatens to undermine France’s incipient economic recovery – and, in turn, support for the country’s new president – at a moment when important and, at times, unpopular reforms must be pushed through.
(As it stands, per capita GDP is now only slightly above its pre-crisis level, and unemployment began a slow decline just last year.)
European leaders would probably prefer a little deficit slippage to the loss of popular support for France’s pro-Europe president, provided public spending is reduced.
Macron must understand all of this.
So why he is taking such a macroeconomic risk?
And, perhaps more important, is this indicative of what the rest of his presidency will look like?
The most positive interpretation assumes that Macron has decided to focus on deep and courageous reforms, while approaching macroeconomic issues with caution, much like his predecessors, Nicolas Sarkozy and Hollande.
Both initially rejected austerity only to end up adopting it.
But Sarkozy and Hollande saw their public opinion ratings drop precipitously after their embrace of austerity.
Does Macron think that his luck will continue, bringing, say, a stronger economic recovery than currently foreseen?
Or does he simply believe that he is in a stronger position to survive disappointing growth and unemployment outcomes than his predecessors?
In other words, is Macron being driven by faith or hubris?
The most disquieting interpretation of Macron’s decision-making is that he is already captured by his own administration.
Top French civil servants of the kind that he has assembled traditionally share two characteristics: they are overly cautious and they have a poor understanding of macroeconomic strategy.
Given this, it seems likely that many in Macron’s administration take the European agreements very seriously, even too seriously, and are repelled by the idea of vigorous spending cuts, because their power is related to the size of the purse they control.
If this reading is correct, the French government will remain top-heavy, and the tax burden will remain suffocating.
But there is a third possibility: Macron believes that, to advance his vision for the European Union, he must act impeccably on the European stage, meeting the most stringent German standards.
That approach would be reasonable if Macron really had a new vision for the EU.
During the electoral campaign, he mostly just rehashed the traditional French view: a common European government and a eurozone finance minister, with a separate budget to finance public investment.
Most other EU countries have already rejected that vision, and many believe that not even France itself would agree to the transfers of sovereignty that such reforms would imply.
In any case, the EU is not at the point where it can discuss such radical steps, as its top priority still must be to fix what is broken: a half-baked banking union, a non-functioning Stability and Growth Pact, excessive regulation, and an empty immigration policy.
Macron’s rapid ascent reflected his ability to say the right thing in the right circumstances.
But it also meant that he moved into the Élysée Palace without having shown who he really is.
One hopes that he turns out to be the man reflected in that well-thought-out economic program on which he campaigned, not the one reflected in his macroeconomic policies since taking power.
Can Europe Sustain the Macron Moment?
STOCKHOLM – At the start of 2017, many feared that the European project would experience a near-breakdown within the next year.
The United Kingdom had decided to leave the European Union, the United States had elected a president who cheered the Brexiteers on, and populists running in the French and German elections posed a clear danger to European integration.
As we approach the start of 2018, the picture is very different.
The European project has not only survived, but may be gaining new momentum.
At least within the bubble of EU institutions in Brussels, one senses a newfound confidence.
More than anyone else, French President Emmanuel Macron is at the center of this turnaround.
His post-election victory speech in May was accompanied by the EU anthem, Beethoven’s “Ode to Joy” – a strong symbolic gesture.
Since then, Macron has launched or proposed one initiative after another to strengthen EU institutions, while taking a lead in European foreign policy.
With German Chancellor Angela Merkel struggling to form a government after September’s general election, all eyes are now on Macron.
The changing mood in Europe over the past year has been influenced by three factors in particular.
The first is Brexit, which is undeniably causing problems for the British – and in turn causing most Europeans to begin to understand the extent to which their economies and societies are intertwined.
The once-glorious country of Great Britain is now in a state of political agony as it tries to sort out the politics, economics, and logistics of leaving the bloc.
It is unlikely that voters in any other member state will envy the British experience.
The second factor is Donald Trump, whose US administration has a lower standing in Europe than any other in recorded history.
According to one recent poll, Germans now regard Trump as a greater threat to their country’s interests abroad than Russian President Vladimir Putin or North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un.
In a true race to the bottom, Trump is ahead.
Over the past year, European leaders have accepted that Europe will have to take more responsibility for its own affairs.
After a vexing encounter with Trump at the G7 summit in Italy in May, Merkel summed up a sentiment that most other European leaders now share.
“We Europeans must fight for our own future and destiny,” she said in an unscripted outburst at a campaign stop.
“We Europeans truly have to take our fate into our own hands.”
The third factor is Putin’s Russia, which has continued to meddle in Western elections and act aggressively in Ukraine.
All told, the “BTP effect” – Brexit, Trump, Putin – has convinced even skeptical Europeans that EU-level cooperation is necessary.
But, in addition to the impetus of the BTP effect, Europe is being propelled by stronger economic growth.
The dark days of the euro crisis have begun to fade into memory, as has the refugee crisis of late 2015, which had a profound political effect on Germany, Sweden, and other countries.
Although the huge task of deepening EU integration remains unfinished, the political and economic conditions for seeing that process through have improved.
At the same time, the EU has suddenly emerged as the preserver of the liberal world order.
In September, the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) between the EU and Canada entered into force.
And, since then, the EU has moved closer to finalizing an even more important trade agreement with Japan, and, separately, with the founding countries of Mercosur – Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay.
Britain may be leaving, but the rest of the world seems to be lining up to make deals with the EU.
Still, there is no room for complacency.
Despite many positive developments, governance is becoming more complicated within certain European countries, owing to an increasingly fractured political landscape.
In Germany, forming a new government after an election used to be a straightforward affair.
But now the country could be under a caretaker government until March, with little clarity about what sort of government will emerge.
In the meantime, Germany can hardly play its customary role as Europe’s anchor of stability.
In the Danubian lands of Hungary, Austria, and Bavaria, nationalism is on the rise.
And in Italy, few would dare to offer any solid predictions of what will happen in the next general election, which must be held before May 20, 2018.
Moreover, Europeans cannot rely indefinitely on the low interest rates that have contributed to the current recovery.
EU leaders will need to push much harder for structural reforms than they have so far.
Although Spain has revived its economy with important reforms, and Macron has tackled France’s notoriously Byzantine labor code, the EU is still struggling on many fronts.
For example, despite Estonia’s heroic efforts to create a digital-reform agenda during its presidency of the Council of the EU, far more needs to be done in that area.
Next year will be the last chance to pursue EU-level reforms before a fateful year of reckoning begins.
In March 2019, Britain will leave the EU, with or without a divorce agreement.
Then, in May, come elections to the European Parliament, and new leaders will be appointed for the EU’s core institutions.
Before we know it, Jean-Claude Juncker’s presidency of the European Commission will be over.
Macron is anxiously awaiting a new government in Berlin.
As things stand, it is far from clear that the next German coalition will support his EU-reform agenda.
And, with each passing day, the European Commission will be running out of time to pursue any new initiatives that could realistically be finalized before 2019.
So, while the gloom and doom of 2016 may have receded, it could all too easily return.
Sustaining the momentum generated by Macron’s election in France and realizing the promise that it holds will require decisive action in the months ahead.
The Hunger Bonds
CAMBRIDGE – Investing often creates moral dilemmas over goals: Should we aim to do well or to do good?
Is it appropriate to invest in tobacco companies?
Or in companies that sell guns to drug gangs?
The recent popularity of so-called impact investment funds, which promise to deliver decent returns while advancing social or environmental goals, is based on this unease.
Foundations often find that these investment vehicles help them to do good both with the money that they spend on philanthropy and with the endowment assets that yield the returns on which their philanthropy depends.
Nowadays, it is emerging markets as an asset class that should make people morally queasy.
Should decent people put their money in emerging-market bond funds?
The returns of the JP Morgan Emerging Market Bond Index (EMBI+) are heavily influenced by what happens in Venezuela.
The reason is simple: while Venezuela represents only about 5% of the index, it accounts for about 20% of its yield, because the yield on Venezuelan debt is about five times larger than that of other countries in the index, a reflection of the huge risk premium that Venezuela faces.
Moreover, the price volatility of Venezuelan debt – the highest in the EMBI+ – accounts for a disproportionate share of the index’s daily price movements.
You might invest in the EMBI+ because it promises higher returns, or because you want to make your savings available to a larger segment of humanity.
But if you do, you will root for Venezuelan debt, which means wishing for really bad things to happen to Venezuela’s people.
As has been widely reported in the media, Venezuela is experiencing one of the most calamitous economic collapses ever, accompanied by massive doses of political repression and human-rights violations.
So investing in the EMBI+ means that you rejoice when Wall Street analysts inform you that the country is literally starving its people in order to avoid restructuring your bonds.
Your happiness is easily explained: Venezuelan imports, after having collapsed by 75% from 2012 to 2016, are down more than 20% in the first quarter of 2017.
That’s good news for you as an EMBI+ investor, because it means that more money is left to service your bonds. Meanwhile, Venezuelans are involuntarily losing weight and searching for food in garbage piles.
Sure, it’s a humanitarian catastrophe. But, to you, it’s a fabulous investment opportunity.
Now assume that you want to hold Venezuelan debt because you are hoping that President Nicolás Maduro will lose power and that a more sensible, democratically minded government, more in line with your moral compass, will emerge.
Even in that case, you will still want the gains from Venezuela’s future recovery to be used preferentially to service the old debt issued to finance the corruption and national destruction brought about by Maduro and his predecessor, Hugo Chávez.
You will not be rooting for the recovery of livelihoods that Venezuelans deserve after having lived through this nightmare.
You will also be rooting for US judges to seize assets and impound money to pay you.
In fact, analysts who are bullish on Venezuelan debt have been lobbying the government and opposition leaders with an implied threat: even considering a restructuring of your bonds, they point out, will allow those managing your assets to cause havoc in Venezuela.
If you are a decent human being, investing in Venezuelan bonds should make you feel “mildly nauseous,” to borrow a phrase recently used by former FBI Director James Comey while testifying to the US Congress.
Emerging-market fund managers feel a similar discomfort.
They currently spend a disproportionate share of their time “getting the Venezuelan call right,” because their bonuses are based on their over-performance relative to the index – of which Venezuela is the main driver.
The less morally burdened among them bask in the recognition they receive for having been right to predict that Maduro’s government would decide to starve its people rather than restructure the bonds you hold.
Analysts and bondholders have also lobbied the government and the opposition not to seek financial support from the International Monetary Fund, for fear that the international community will demand that you accept a significant “haircut” on your investment, as has been required of Greece’s creditors.
That would probably not be “good for the credit.”
Analysts and bondholders have also lobbied the opposition-controlled National Assembly to recognize Venezuela’s external debt in exchange for the freedom of political prisoners, implying that the payment of your bonds can be secured through ransom.
So, should you stop investing in emerging-market funds just because 5% of your savings would go toward financing Venezuela?
Clearly, this would punish other countries that are innocent bystanders in the Venezuelan mess.
There must be a better way.
There is.
The solution is to demand that JPMorgan immediately exclude Venezuela from the emerging market bond indexes it calculates, thereby freeing fund managers from the need to compare their performance with hunger bonds.
Over time, JPMorgan should introduce a Decent Emerging Markets index, which would save you from moral anguish by ensuring that only countries adhering to minimal standards of respect for their citizens are included.
The DEM would allow you to root for higher returns on your savings without wishing for human misery. You could do well, without feeling bad.
Making Globalization Work
I have written repeatedly about the problems of globalization: an unfair global trade regime that impedes development; an unstable global financial system that results in recurrent crises, with poor countries repeatedly finding themselves burdened with unsustainable debt; and a global intellectual property regime that denies access to affordable life-saving drugs, even as AIDS ravages the developing world.
I have also written about globalization’s anomalies: money should flow from rich to poor countries, but in recent years it has been going in the opposite direction.
While the rich are better able to bear the risks of currency and interest-rate fluctuations, it is the poor who bear the brunt of this volatility.
Indeed, I have complained so loudly and vociferously about the problems of globalization that many have wrongly concluded that I belong to the anti-globalization movement.
But I believe that globalization has enormous potential – as long as it is properly managed.
Some 70 years ago, during the Great Depression, John Maynard Keynes formulated his theory of unemployment, which described how government action could help restore full employment.
While conservatives vilified him, Keynes actually did more to save the capitalist system than all the pro-market financiers put together.
Had the conservatives been followed, the Great Depression would have been even worse and the demand for an alternative to capitalism would have grown stronger.
By the same token, unless we recognize and address the problems of globalization, it will be difficult to sustain.
Globalization is not inevitable: there have been setbacks before, and there can be setbacks again.
Globalization’s advocates are right that it has the potential to raise everyone’s living standards.
But it has not done that.
The questions posed by young French workers, who wonder how globalization will make them better off if it means accepting lower wages and weaker job protection, can no longer be ignored.
Nor can such questions be answered with the wistful hope that everyone will someday benefit.
As Keynes pointed out, in the long run, we are all dead.
Growing inequality in the advanced industrial countries was a long-predicted but seldom advertised consequence of globalization.
Full economic integration implies the equalization of unskilled wages everywhere in the world, and, though we are nowhere near attaining this “goal,” the downward pressure on those at the bottom is evident.
To the extent that changes in technology have contributed to the near stagnation of real wages for low-skilled workers in the United States and elsewhere for the past three decades, there is little that citizens can do.
But they can do something about globalization.
Economic theory does not say that everyone will win from globalization, but only that the net gains will be positive, and that the winners can therefore compensate the losers and still come out ahead.
But conservatives have argued that in order to remain competitive in a global world, taxes must be cut and the welfare state reduced.
This has been done in the US, where taxes have become less progressive, with tax cuts given to the winners – those who benefit from both globalization and technological changes.
As a result, the US and others following its example are becoming rich countries with poor people.
But the Scandinavian countries have shown that there is another way.
Of course, government, like the private sector, must strive for efficiency.
But investments in education and research, together with a strong social safety net, can lead to a more productive and competitive economy, with more security and higher living standards for all.
A strong safety net and an economy close to full employment provides a conducive environment for all stakeholders – workers, investors, and entrepreneurs – to engage in the risk-taking that new investments and firms require.
The problem is that economic globalization has outpaced the globalization of politics and mindsets.
We have become more interdependent, increasing the need to act together, but we do not have the institutional frameworks for doing this effectively and democratically.
Never has the need for international organizations like the IMF, the World Bank, and the World Trade Organization been greater, and seldom has confidence in these institutions been lower.
The world’s lone superpower, the US, has demonstrated its disdain for supranational institutions and worked assiduously to undermine them.
The looming failure of the Development Round of trade talks and the long delay in the United Nations Security Council’s demand for a ceasefire in Lebanon are but the latest examples of America’s contempt for multilateral initiatives.
Enhancing our understanding of globalization’s problems will help us to formulate remedies – some small, some large – aimed at both providing symptomatic relief and addressing the underlying causes.
There is a broad array of policies that can benefit people in both developing and developed countries, thereby providing globalization with the popular legitimacy that it currently lacks.
In other words, globalization can be changed; indeed, it is clear that it will be changed.
The question is whether change will be forced upon us by a crisis or result from careful, democratic deliberation and debate.
Crisis-driven change risks producing a backlash against globalization, or a haphazard reshaping of it, thus merely setting the stage for more problems later on.
By contrast, taking control of the process holds out the possibility of remaking globalization, so that it at last lives up to its potential and its promise: higher living standards for everyone in the world.
A Global Plan to End Malaria
ABU DHABI – No one should die from a preventable disease.
Yet preventable diseases kill two million children every year, many of whom are too poor to afford proper treatment.
The majority of these deaths are either treatable with existing medicines, or avoidable in the first place.
Malaria, a life-threatening disease transmitted by mosquitos, is one of these illnesses.
Less than a century ago, families everywhere – including across North America and Europe – lived in fear of a mosquito bite.
Malaria not only took the lives of children and adults; it perpetuated poverty and limited global economic growth, preventing millions from reaching their full potential.
Today, more than 30 countries have eliminated the malaria parasite, and at least ten more are on track to do so by 2020.
Despite this, malaria remains a leading cause of death for children under five in Sub-Saharan Africa, taking the life of a child every two minutes.
Malaria is also expensive, costing Africa’s economy some $12 billion per year.
Despite many decades of intense research and development efforts, with more than 20 possible vaccines currently being evaluated, there is still no commercially available inoculation against malaria.
However, there are a number of preventive measures that can contribute to reducing the risk of infection.
These include using insecticide-treated bed nets, spraying indoor walls with insecticides, and focusing prophylactic measures on the most vulnerable groups.
Today, we have a window of opportunity to build on what has already been accomplished, by highlighting and supporting initiatives and research efforts that could eradicate malaria.
For example, researchers at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health’s Malaria Research Institute have discovered how resistance to the malaria parasite can spread in a mosquito population.
The findings could pave the way for the development of self-propagating malaria-control strategies, mitigating the need for continuous application of insecticides and reliance on bed nets.
Another important initiative that deserves support is the World Health Organization’s “vector control” guidelines, which offer strategies for controlling the mosquitos, flies, and bugs that transmit disease.
The WHO’s plan provides a new strategy to strengthen vector control worldwide through increased capacity, improved surveillance, better coordination, and integrated action across sectors and diseases.
Global health efforts should support efforts by countries where malaria is endemic to develop and improve vector-control strategies.
We also need to consider how changing global environments are affecting the occurrence of malaria.
For example, because deforestation creates favorable conditions for mosquitos by producing ditches and puddles, which are more likely to pool less acidic water that is conducive to mosquito larvae development, countries with elevated forest loss tend to have higher rates of malaria.
Deforestation also leads to reduced absorption of rainfall, which increases the volume of standing water.
In the United Arab Emirates, we believe that eliminating disease is central to global development.
If people are given the opportunity to lead healthy lives, they can get an education, contribute to the economy, and look after their families, generating a multiplier effect that further boosts prosperity and development.
We also believe in adopting a holistic approach, one that includes securing financial commitments, promoting research and innovation through infrastructure development, and regularly convening global champions to maintain momentum and share ideas.
For disease eradication, partnership is essential.
That is why Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed, the Abu Dhabi Crown Prince, has contributed $30 million to the Roll Back Malaria partnership, the preeminent global framework for action against malaria.
I am proud to sit on the board of Roll Back Malaria, because I believe that diversity of leadership perspectives is vital to finding solutions to combat the disease, particularly as we begin a bold new chapter in the quest to eliminate it.
The landscape of leaders supporting global health is expanding, and now represents populations around the world.
This is important, because partnerships like Roll Back Malaria must work globally to save the greatest possible number of lives.
We hope to encourage further global collaboration this week, as Abu Dhabi convenes more than 200 leaders in disease eradication at a forum called Reaching the Last Mile.
This meeting aims to share insights and best practices on how to map, control, or eliminate preventable diseases, including innovations that could ultimately bring an end to malaria globally.
In the twentieth century, we managed to eradicate a disease, smallpox, for the first time in history.
Complete eradication, elimination, or control of disease is complex, and that is particularly true of malaria.
A few years ago, we thought that elimination of malaria was beyond our reach, but together the world has made tremendous progress.
Between 2000 and 2015, public-health interventions saved the lives of 6.2 million people, 5.9 million of whom were children under the age of five.
By 2020, an estimated $6.4 billion will be needed each year to fund the global fight to eliminate malaria.This will be a difficult feat, but together we can create a future without the disease – a brighter and more stable future for millions of vulnerable people, with more opportunities for generations to come.
Manchester’s Bright Future
MANCHESTER – I am a proud Mancunian (as the people of Manchester are known), despite the fact I haven’t lived here permanently since I left school for university when I was 18.
I was born in St. Mary’s hospital near the city center, was raised in a pleasant suburb in South Manchester, and attended a normal primary and junior school in a nearby, tougher neighborhood, before attending Burnage for secondary school.
Thirty-eight years after I attended Burnage, so too, apparently, did Salman Abedi, the suspected Manchester Arena bomber.
The atrocity carried out by Abedi, for which the Islamic State has claimed credit, is probably worse than the dreadful bombing by the Irish Republican Army that destroyed parts of the city center 21 years ago, an event that many believe played a key role in Manchester’s renaissance.
At least in that case, the bombers gave a 90-minute warning that helped avoid loss of life.
Abedi’s barbaric act, by contrast, killed at least 22 people, many of them children.
In recent years, I have been heavily involved in the policy aspects of this great city’s economic revival.
I chaired an economic advisory group to the Greater Manchester Council, and then served as Chair of the Cities Growth Commission, which advocated for the “Northern Powerhouse,” a program to link the cities of the British north into a cohesive economic unit.
Subsequently, I briefly joined David Cameron’s government, to help implement the early stages of the Northern Powerhouse.
I have never attended a concert at the Manchester Arena, but it appears to be a great venue for the city.
Just as Manchester Airport has emerged as a transport hub serving the Northern Powerhouse, the arena plays a similar role in terms of live entertainment.
As the sad reports about those affected indicate, attendees came from many parts of northern England (and beyond).
In the past couple of years, Manchester has received much praise for its economic revival, including its position at the geographic heart of the Northern Powerhouse, and I am sure this will continue.
Employment levels and the regional PMI business surveys indicate that, for most of the past two years, economic momentum has been stronger in North West England than in the country as a whole, including London.
Whether this is because of the Northern Powerhouse policy is difficult to infer; whatever the reason, it is hugely welcome and important to sustain.
To my occasional irritation, many people still wonder what exactly the Northern Powerhouse is.
At its core, it represents the economic geography that lies within Liverpool to the west, Sheffield to the East, and Leeds to the northeast, with Manchester in the middle.
The distance from Manchester to the center of any of those other cities is less than 40 miles (64 kilometers), which is shorter than the London Underground’s Central, Piccadilly, or District lines.
If the 7-8 million people who live in those cities – and in the numerous towns, villages, and other areas between them – can be connected via infrastructure, they can act as a single unit in terms of their roles as consumers and producers.
The Northern Powerhouse would then be a genuine structural game changer for Britain’s economy.
Indeed, along with London, it would be a second dynamic economic zone that registers on a global scale.
It is this simple premise that led the previous government to place my ideas at the core of its economic policies, and why the Northern Powerhouse has become so attractive to business here in the United Kingdom and overseas.
It is a thrilling prospect, and, despite being less than three years old, it is showing signs of progress.
In fact, given the broader economic benefits of agglomeration, the Northern Powerhouse mantra can be extended to the whole of the North of England, not least to include Hull and the North East.
But it is what I often inelegantly call “Man-Sheff-Leeds-Pool” that distinguishes the Northern Powerhouse, and Manchester, which sits at the heart of it, is certainly among the early beneficiaries.
Despite this, I have frequently said to local policy leaders, business people, those from the philanthropic world, and others that unless the areas lying outside the immediate vicinity of central Manchester benefit from regional dynamism, Greater Manchester’s success will be far from complete.
Anyone who looks little more than a mile north, south, east, or west of Manchester’s Albert Square – never mind slightly less adjacent parts such as Oldham and Rochdale – can see that much needs to be improved, including education, skills training, and inclusiveness, in order to ensure long-term success.
Whatever the warped motive of the 22-year-old Abedi, who evidently blew himself up along with the innocent victims, his reprehensible act will not tarnish Manchester’s bright, hopeful future.
I do not claim to understand the world of terrorism, but I do know that those who live in and around Manchester and other cities need to feel part of their community and share its aspirations.
Residents who identify with their community are less likely to harm it – and more likely to contribute actively to its renewed vigor.
Now more than ever, Manchester needs the vision that the Northern Powerhouse provides.
It is a vision that other cities and regions would do well to emulate.
Why Pick on BNP Paribas?
CAMBRIDGE – To Europeans with whom I speak, the $8.9 billion fine imposed on the French financial-services company BNP Paribas for violating American sanctions against Cuba, Iran, and Sudan seems excessive.
Yes, BNP did something seriously wrong.
But $8.9 billion?
Isn’t that extremely disproportionate for an otherwise highly responsible bank?
French President François Hollande asked US President Barack Obama to intervene to have the fine reduced, as did the European Union’s commissioner for the internal market and services, Michel Barnier.
The fine is indeed much higher than those levied before.
Hefty fines for currency-trading violations are not new (HSBC, for example, was hit with a $1.9 billion fine in 2012); but a fine close to $10 billion is.
Three factors, not all of which are being discussed, seem to explain the size of the penalty.
First, BNP’s infraction was part of a pattern of deliberate and repeated behavior.
Second, the settlement came at a time when the American authorities faced heavy criticism for being soft on big banks during and after the 2008 financial crisis.
Finally, and more speculatively, the United States’ effort to make finance a more efficacious foreign-policy tool could have affected its treatment of BNP.
On the first issue, European businesspeople and media organizations need to appreciate fully how US prosecutors of financial crimes think.
Once an investigation shows clearly that wrongdoing has occurred, the authorities expect the target to come clean, cooperate, and restructure the firm to ensure that the infractions do not recur.
But BNP continued the banned transactions and knowingly sought to cover its tracks.
The transfer documentation reportedly was regularly stripped of key details such as the destination of wire transfers, so that the transaction would be harder to investigate and less likely to provide evidence of malfeasance.
In American corporate criminal actions, the targeted US firm often brings in a prominent figure – a former prosecutor or a former judge – to investigate the behavior and people involved and report to the target’s board of directors.
The latest example of this practice now in the news is that of General Motors, which hired Anton Valukas, a prominent former prosecutor who examined and reported on the dealings of the failed investment bank Lehman Brothers to the bankruptcy court.
Valukas’s task for GM was to investigate and report on the company’s faulty ignition switches, which have been linked to 13 deaths.
The targeted firm then typically fires the most egregious wrongdoers and puts management-control systems in place to reduce the chance that similar problems will arise in the future.
Perhaps the investigation interprets ambiguity in a way most favorable to the organization and its senior management, but it is understood that the investigation will indeed uncover the core facts and lead to effective reforms.
Some might view this way of proceeding as moralism, though some of it results from under-staffed, under-funded prosecutors economizing on resources.
The target pays for its own investigation.
BNP did not seem to do any of this with gusto; its investigation did not match the effort made, for example, by GM.
It did not prevent subsequent violations by implementing effective controls to detect problems.
The second factor is that BNP’s case came to a head at a time when US prosecutors were being accused of treating banks as “too big to jail,” for fear that pressing charges against them would weaken them too much and thus undermine the real economy.
BNP just happened to be one of the next banks in line for prosecution and thus found itself in the crosshairs.
BNP did lobby European authorities to make a too-big-to-jail plea to the US authorities.
The European authorities made the plea, claiming that the large fine would cripple BNP; it did not work.
Finally, bear in mind that the case coincided with the crises in Ukraine and elsewhere, with the major US enforcement action being financial and economic sanctions on Russia, the largest of which are still being threatened.
Recall BNP’s transgressions: the US barred financial transactions with Sudan, Iran, and Cuba through banks that touched US soil (or the US dollar) in their dealings.
Most banks complied. BNP did not, engineering secret transactions involving all three countries.
At a time when the US is reluctant or unable to project military might to back up its foreign-policy goals, it is seeking to use financial might as a surrogate.
The effort might induce a financial backlash in the future, but BNP’s problems emerged when effective sanctions were at the forefront of policymakers’ minds – and, one suspects, not absent from prosecutors’ minds.
If the US is to make its financial weaponry an effective foreign-policy tool, big banks cannot blithely proceed to do what US authorities have prohibited.
It would take only a few noncompliant banks to render financial sanctions ineffective.
And it is difficult to detect which banks are not complying and to what extent.
So when one miscreant is discovered, the enforcement authorities hit it hard, to signal to others that, while they might not get caught, the financial penalties will far exceed the limited benefits of disobeying the government’s foreign-policy edicts.
This general move for criminal enforcement – greater penalties to account for the difficulties of detection – is a standard prosecutorial move in the US and around the world.
Thus, European critics of the fine imposed on BNP Paribas are right to emphasize its disproportionate nature. What they overlook is that this was precisely the point.
Learning from Martin Luther About Technological Disruption
GENEVA – Five hundred years ago this week, a little-known priest and university lecturer in theology did something unremarkable for his time: he nailed a petition to a door, demanding an academic debate on the Catholic Church’s practice of selling “indulgences” – promises that the buyer or a relative would spend less time in purgatory after they died.
Today, Martin Luther’s “95 Theses,” posted at the Castle Church in Wittenberg, Germany (he simultaneously sent a copy to his boss, Cardinal Albrecht von Brandenburg), are widely recognized as the spark that started the Protestant Reformation.
Within a year, Luther had become one of Europe’s most famous people, and his ideas – which challenged not only Church practice and the Pope’s authority, but ultimately man’s relationship with God – had begun to reconfigure systems of power and identity in ways that are still felt today.
What made Luther’s actions so momentous?
After all, calls for reforming the Church had been occurring regularly for centuries.
As the historian Diarmaid MacCulloch writes in A History of Christianity: The First Three Thousand Years, the two centuries before Luther featured near-constant challenges to papal supremacy on issues of philosophy, theology, and politics.
How did the concerns of a minor theologian in Saxony lead to widespread religious and political upheaval?
A central piece of the puzzle is the role of emerging technology.
A few decades before Luther developed his argument, a German blacksmith named Johannes Gutenberg had invented a new system of movable-type printing, allowing the reproduction of the written word at greater speeds and lower costs than the laborious and less-durable woodblock approach.
The printing press was a revolutionary – and exponential – technology for the dissemination of ideas.
In 1455, the “Gutenberg Bible” was printed at a rate of roughly 200 pages per day, significantly more than the 30 pages per day that a well-trained scribe could produce.
By Luther’s time, the daily printing rate of a single press had increased to roughly 1,500 single-sided sheets.
Improved printing efficiency, combined with steep declines in cost, led to a dramatic increase in access to the written word between 1450 and 1500, even though only an estimated 6% of the population was literate.
Luther quickly grasped the potential of the printing press to spread his message, effectively inventing new forms of publishing that were short, clear, and written in German, the language of the people.
Perhaps Luther’s most enduring personal contribution came via his translation of the Bible from Greek and Hebrew into German.
He was determined to “speak as men do in the marketplace,” and more than 100,000 copies of the “Luther Bible” were printed in Wittenberg over the following decades, compared to just 180 copies of the Latin Gutenberg Bible.
This new use of printing technology to produce short, punchy pamphlets in the vernacular transformed the industry itself.
In the decade before Luther’s theses, Wittenberg printers published, on average, just eight books annually, all in Latin and aimed at local university audiences.
But, according to the British historian Andrew Pettegree, between 1517 and Luther’s death in 1546, local publishers “turned out at least 2,721 works” – and average of “91 books per year,” representing some three million individual copies.
Pettegree calculates that a third of all books published during this period were written by Luther himself, and that the pace of publishing continued to increase after his death.
Luther effectively published a piece of writing every two weeks – for 25 years.
The printing press greatly expanded the accessibility of the religious controversy that Luther helped fuel, galvanizing the revolt against the Church.
Research by the economic historian Jared Rubin indicates that the mere presence of a printing press in a city before 1500 greatly increased the likelihood that the city would become Protestant by 1530.
In other words, the closer you lived to a printing press, the more likely you were to change the way you viewed your relationship with the Church, the most powerful institution of the time, and with God.
There are at least two contemporary lessons to be drawn from this technological disruption.
For starters, in the context of the modern era’s “Fourth Industrial Revolution” – which Klaus Schwab of the World Economic Forum defines as a fusion of technologies blending the physical, digital, and biological spheres – it is tempting to assess which technologies could be the next printing press.
Those who stand to lose from them might even move to defend the status quo, as the Council of Trent did in 1546, when it banned the printing and sale of any Bible versions other than the official Latin Vulgate, without Church approval.
But perhaps the most enduring lesson of Luther’s call for a scholarly debate – and his use of technology to deliver his views – is that it failed.
Instead of a series of public discussions about the Church’s evolving authority, the Protestant Reformation became a bitter battle played out via mass communication, splitting not just a religious institution but also an entire region.
Worse, it became a means to justify centuries of atrocities, and triggered the Thirty Years’ War, the deadliest religious conflict in European history.
The question today is how we can ensure that new technologies support constructive debate.
The world remains full of heresies that threaten our identities and cherished institutions; the difficulty is to view them not as ideas that must be violently suppressed, but as opportunities to understand where and how current institutions are excluding people or failing to deliver promised benefits.
Calls for more constructive engagement may sound facile, naive, or even morally precarious.
But the alternative is not just the hardening of divisions and estrangement of communities; it is widespread dehumanization, a tendency that current technologies seem to encourage.
Today’s Fourth Industrial Revolution could be an opportunity to reform our relationship with technology, amplifying the best of human nature.
To grasp it, however, societies will need a subtler understanding of the interplay of identity, power, and technology than they managed during Luther’s time.
Media Capture in the Digital Age
NEW YORK – The last couple of years have not been good for freedom of expression.
The governments of Poland, Hungary, and Turkey have become increasingly authoritarian and – like leaders in the Balkans, China, and Russia – increasingly eager to control public discourse.
In the United States, too, President Donald Trump relentlessly attempts to discredit the news media, and his administration is unprecedentedly inaccessible to the press.
The age of censors physically redacting newspapers, as I have seen in Vietnam and Myanmar, is mostly over.
But, as recent developments show, press freedom remains highly vulnerable, as governments and “vested interests networked with politics,” in the words of the political scientist Alina Mungiu-Pippidi, engage in a kind of soft control that can be described as “media capture.”
Economists used the term “capture” after the financial crisis of 2008 to describe how regulators, who often came from (and returned to) the industry they were supposed to oversee, failed to police the sector properly.
Media capture works in much the same way, with political leaders either owning media outlets outright (think of Italy’s Silvio Berlusconi) or ensuring that media leaders are loyal to them, whether through cronyism or punishment.
One of the first orders of business for Poland’s far-right government, led unofficially by Jarosław Kaczyński, was to adopt a new media law allowing it to hire and fire the heads of public broadcasting networks.
In Turkey, President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s government has jailed critical journalists – such as the well-known columnist Ahmet Altan and his brother Mehmet, a professor – and closed down or seized control of media companies, using fear to shape reporting.
In a less extreme version of Erdoğan’s approach, Trump bullies his critics, such as CNN and The New York Times, encouraging others, such as the Wall Street Journal, to treat him favorably.
Elsewhere, government cronies do the bullying: in South Africa, the politically connected Gupta family has targeted former Business Day and Financial Mail editor Peter Bruce for criticizing President Jacob Zuma.
Leaders may also try to control the narrative by denying access to potentially critical media organizations, as has occurred in the US and, more aggressively, in crisis-ridden Venezuela under President Nicolás Maduro.
Such media capture is vital to enable governments – especially those pursuing what could be unpopular policies – to sustain public support.
Trump’s campaign against the “fake news media” has enabled him to retain the loyalty of much of his base, despite revelations that would have buried any other US politician.
Just as media capture shapes public perceptions, it can also shape economic outcomes.
The economist Maria Petrova argues that media capture can fuel inequality, particularly if the rich are doing the capturing (rather than politicians, who can often be voted out of office).
Likewise, Giacomo Corneo of the Free University of Berlin believes that increased economic concentration makes media bias more likely.
Media capture is not a new phenomenon.
But the Internet was supposed to free us from it, at least those in countries without overt online censorship.
As entry barriers fell, the proliferation of media outlets, it was believed, would make it difficult to capture them all.
Even if some outlets were captured, the media could still be an effective watchdog, so long as there was sufficient diversity.
This expectation was reinforced by the assumption that more competition could lead to higher-quality news.
But the opposite may have happened.
The rise of digital media rendered traditional media outlets’ business models untenable.
Advertisers migrated to the Internet, where slots are cheap, and consumers, with seemingly infinite free options, became less willing to pay for content.
As a result, traditional media have endured precipitous declines in revenue and large-scale job losses.
Dwindling resources undermined the quality of reporting, especially because many cash-strapped outlets, as Science Po’s Julia Cagé argues, tried to appeal to as broad an audience as possible.
The need to chase clicks on sites like Facebook, Twitter, and Google eroded the ability of legacy media owners to perform their traditional role in ensuring accountability.
Declining media revenues promoted capture in another key way: it shifted the incentive for owning a media outlet.
If a newspaper will not provide much in the way of economic returns, the main inducement for purchasing or running one becomes influence.
The billionaire American casino owner Sheldon Adelson, for example, didn’t purchase The Las Vegas Review-Journal in 2015 or capture Israeli media for the money.
As the media landscape increasingly lends itself to capture, political and corporate accountability will only decline.
That is why the Center for International Media Assistance has just released a new report shining a spotlight on the phenomenon – and calling for solutions.
Free and healthy news media are essential to a well-functioning democracy.
If we are to protect the latter, we must defend the former at all costs.
Learning from Russia’s Other Media War
WASHINGTON, DC – Misinformation and propaganda have been around for as long as mass communication.
What has changed is the speed and scale of the delivery.
Social media platforms have intensified the spread of pseudoscience and conspiracy theories, threatening democratic institutions in frightening new ways.
One only has to Google “Russia” and “Trump” to see the impact of so-called fake news on democracy.
But the best way to fight disinformation may be to follow the example set by Ukraine, a country that has faced its own barrage of Russian-funded deceit.
Around the world, people who believe that facts still matter are fighting back.
US news organizations are fortifying their positions by emphasizing core journalistic practices such as source verification and fact checking.
Independent verifiers and fact checkers have also become important resources for the public.
But as the line between news producer and consumer blurs, it is becoming increasingly difficult to navigate the swamp of misinformation.
While a number of new initiatives – such as the News Literacy Project’s Checkology training courses, and Factitious, an online game that tests users’ ability to identify fake news – are trying to bolster the public’s filtering capacity, the impact has so far been limited.
Owing to confirmation bias, exposure to concepts that conflict with ingrained beliefs may entrench assumptions, rather than leading us to revise them.
And, in a media landscape where even politicians rely on data mining and neuroscience to craft messages based on voters’ state of mind, it is hard to separate truth from falsehood.
Against this background, training in “media literacy” – skills to help analyze and evaluate news – has become almost sexy.
Media literacy programs have been around for decades in the US, focusing on issues like media bias and the impact of violence on children.
But media literacy for today’s world means equipping people of all ages with the means to navigate an increasingly convoluted information ecosystem.
And, as my organization’s recent experience in Ukraine demonstrates, formal training in media literacy may be the best means of winning the war on state-sponsored, politically motivated propaganda.
Russia’s propaganda war on Ukraine – a well funded, widely distributed, and highly sophisticated media drive meant to undermine the Ukrainian government’s legitimacy – has been ongoing for years.
The Russian effort has been so aggressive that, in 2015, the Ukrainian government reportedly warned officials at Facebook and within the US government that a similar strategy could be used against the US.
Facebook appears to have dismissed that warning, but media development organizations like mine did not.
In October 2015, experts from IREX – backed by funding from the Canadian government and the support of local Ukrainian organizations – launched a nine-month media literacy-training course called Learn to Discern (L2D).
Through skills-based workshops and fake news awareness campaigns, we sought to equip citizens with tools to identify Russia’s fabricated stories.
The results were encouraging.
Program participants reported gaining a deeper appreciation of what is needed to consume news wisely.
For example, when we surveyed people at the beginning of the course, only 21% said that they “almost always” crosschecked the news they consume, a troubling rate for a country where trust in media is low but consumption is high.
After the training, the percentage surged to 81%.
We also found that the program produced ripple effects: 91% of trainees shared the knowledge they received with an average of six people, such as family members and co-workers.
An estimated 90,000 Ukrainians were reached indirectly.
The L2D training drew on principles developed in the US, but built the methodology from the ground up.
Collaborating with Ukrainian experts, we incorporated actual media consumption, sharing, and production patterns into the course design.
Most important, we imparted critical thinking skills, teaching participants how to select and process media, not what to consume.
L2D trainers worked across peer networks, building knowledge and skills on the basis of trusted relationships.
Research shows that loyalty to social groups, plus shared identity and values, have an outsize influence on what we discern to be true.
Perhaps the program’s most innovative feature was its focus on teaching consumers how to detect emotional manipulation, and how to disengage from such information.
In a country where emotions regarding Russian influence run high, this skill is essential.
Long after L2D formally ended, trainers have continued running programs independently, reflecting growth in demand for their services.
Surveys conducted this year indicate that trainees, too, remain engaged in combating the fake news phenomenon in their country.
Our experience in Ukraine demonstrates that a multi-layered approach, working at the levels of critical thinking, individual and group psychology, and social trust, provides a better defense against fake news than simple fact checking.
Clearly, more work must be done to boost healthy skepticism among news consumers and increase demand for factual information.
But media literacy training, if organized with local needs in mind, can help.
As disinformation amplifies threats to democracy, and the debate about how to defuse fake news intensifies, consumers can take comfort in knowing that with a little practice, it is possible to discern fact from well-concealed fiction.
Facing Down Mental Illness
DAVOS – Contrary to common perception, mental illness is a problem that is neither new nor unique to the developed world.
What we call schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are recognizable in literature dating back to ancient Greece, and The Anatomy of Melancholy, published in 1621 by the English scholar Robert Burton, remains one of the most astute descriptions of depression.
Today, low- and middle-income countries account for most of the morbidity and 75% of the suicides that result from mental illness.
What is new, and encouraging, is the heightened attention now being given to the problem.
Last year at Davos, I helped launch a new Global Agenda Council on Mental Health, after a study by the World Economic Forum and Harvard School of Public Health projected that the global economic costs of mental illness over the next two decades would exceed the costs of cancer, diabetes, and respiratory ailments combined.
With the stakes so high, the human and economic case for leaders to take mental health seriously is clearly compelling.
As policymakers act, they would be wise to bear in mind that mental disorders are brain disorders.
Too many people dismiss mental illnesses as problems of character or lack of will, rather than recognizing them as serious, often fatal, medical disorders.
The brain is a bodily organ just like any other.
We should no more blame a person for a malfunctioning brain than for a malfunctioning pancreas, liver, or heart.
People with brain disorders deserve exactly the same level and quality of medical care as we expect when confronted with disorders of any other part of the body.
Consider depression, the most common mental illness, which must be distinguished from the sadness, disappointment, or frustration we all experience in our lives.
William Styron’s 1989 memoir, Darkness Visible, rightly calls “depression” a weak word for a debilitating condition that is marked by hopelessness, helplessness, and dread.
In extreme forms, depression can be so disabling that the thought of getting out of bed or making a phone call becomes overwhelming.
Functioning effectively at the workplace can be intensely challenging, which is reflected in the growing recognition of a condition known as “presenteeism,” a variation on “absenteeism”: depressed employees are physically present but mentally absent.
Mental illnesses can often lead to other health problems.
Brain disorders like depression and schizophrenia greatly increase the risk of developing chronic ailments, such as cardiovascular and respiratory diseases.
People with mental illnesses and substance-abuse issues are at increased risk of infectious diseases like HIV/AIDS.
Furthermore, mental disorders have a profound impact on the outcome of other illnesses.
After a heart attack, for example, the prognosis depends on the presence or absence of depression more than on virtually any measure of cardiac function.
That is why health-care policymakers should embrace a simple adage: “no health without mental health.”
Indeed, mental illnesses can be as fatal as physical ones.
Suicide causes more deaths than homicide.
Around 7% of people with major depressive disorder will take their own lives.
Globally, more than 800,000 people kill themselves every year.
The number of people scarred by a loved one’s death is much greater; every suicide has many victims.
Tackling the problem will require innovative approaches.
It is not enough simply to make treatment available.
People with psychotic disorders may deny that they are ill, and those suffering from depression may be too consumed by self-loathing to feel worthy of help.
Even in the developed world, it is estimated that only about half of all people suffering from depression are diagnosed and treated.
According to the World Health Organization, in developing countries, 76-85% of people with severe mental disorders are not treated.
We need sensitive ways to identify those at risk and to help those who are most disabled.
Not everybody with a mental illness needs expensive drugs, hospital care, or even direct access to highly trained psychiatrists.
We may not have the equivalent of a vaccine for measles or a bed net for malaria, but low-cost, highly effective interventions are possible for most people either at risk for, or already suffering from, a mental illness.
In low-resource environments, local residents or family members can be trained to provide brief, effective psychotherapies that treat moderate forms of depression or anxiety.
Phone- or Internet-based therapy can be used as well.
That said, it should be acknowledged that treatments for mental illness remain far from infallible.
Of those who get help, only about half receive the right treatment, and about half of those receiving treatment regress.
The only way to improve these percentages is to deepen our understanding of normal and abnormal brain functioning.
We need research to develop better treatments for brain disorders in general, and for mental illnesses in particular.
Fortunately, some important initiatives launched in the last year are moving us in the right direction.
In April, the United States National Institutes of Health introduced a ten-year BRAIN Initiative, joining similar efforts in the European Union, Israel, Japan, China, Australia, and Canada.
We have also seen unprecedented levels of support from philanthropists.
In the US, for example, $650 million was donated recently to the Stanley Center for Psychiatric Research.
In the United Kingdom, a new charity, MQ, is awarding funds for research on psychological treatments.
Breakthroughs in biomedical research offer hope that cures for brain disorders will be found.
By broadening access to existing treatments and investing in research to develop new therapies, we can aspire to eliminate one of the oldest and most widespread causes of human misery.
Angela Merkel’s New Germany
BERLIN – German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union (CDU) may have won a majority in September’s federal election, but that does not mean that the country’s future is clear.
What emerges as Merkel seeks to form a new coalition with the Greens and the Free Democrats will not only shape Germany’s economic trajectory over the next four years; it will also determine the fate of the country’s transformation into a truly open society.
In less than a generation, Germany, once the sick man of Europe, has emerged as a global economic powerhouse.
But the truth is that Germany’s current economic success is less the result of good policies than of favorable external conditions, especially in Europe, which ensured strong demand for German exports.
To be sure, important domestic economic reforms enabled Germany to take advantage of external demand.
But they were undertaken long before Merkel came to power, and few meaningful economic reforms have been implemented during her 12-year tenure.
For example, domestic private investment remains weak, partly owing to overregulated services and heavy bureaucratic burdens.
Moreover, as the German government has preached austerity to its neighbors, it has increased social spending on pensions and transfers, all while allowing net public investment to turn negative.
The much-needed overhaul of the tax system once hyped by the CDU has failed to materialize.
And, though employment has increased during Merkel’s tenure, job creation has not succeeded in reducing the low-income segment of the labor market.
The parties most likely to form the next government – the CDU (and its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union), the Greens, and the Free Democrats – are now fighting over how best to use Germany’s large fiscal surpluses to serve their respective constituents.
Whatever decision they make, Germany’s economic performance is likely to remain strong, at least in terms of trade and a balanced budget.
The real test of the so-called Jamaica coalition (named for the parties’ colors) lies elsewhere.
What Merkel has lacked in economic-policy achievements, she has made up for in bringing about social change.
Under her leadership, Germany has become the open society it is today.
But it is also an increasingly divided society.
As it stands, some 20% of Germany’s population of 82 million has a migrant background, and close to five million are Muslim.
This multiculturalism is reflected in changing perspectives on the part of all Germans.
Four out of five Germans now consider Islam and homosexuality to be part of German society; three out of four say the same about migrants and refugees.
And Germany has one of the most pro-European populations on the continent.
The last three governments, all led by Merkel, have contributed mightily to this transformation.
Critics call Merkel the first social democratic chancellor from a conservative party, because she has embraced many progressive policies, while preaching stability and traditional values.
Arguably her most important decision – which almost cost her the chancellorship, but might ultimately shape her legacy – was her 2015 decision to accept, despite fierce opposition from many in her own party, almost 1.5 million asylum-seekers and push for their integration into German society.
Germany’s Merkel-led governments have also supported early childhood education and children’s rights, while overseeing substantial progress on gender equality.
Broader, more flexible access to the labor market, expansion of early childhood facilities, and financial incentives have driven an increase in female labor-force participation to more than 70%, one of the highest in the industrialized world.
The current German government also implemented a 30% quota for women on supervisory boards of large companies, as well as a wage transparency law aimed at reducing the country’s gender pay gap, which is still a whopping 21%.
While Merkel did not spearhead these reforms – not least because she had to avoid alienating those in her party who viewed them negatively – she offered tacit support.
Similarly, though Merkel herself voted earlier this year against legalizing gay marriage, which many in her party do not support, she accepted graciously the Bundestag’s decision, declaring that she hoped the vote would not only promote “respect between different opinions,” but also bring “more social cohesion and peace.”
Ultimately, it is Merkel’s talent at bridging social and political divides that has made Germany’s transformation into an open society possible.
And this, not economic policy, might ultimately become the greatest achievement of her chancellorship.
In some ways, Germany has already moved beyond the point of no return on its path toward openness, owing to Merkel’s 2015 refugee policy.
Yet there are enormous challenges ahead.
Beyond the technical and social challenges associated with the successful integration of refugees, there is a need for greater tolerance toward Islam and diversity more generally on the part of all Germans.
Further changes to family and gender policies and an overhaul of the education system will also be needed.
As Germany continues to debate what it means to be German, the outcome of the current coalition negotiations will determine whether Merkel’s next government confronts these challenges effectively.
If it does, Merkel will be remembered as the architect of a new German society.
The Middle East’s Oil-Price Problem
CAMBRIDGE – Between 2014 and 2016, Middle Eastern oil-exporting countries’ revenues fell by an average of more than one-third – or 15% of GDP – and their current-account surpluses have swung violently to double-digit deficits.
Notwithstanding a small recent uptick, most forecasts predict that oil prices will remain at current levels for the long term.
If so, this will deliver a macroeconomic shock of historic proportions and profoundly change the Middle East.
Most oil-producing countries have already started to cut expenditures, borrow, and draw down their reserves.
But countries with large external imbalances, low reserves, or high debts will increasingly feel financially constrained, if they don’t already.
Low oil prices will hit Algeria, Bahrain, Iraq, Iran, Oman, and war-torn Libya and Yemen before the richer countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council.
But, ultimately, each country’s economic fate will depend on the choices that it makes today.
Oil-producing countries can either cut consumption, or maintain it by improving productivity.
Naturally, any country would prefer the latter, so the region’s governments are now trying to grow out of their problems by diversifying their economies.
Fortunately, the region is better positioned for a growth takeoff than it was in the 1990s, owing to major education and infrastructure investments that were made during the last decade of high oil prices.
But to avoid deep cuts to current consumption, any credible growth strategy will have to put structural reforms before even macroeconomic stabilization, lest failure to deliver growth leads to a financial crisis and even deeper consumption cuts in the future.
Whether the region’s governments are finally serious about implementing real change remains to be seen.
The lessons of the last oil shock, which came on the heels of a collapse in state-led industrialization in the mid-1980s, were hard to absorb.
Because governments had borrowed to avoid making necessary adjustments during the 1973-1985 oil boom, the eventual bust precipitated a debt crisis.
Most countries had no choice but to cut expenditures and accept a lost decade of anemic growth.
Since then, governments across the region have resorted to crude repression to keep public discontent and political opponents at bay.
By the end of the 1990s, they had restored macroeconomic balance, but implemented merely superficial structural reforms.
And when growth did return, in the 2000s, it was driven almost entirely by another oil boom.
As in the 1980s, the region’s governments today have tied oil revenues to consumption subsidies, public-sector employment, and public investment.
When adjustments are needed, they generally take the form of fiscal cuts, rather than structural reforms.
And these cuts have mostly hit public investment, thus undermining future growth prospects.
Now that oil prices have plateaued, private investment is falling, domestic firms are idling, and unemployment is rising.
More fundamentally, governments in oil-producing countries are confronting a political dilemma: Stronger economic growth, though desirable, requires regimes to take risks that could endanger their very survival.
Decoupling oil revenues from public subsidies will require a new social contract that is based less on guaranteed consumption and more on personal autonomy.
But, while a diversified economy presupposes more space for private enterprise, governments in the region, especially during boom times, have tended to favor politically connected firms, and blocked those they view as a threat.
This practice has always impeded competition, distorted bank lending, and reduced economic dynamism; but it has helped autocrats preserve their power.
Unfortunately, this system of patronage and clientelism has become only more entrenched since the Arab Spring, as governments have increasingly had to buy political consent.
Oil exporters, with the exception of Libya and Yemen, may have avoided major political changes, but the autocratic bargain – and any attempt to unravel it – has become more expensive.
Some regimes will be tempted to stick with the status quo, hope for a recovery in oil prices, and crack down harder on civil society in the meantime.
If that happens, the situation could turn out even worse than in the 1990s.
The region’s people have grown even more accustomed to high levels of state spending, and the public discontent revealed by the Arab Spring has not disappeared.
Those countries that opt for reform will require not only political courage, but also well-crafted policies.
In most Middle Eastern countries, labor-market participation is now among the lowest in the world, and energy-to-output ratios are among the highest.
To increase productivity while preserving social stability, subsidies should be removed with the goal of improving efficiency, not simply to make fiscal cuts.
And a new fiscal-transfer system should be established to support investment rather than consumption.
However, governments cannot simply liberalize markets and hope for the best.
The region’s private sector will need active, sustained support to grow and mature.
Managing mixed economies that include state-owned enterprises and an inchoate private sector will require discipline, so that productive assets are not squandered, or privatized at fire-sale prices.
External imbalances will pose the largest challenge for the region.
Exchange-rate flexibility is not particularly useful when a country has no export capacity, and establishing import or foreign-exchange controls would only generate corruption and rent-seeking.
Still, some countries may have room to raise tariffs on certain consumer goods. And if they develop renewable-energy sources and step up their conservation efforts, they can increase their energy exports.
It is hard to predict what a future of low oil revenues will mean for the Middle East.
The region’s elites can either embrace change, or do nothing and risk a precipitous decline.
The time to choose is running out.
Breaking the Middle East’s Cycle of Terror
FEZ – In July, Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi announced that the Islamic State (ISIS) had been driven out of Mosul, the country’s second-largest city, which it captured three years ago.
Sooner or later, it will also lose Raqqa, the capital of its self-styled caliphate – and the last true city under its control.
But these defeats do not mean the downfall of ISIS, much less Islamist terrorism, or that the Middle East’s most acute conflicts will be resolved anytime soon.
To be sure, the fading dream of an Islamic caliphate will weaken the ability of ISIS and kindred groups to recruit disaffected youth.
Already, the flow of foreign would-be jihadists crossing from Turkey into Syria to join ISIS has plunged, from 2,000 per month to about 50.
But such groups still have powerful lures at their disposal.
Most fundamentally, they are able to offer disillusioned young people a sense of purpose and belonging.
The fact that this purpose entails murder, terror, and mayhem may make it all the more appealing among frustrated and resentful youth.
Despite recent setbacks, writing off the threat posed by ISIS is as unwarranted as it is premature.
Consider the history of al-Qaeda, which proves that even if a state that nourishes a terrorist group fails, a radical ideology can continue to fuel violence near and far.
The group’s leaders must simply adjust their methods, in order to continue attracting recruits and planning attacks from outside the borders of a friendly sovereign state.
To that end, in Iraq, terrorist groups will continue to exploit sectarianism, which had divided the country long before the United States invaded it in 2003.
More broadly, they can capitalize on escalating tensions between Sunni and Shia Muslims to attract alienated young Sunnis.
This increasingly dangerous dynamic is apparent in the decision of Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates to cut diplomatic ties with Qatar, owing to its alleged ties with regional terrorist groups and Iran, Saudi Arabia’s main rival for regional influence.
It is also visible in the devastating proxy war in Yemen, which has become a key battleground in the Saudi-Iranian power struggle.
Against this background, it seems likely that ISIS, from its scattered bases in Egypt’s Sinai Peninsula, Iraq, Libya, and Yemen, will be able to continue planning and executing terrorist attacks in the Middle East and beyond.
But there are ways to avoid such an outcome – or at least minimize the damage.
For starters, governments and non-governmental actors in the Arab world must sever all financial ties to terrorist groups.
Beyond official transfers, this means halting private efforts by individual citizens to fund terror.
States in the region already have harsh legal codes; governments should enforce them more effectively against those who finance terror.
At the same time, religious and political leaders must loudly condemn the violent Islamist ideology that nurtures jihadist movements, spurning them with the same vigor that they reserve for challengers to their own authority.
Qui tacet consentire videtur (silence means consent).
In this case, tacit consent emboldens terrorist actors, with deadly results.
The countries of the Middle East have become associated with extremist ideologies and terror the world over.
If they are to recover their reputations, and restore the health of their societies and economies, they must act decisively to weaken the allure of terrorist recruiters.
Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia have all made some moves in this direction, but they cannot do it alone.
Like these countries, others in the Middle East must not allow themselves to be lulled into complacency by the ostensible fall of ISIS as a territorial entity.
Ultimately, the only way to break the cycle of terror and violence in the Arab world is to resolve the conflicts within Islam.
To reach that point, however, the region’s governments must urgently pursue a two-prong strategy of interdiction and condemnation.
The Arab World’s Coming Challenges
LONDON – Fifty years after the Six Days War, the Middle East remains a region in seemingly perpetual crisis.
So it is no surprise that, when addressing the region, politicians, diplomats, and the donor and humanitarian community typically focus on the here and now.
Yet, if we are ever to break the modern Middle East’s cycle of crises, we must not lose sight of the future.
And, already, four trends are brewing a new set of problems for the coming decade.
The first trend affects the Levant.
The post-Ottoman order that emerged a century ago – an order based on secular Arab nationalism – has already crumbled.
The two states that gave weight to this system, Iraq and Syria, have lost their central authority, and will remain politically fragmented and socially polarized for at least a generation.
In Lebanon, sectarianism remains the defining characteristic of politics.
Jordan has reached its refugee-saturation point, and continued inflows are placing limited resources under ever-greater pressure.
As for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, there is no new initiative or circumstance on the political horizon that could break the deadlock.
The Middle East is certain to face the continued movement of large numbers of people, first to the region’s calmer areas and, in many cases, beyond – primarily to Europe.
The region is also likely to face intensifying contests over national identities as well, and perhaps even the redrawing of borders – processes that will trigger further confrontations.
The second major trend affects North Africa.
The region’s most populous states – Algeria, Egypt, and Morocco – will maintain the social and political orders that have become entrenched over the last six decades of their post-colonial history.
The ruling structures in these countries enjoy broad popular consent, as well as support from influential institutions, such as labor and farmers’ unions.
They also have effective levers of coercion that serve as backstops for relative stability.
But none of this guarantees smooth sailing for these governments.
On the contrary, they are poised to confront a massive youth bulge, with more than 100 million people under the age of 30 entering the domestic job market in North Africa between now and 2025.
And the vast majority of these young people, products of failed educational systems, will be wholly unqualified for most jobs offering a chance of social mobility.
The sectors best equipped to absorb these young Arabs are tourism, construction, and agriculture.
But a flourishing tourism sector is not in the cards – not least because of the resurgence of militant Islamism, which will leave North Africa exposed to the risk of terror attacks for years to come.
Moreover, a declining share of the European food market and diminished investments in real estate undermine the capacity of agriculture and construction to absorb young workers.
The likely consequences of North Africa’s youth bulge are thus renewed social unrest and potentially sizeable migration flows to Europe.
The Gulf used to provide a regional safety valve.
For more than a half-century, Gulf countries absorbed millions of workers, primarily from their Arab neighbors’ lower middle classes.
The Gulf was also the main source of investment capital, not to mention tens of billions of dollars in remittances, to the rest of the region.
And many Arab countries viewed it as the lender of last resort.
But – and herein lies the third key trend – the Gulf economies are now undergoing an upgrade, ascending various industrial value chains.
This reduces their dependence on low-skill foreign workers.
In the coming years, the Gulf countries can be expected to import fewer workers from the rest of the Arab world, and to export less capital to it.
The Gulf might even become increasingly destabilized.
Several Gulf powers and Iran are engaged in a partly sectarian proxy war in Yemen – one that will not end anytime soon.
And now, several Sunni powers are forcefully trying to compel one of their own, Qatar, to abandon a regional strategy it has pursued for decades.
The pressures being generated across the Arabian Peninsula could produce further political shocks.
That is all the more likely, given mounting domestic pressure for reform from a technologically savvy and globally engaged young citizenry.
Reforming centuries-old social and political structures will be as difficult as it is necessary.
The fourth trend affects the entire Arab world, as well as Iran and Turkey: the social role of religion is becoming increasingly contested.
The wars and crises of the last six years have reversed much of the progress that political Islam had made in the decade before the so-called Arab Spring uprisings erupted in 2011.
With radicalism becoming increasingly entrenched, on the one hand, and young Muslims putting forward enlightened understandings of their religion, on the other, a battle for the soul of Islam is raging.
The problems implied by these four trends will be impossible for leaders, inside or outside the Arab world, to address all at once, especially at a time of rising populism and nativism across the West.
But action can and should be taken.
The key is to focus on socioeconomic issues, rather than geopolitics.
The West must not succumb to illusions about redrawing borders or shaping new countries; such efforts will yield only disaster.
One highly promising option would be to create a full-on Marshall Plan for the Arab world.
But, in this era of austerity, many Western countries lack the resources, much less public support, for such an effort – most of the Arab world today couldn’t make the most of it in any case.
What leaders – both within and outside the region – can do is pursue large-scale and intelligent investments in primary and secondary education, small and medium-size businesses (which form the backbone of Arab economies), and renewable energy sources (which could underpin the upgrading of regional value chains).
Pursuing this agenda won’t stem the dissolution of the modern Arab state in the Levant. It won’t generate workable social contracts in North Africa.
And it certainly won’t reconcile the sacred with the secular.
But, by attempting to address young people’s socioeconomic frustrations, it can mitigate many of the longer-term consequences of these trends.
The Future of Migration Governance
DHAKA – We live in a rapidly evolving, hyper-connected world, where goods, capital, and people are more mobile than ever before.
But, whereas countries have shown a willingness to cooperate on exchanging goods and capital, the international community has shown little appetite for improving how it governs human mobility.
After the wide-scale persecution and displacement of people in World War II, world leaders took the bold step of crafting the 1951 Refugee Convention.
In doing so, they relinquished a measure of national sovereignty – by accepting the principle of non-refoulement – in order to promote global solidarity toward refugees.
On the other hand, country leaders saw migration as something temporary that could be managed ad hoc, through unilateral or bilateral agreements primarily designed to fill specific labor-market needs in developed economies.
In hindsight, it is now clear that this approach was inadequate for dealing with the upsurge in human mobility that came with global and regional economic integration.
When writing about guest workers in Switzerland, Swiss playwright Max Frisch once observed that, “We asked for workers.
We got people instead.”
He meant that migrants are not goods that can be exported or imported, and they should not be exploited as if they were.
Migrants are human beings with rights, and they are motivated by a complex combination of personal desires, fears, and familial obligations.
Many migrants are searching for jobs because they have missed out on globalization’s unequally distributed gains, and they see no future for themselves if they remain where they are; countless others have been displaced by conflicts or natural disasters.
Today, ungoverned migration is threatening geopolitical stability, burdening border controls, and creating chaos around the world.
The current mechanisms for managing migration have clearly failed to meet existing needs.
The world needs a new, comprehensive global-governance framework to address all issues relating to human mobility.
Achieving such an outcome is Bangladesh’s primary objective as Chair of the 2016 Global Forum on Migration and Development (GFMD), which culminates with the Ninth Annual Forum Meeting in Dhaka on December 10-12.
In 2015, as part of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals for 2030, world leaders pledged to cooperate on migration issues and to “facilitate orderly, safe, regular and responsible migration.”
The SDGs acknowledge migrants’ positive contribution to inclusive growth and sustainable development, and it is high time that our leaders follow through on their promises.
Sadly, governments worldwide have become preoccupied with deterring migration and restricting people’s movement, rather than creating safe, dignified channels for human mobility.
Unsurprisingly, this obsession with control has had little impact on irregular migration flows, because it runs counter to the pull of market forces and the push of personal aspirations.
Populist politicians have taken advantage of the current situation by politicizing migration and scapegoating migrants for socioeconomic problems such as unemployment, welfare-system strains, and deteriorating social cohesion.
But there is still room for hope.
When world leaders gathered at the UN Summit for Refugees and Migrants on September 19, they reaffirmed migrants’ human rights and committed to strengthening global governance on this issue.
At the center of the summit’s unanimously adopted New York Declaration is a commitment to develop two global compacts: to share responsibility for taking in refugees, and to ensure orderly, safe, regular, and responsible migration.
The government of Bangladesh proposed the second compact in April 2016.
That compact, which will be adopted at an inter-governmental conference in 2018, offers an historic opportunity to improve the way governments and other stakeholders cooperate on migration.
Building walls and discriminating against migrants or refugees on the basis of ethnicity or religion is antithetical to the 2030 SDG agenda, which aims to free people from the shackles of poverty, reduce inequality, and promote shared prosperity.
The international community must now ensure that the new global compacts promote these broad ambitions.
This will require national governments and global-governance institutions to implement bold policies that make migration both easier and more orderly.
It will also require them to protect migrants and refugees’ rights, prevent ethnic or religious discrimination, and provide emergency assistance when needed.
And it will encourage them to maximize migrants’ positive economic impact on both their new countries and their countries of origin, by reducing financial and human costs and integrating newcomers into the labor market.
To achieve the best outcome, the two global compacts will need to be pursued in a coordinated fashion, and treated as two parts of a single framework for governing migration.
In 2017, governments will begin to negotiate the details of this future framework.
This may include a legally binding convention; a political declaration of principles to guide conduct; or operational commitments with goals, targets, and indicators of success, combined with a robust monitoring mechanism.
These options should not be seen as mutually exclusive.
If diplomacy prevails, and international arrangements are crafted carefully, one could imagine an outcome similar to the 2015 Paris climate agreement: binding commitments in some areas, non-binding guiding principles in others, and a shared promise by member states to take concrete action and to report their progress regularly.
Such an approach would help to guarantee effectiveness.
As the Chair of the GFMD, Bangladesh will communicate the Dhaka summit’s recommendations to countries’ negotiators.
We will push for an agreement among political leaders at the inter-governmental conference in 2018 that vastly improves how migration is managed.
With international cooperation, we can unleash the full social and economic potential of migration.
And, in doing so, we will make migrants safer, societies more harmonious, and economies more prosperous.
The Greening of the Miners
LONDON – Donald Trump’s presidency in the United States has turned mining – and the coal industry in particular – into a political cause célèbre over the last year.
In June, during his first White House cabinet meeting, Trump suggested that his energy policies were putting miners back to work and transforming a troubled sector of the economy.
But Trump is mistaken to think that championing the cause of miners and paying respect to a difficult profession will be sufficient to make mining sustainable.
To achieve that, a far more complex set of interdependencies must be navigated.
Debates about mining and the environment are often framed in terms of a “nexus” between extraction of a resource and the introduction of other resources into the extraction process.
The forthcoming Routledge Handbook of the Resource Nexus, which I co-edited, defines the term as the relationship between two or more naturally occurring materials that are used as inputs in a system that provides services to humans.
In the case of coal, the “nexus” is between the rock and the huge amounts of water and energy needed to mine it.
For decision-makers, understanding this linkage is critical to effective resource and land-use management.
According to research from 2014, there is an inverse relationship between the grade of ore and the amount of water and energy used to extract it.
In other words, misreading how inputs and outputs interact could have profound environmental consequences.
Moreover, because many renewable energy technologies are built with mined metals and minerals, the global mining industry will play a key role in the transition to a low-carbon future.
Photovoltaic cells may draw energy from the sun, but they are manufactured from cadmium, selenium, and tellurium.
The same goes for wind turbines, which are fashioned from copious amounts of cobalt, copper, and rare-earth oxides.
Navigating the mining industry’s resource nexus will require new governance models that can balance extraction practices with emerging energy needs – like those envisioned by the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
Value creation, profit maximization, and competitiveness must also be measured against the greater public good.
Some within the global mining industry have recognized that the winds are changing.
According to a recent survey of industry practices by CDP, a non-profit energy and environmental consultancy, mining companies from Australia to Brazil are beginning to extract resources while reducing their environmental footprint.
Nonetheless, if the interests of the public, and the planet, are to be protected, the world cannot rely on the business decisions of mining companies alone.
Four key changes are needed to ensure that the industry’s greening trend continues.
First, mining needs an innovation overhaul.
Declining ore grades require the industry to become more energy- and resource-efficient to remain profitable.
And, because water scarcity is among the top challenges facing the industry, eco-friendly solutions are often more viable than conventional ones.
In Chile, for example, copper mines have been forced to start using desalinated water for extraction, while Sweden’s Boliden sources up to 42% of its energy needs from renewables.
Mining companies elsewhere learn from these examples.
Second, product diversification must start now.
With the Paris climate agreement a year old, the transformation of global fossil-fuel markets is only a matter of time.
Companies with a large portfolio of fossil fuels, like coal, will soon face severe uncertainty related to stranded assets, and investors may change their risk assessments accordingly.
Large mining companies can prepare for this shift by moving from fossil fuels to other materials, such as iron ore, copper, bauxite, cobalt, rare earth elements, and lithium, as well as mineral fertilizers, which will be needed in large quantities to meet the SDGs’ targets for global hunger eradication.
Phasing out coal during times of latent overproduction might even be done at a profit.
Third, the world needs a better means of assessing mining’s ecological risks.
Although the industry’s environmental footprint is smaller than that of agriculture and urbanization, extracting materials from the ground can still permanently harm ecosystems and lead to biodiversity loss.
To protect sensitive areas, greater global coordination is needed in the selection of suitable mining sites.
Integrated assessments of subsoil assets, groundwater, and biosphere integrity would also help, as would guidelines for sustainable resource consumption.
Finally, the mining sector must better integrate its value chains to create more economic opportunities downstream.
Establishing models of material flows – such as the ones existing for aluminum and steel – and linking them with “circular economy” strategies, such as waste reduction and reuse, would be a good start.
A more radical change could come from a serious engagement in markets for secondary materials.
“Urban mining” – the salvaging, processing, and delivery of reusable materials from demolition sites – could also be better integrated into current core activities.
The global mining industry is on the verge of transforming itself from fossil-fuel extraction to supplying materials for a greener energy future.
But this “greening” is the result of hard work, innovation, and a complex understanding of the resource nexus. Whatever America’s coal-happy president may believe, it is not the result of political platitudes.
Misery Loves Inflation Targeters’ Company
TOKYO – The United States, Europe, and Japan are all making positive economic strides.
In the US, the unemployment rate is falling, and now stands at just over 4%.
Unemployment remains high in the eurozone, at close to 9%, but that still represents significant progress from the past decade or so.
And Japan has achieved virtually full employment, with labor demand so high that new graduates are able not just to find jobs, but to choose them.
Yet there is one key area where progress seems to be lagging: inflation.
While the US consumer price index reached 2.2% in October, the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan have so far been unable to meet their targets of roughly 2% inflation, with the eurozone’s average annual price growth hovering around 1.5% and Japan’s firmly lodged in the 1% range.
There are good reasons to strive to meet the inflation target. Money markets would be rid of near-zero interest rates.
Concerns about currency appreciation damaging export competitiveness would be assuaged, as globalization and artificial intelligence continue to create competition for workers.
And the expansionary monetary policy pursued by the world’s major central banks in recent years would be vindicated.
Yet when it comes to ordinary people’s wellbeing, meeting the inflation target is not always the best option.
Of course, reining in high inflation is beneficial, as it preserves the value of existing money.
But raising below-target inflation to 2% leaves people worse off, as it causes their savings to lose value continuously, thereby undermining their prosperity.
The late Arthur Okun, who was one of my professors at Yale before serving as Chair of US President Lyndon Johnson’s Council of Economic Advisers, created the so-called misery index, which goes beyond headline GDP growth or the unemployment rate to provide insight into how the average citizen is faring economically.
Okun’s index – the sum of the inflation and unemployment rates – is based on the assumption that an increase in inflation, like an increase in unemployment, creates economic and social costs for a country.
The reality is that the inflation target is a means to an end – to facilitate full employment and faster GDP growth – not an end in itself.
And, at least in Japan, substantial progress toward that end has been made, despite the failure to meet the Bank of Japan’s inflation target.
Signs of full employment in the market for permanent workers could set the stage for a moderate wage-price increase.
That was not the case before 2013, when the implementation of Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s economic-reform program, so-called Abenomics, ended a period of austere monetary policy.
But this has not deterred critics of Abenomics from harping on the non-fulfillment of the inflation target.
The question is why.
Not long ago, I posed that question to a monetary-policy authority (whose name I am not at liberty to divulge).
Rather than provide a straightforward answer, he replied that it was “tricky,” finally landing on the statement that, no matter how low the unemployment rate, the inflation target should be pursued.
This kind of thinking is common among economists, particularly the generation swept up by the “rational expectations” revolution in macroeconomics.
This cohort views economics as the study of models, in which agents’ expectations can be assumed to be rational and consistent with the model.
From this perspective, inflation expectations can be assumed to be either ideal predictions of the future, or at the very least rational ones, with their accuracy and precision undermined only by limitations in information received by economic actors.
Older economists thought differently, assuming that most economic outcomes in the real world are the result of behavior that is at least partly irrational, meaning that expectations should be viewed more as reasonable possibilities than near-certainties.
Because I belong to the generation taught by old sages – Lawrence Klein, Franco Modigliani, and James Tobin – I think this is a worthwhile assessment – one that should be applied to today’s discussions about monetary policy and inflation.
While it is important to recognize the merits of inflation targeting, the misery index, too, has a role to play in helping us to assess the state of our economies – and the success of our policies.
Central Bankers’ Shifting Goalposts
BRUSSELS – The theme of this year’s meeting of the world’s central bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, had little to do with monetary policy.
“Fostering a Dynamic Global Economy” is, of course, an important topic.
But it is telling that the European Central Bank chose, for its own annual gathering, a similar “non-monetary” topic (“Investment and Growth in Advanced Countries”).
There is nothing wrong with central bankers considering challenges in areas like growth, trade, and investment.
But central banks were made independent precisely because it was understood that they would be held accountable for achieving their own objective of maintaining price stability, regardless of the economy’s underlying growth rate.
So why is it that central bankers would rather look at external issues than focus on their own area of responsibility?
The answer, it seems, is that they cannot quite explain their current approach.
Conditions today are very favorable for monetary policymaking, particularly for the ECB – as a brief look at history makes clear.
Since the creation of the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) in January 1999, the ECB has been solely responsible for determining the EMU’s monetary policy.
(Although national currencies remained in circulation until 2002, exchange rates were “irrevocably” fixed from 1999.)
The ECB’s job was hard from the beginning.
After all, when the euro was born, global financial markets were in turmoil, owing to the Asian crisis of 1997 and the Russian default of 1998.
The VIX index, which measures stock-market volatility, had hit 44% in August 1998, and during the euro’s first few years, it hovered around 25-30%, compared to around 12% today.
While unemployment in the eurozone was declining, the rate was close to 10%, and it remained higher than today’s level, 9.3%, for all of 1999.
From a monetary-policy perspective, there was also a need to cope with the deflationary legacy of financial crisis.
Indeed, when the eurozone was established, prices were increasing by less than 2%, and headline inflation was stuck at around 1%.
Those two key indicators of monetary policy are at almost exactly the same levels today, but financial markets are significantly more settled now than they were then.
In 1999, despite slightly below-target inflation, high unemployment, and financial-market volatility, the ECB Governing Council did not even consider zero or negative interest rates, much less unconventional policy measures.
Instead, its first action, in 1999, was to fix the main policy rate at 2%.
Over the course of that year, the ECB did cut the benchmark rate by 50 basis points, to the then-unprecedented level of 1.5%.
But it did so just to give the economy a chance to recover.
After a few months, it reversed course, putting the year-end policy rate back at 2%.
Over the next year, the rate was raised to 3.75%, even though inflation had not accelerated by more than a few dozen basis points.
Today, the ECB is facing a much more comfortable situation.
While inflation is undershooting the 2% target by a similar amount, the labor market appears to be in much better shape.
But is it?
It is widely assumed that a deep recession induces many of the unemployed to leave the labor market, because looking for a job seems useless.
If many such discouraged workers have left the labor market, a recovery of the unemployment rate to pre-recession levels can be misleading.
That is why the unemployment rate needs to be considered in conjunction with the labor-force participation rate.
By that measure, the eurozone is actually doing much better today than in 1999.
With the labor-force participation rate five percentage points higher that it was back then, it seems clear that fewer workers have been discouraged from job-seeking today than at the start of the EMU, and thus that there is less underused potential in the economy.
Against this background, it is difficult to explain why the ECB continues to insist that unconventional monetary-policy measures – such as negative rates and continued bond purchases – are needed.
The long-term inflation outlook might be somewhat more uncertain today.
But can a few dozen basis points in (poorly measured) long-term inflation expectations justify the need for massive quantitative easing and a policy rate 250 points lower than it was at a time of weaker market fundamentals?
This incongruity is not limited to Europe.
In the United States, too, one finds a similar combination of inflation and unemployment today and two decades ago.
In 1999, a core inflation rate of around 2%, combined with unemployment below 5%, justified a federal funds rate of 5% (and a “normal” balance sheet).
Today, the Federal Reserve has kept its benchmark rate below 1.5% – 350 basis points lower than in 1999 – and has postponed any reduction in its bloated balance sheet.
In Japan, inflation is now higher than it was in the wake of the Asian financial crisis; unemployment is at its lowest level in 50 years; and the labor-force participation rate continues to reach record highs.
Yet Japan, like the US and Europe, continues to display a quixotic tendency to tilt at deflation windmills, with rock-bottom interest rates and purchases of massive amounts of government debt.
Central bankers surely wish for a dynamic global economy.
But that is not something they can influence much.
Rather than discussing unrelated issues, they should be focused on explaining why their goalposts have shifted so much – and whether it is time to start moving them back.
The Mystery of the Missing Inflation
NEW YORK – Since the summer of 2016, the global economy has been in a period of moderate expansion, with the growth rate accelerating gradually.
What has not picked up, at least in the advanced economies, is inflation.
The question is why.
In the United States, Europe, Japan, and other developed economies, the recent growth acceleration has been driven by an increase in aggregate demand, a result of continued expansionary monetary and fiscal policies, as well as higher business and consumer confidence.
That confidence has been driven by a decline in financial and economic risk, together with the containment of geopolitical risks, which, as a result, have so far had little impact on economies and markets.
Because stronger demand means less slack in product and labor markets, the recent growth acceleration in the advanced economies would be expected to bring with it a pickup in inflation.
Yet core inflation has fallen in the US this year and remains stubbornly low in Europe and Japan.
This creates a dilemma for major central banks – beginning with the US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank – attempting to phase out unconventional monetary policies: they have secured higher growth, but are still not hitting their target of a 2% annual inflation rate.
One possible explanation for the mysterious combination of stronger growth and low inflation is that, in addition to stronger aggregate demand, developed economies have been experiencing positive supply shocks.
Such shocks may come in many forms.
Globalization keeps cheap goods and services flowing from China and other emerging markets.
Weaker unions and workers’ reduced bargaining power have flattened out the Phillips curve, with low structural unemployment producing little wage inflation.
Oil and commodity prices are low or declining.
And technological innovations, starting with a new Internet revolution, are reducing the costs of goods and services.
Standard economic theory suggests that the correct monetary-policy response to such positive supply shocks depends on their persistence.
If a shock is temporary, central banks should not react to it; they should normalize monetary policy, because eventually the shock will wear off naturally and, with tighter product and labor markets, inflation will rise.
If, however, the shock is permanent, central banks should ease monetary conditions; otherwise, they will never be able to reach their inflation target.
This is not news to central banks.
The Fed has justified its decision to start normalizing rates, despite below-target core inflation, by arguing that the inflation-weakening supply-side shocks are temporary.
Likewise, the ECB is preparing to taper its bond purchases in 2018, under the assumption that inflation will rise in due course.
If policymakers are incorrect in assuming that the positive supply shocks holding down inflation are temporary, policy normalization may be the wrong approach, and unconventional policies should be sustained for longer.
But it may also mean the opposite: if the shocks are permanent or more persistent than expected, normalization must be pursued even more quickly, because we have already reached a “new normal” for inflation.
This is the view taken by the Bank for International Settlements, which argues that it is time to lower the inflation target from 2% to 0% – the rate that can now be expected, given permanent supply shocks.
Trying to achieve 2% inflation in a context of such shocks, the BIS warns, would lead to excessively easy monetary policies, which would put upward pressure on prices of risk assets, and, ultimately, inflate dangerous bubbles.
According to this logic, central banks should normalize policy sooner, and at a faster pace, to prevent another financial crisis.
Most advanced-country central banks don’t agree with the BIS.
They believe that, should asset-price inflation emerge, it can be contained with macroprudential credit policies, rather than monetary policy.
Of course, advanced-country central banks hope such asset inflation won’t appear at all, because inflation is being suppressed by temporary supply shocks, and thus will increase as soon as product and labor markets tighten.
But, faced with the possibility that today’s low inflation may be caused by permanent supply shocks, they are also unwilling to ease more now.
So, even though central banks aren’t willing to give up on their formal 2% inflation target, they are willing to prolong the timeline for achieving it, as they have already done time and again, effectively conceding that inflation may stay low for longer.
Otherwise, they would need to sustain for much longer their unconventional monetary policies, including quantitative easing and negative policy rates – an approach with which most central banks (with the possible exception of the Bank of Japan) are not comfortable.
This central bank patience risks de-anchoring inflation expectations downward.
But continuing for much longer with unconventional monetary policies also carries the risk of undesirable asset-price inflation, excessive credit growth, and bubbles.
As long as uncertainty over the causes of low inflation remains, central banks will have to balance these competing risks.
Central Banks Must Work Together – or Suffer Alone
NEW YORK – Global growth seems to be moving, slowly but surely, along the path to recovery.
The International Monetary Fund’s latest World Economic Outlook predicts 3.5% global growth this year, up from 3.2% last year.
But there’s a hitch: the easy monetary policies that have largely enabled economies to return to growth are reaching their limits, and now threaten to disrupt the recovery by creating the conditions for another financial crisis.
In recent years, the world’s major central banks have pursued unprecedentedly easy monetary policies, including what a recent Deutsche Bank report calls “multi-century all-time lows in interest rates.”
That, together with large-scale quantitative easing, has injected a massive $32 trillion into the global economy over the last nine years.
But these unconventional policies are turning out to be a classic game-theoretic bad equilibrium: each central bank stands to gain by keeping interest rates low, but, collectively, their approach constitutes a trap.
In today’s globalized world, a slight reduction in interest rates by an individual central bank can bring some benefits, beginning with weakening the currency and thus boosting exports.
But the more countries employ this strategy, the greater the strain on the banking sector.
This is already apparent in Europe, where bank equity prices have dropped steadily in recent months.
Moreover, low and especially negative interest rates make holding cash costly, prompting investors to seek riskier investments with higher potential returns.
As a result, collateralized loan obligations (CLOs) have more than doubled this year, reaching an overall market value of $460 billion.
That looks a lot like the surge in collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) that helped to drive the 2008 financial crisis.
While the world has implemented more checks and balances for CLOs than it did for CDOs before the crisis, the trend remains deeply worrying.
Finally, persistently low interest rates can cause people to worry about their retirement funds, spurring them to save more.
Far from boosting consumption, as intended, monetary stimulus may create an environment that dampens demand, weakening prospects for economic growth.
Today, no single country can steer the world away from this trap.
The United States, which might have taken the lead in the past, has ceded its global leadership position in recent years – a process that has been greatly accelerated during the first year of Donald Trump’s presidency.
Moreover, the G20 has lately lost steam in supporting closer coordination of monetary and fiscal policies among the world’s major advanced and emerging economies.
Perhaps a new grouping of the major players – the GMajor? – needs to step up, before it is too late.
To gain the needed motivation, monetary policymakers should recall the “traveler’s dilemma,” a game theory parable that highlights the pitfalls of individual rationality.
The parable features a group of travelers, returning home with identical pottery purchased on a remote island.
Finding that the pottery has been damaged in transit, they demand compensation from the airline.
Because the airline manager – known as the “financial wizard” – has no idea what the price of the pottery is, a creative solution is needed to determine the appropriate amount of compensation.
The manager decides that each traveler should write down the price – any integer from $2 to $100 – without conferring with one another.
If all write the same number, that figure will be understood as the price, and thus the amount of compensation each traveler receives.
If they write different numbers, the lowest number will be taken as the correct price.
Whoever wrote the lowest number would receive an additional $2, as a reward for honesty, while anyone who wrote a higher number would receive $2 less, as a penalty for cheating.
So if some write $80 and some $90, they will receive $82 and $78, respectively, in compensation.
At first blush, the travelers are thrilled.
The pottery has no actual monetary value, but if they each write $100, all can receive $100 in compensation.
One traveler, however, quickly realizes that writing $99 would be a better option, because it would garner that extra $2 reward, and thus a total of $101.
That traveler quickly realizes, however, that others must have had the same idea, and so decides to put down $98 instead.
But what if the others had the same thought?
Better make it $97.
In the end, trapped by this inexorable logic, all travelers end up writing and receiving $2.
The outcome may seem a disaster, but it is also the most rational choice – the “Nash equilibrium” of the traveler’s dilemma game.
It is clear how the financial wizard came by his moniker.
The moral of the story is simple.
The invisible hand of the market does not always lead individually self-interested agents to a collectively desirable outcome.
Altruism and regard for others must play a role.
If they are missing, the players at least need to coordinate their decisions.
Unless central bankers take that message to heart, they will find themselves sweeping up a lot of broken pottery.
The New Monopolists
STANFORD – For more than 30 years in advanced economies, particularly the United States, wealth and income inequality have increased, real (inflation-adjusted) wages have risen slowly, and retirees have faced declining interest rates on savings.
This has occurred while corporate profits and stock prices have risen sharply.
Now, research I have conducted shows that these changes were primarily caused by the rise in modern information technology (IT).
IT has impacted the economy in myriad ways; the computer, the Internet, and mobile technology have transformed media, online retailing, the pharmaceutical industry, and countless other consumer-related services.
IT has improved life enormously.
But, by enabling the rise of monopoly power, and by facilitating barriers to entry, the growth of IT has also had major negative economic, social, and political side effects, including the proliferation of “fake news.”
For starters, the very structure of the IT sector allows for the formation of monopoly power.
IT has improved the processing, storage, and transmission of data, and IT innovators are the sole owners of major information channels that they actively work to prevent competitors from using.
IT firms could defend their monopoly power through patents or by copyrighting intellectual property.
But these routes require making trade secrets public.
So, for strategic reasons, many firms forego legal protections, and consolidate a dominant market position by issuing ongoing software updates that, by default, serve as barriers that are difficult for competitors to breach.
When potential new technologies emerge, bigger firms often acquire their challengers, either to develop the competing technologies on their own, or to suppress them.
Once an innovative firm establishes platform dominance, size becomes an advantage.
Because the cost of processing and storing information has declined in recent years, a firm with a size advantage has smaller operating costs, and profits rise rapidly as the number of users multiplies (Google and Facebook are good examples).
These cost and economies-of-scale advantages are almost impossible for competitors to overcome.
In addition, because these firms derive their power from information, their positions are enhanced by their ability to use their customers’ private information as a strategic asset.
Indeed, many IT platforms are not producers in the traditional sense; they are public utilities that enable coordination and information-sharing among users in diverse fields.
In short, IT enables the creation of barriers to market entry, and then encourages leading firms to become further entrenched.
With the pace of IT innovation increasing, monopoly power is also rising.
In a recent paper measuring the economic effects of monopoly power, I approximated normal levels above which profits or stock values are not purely chance events, but rather reflective of monopoly power.
With these levels, I measured the monopoly component of total stock values – what I call “monopoly wealth” – and of monopoly profits or rent.
I then sought to determine how monopoly wealth and rent have evolved.
The figure below shows monopoly wealth as a percentage of total stock-market value between 1985 and 2015.
As the data show, there was no monopoly wealth in the 1980s.
But as the IT industry developed, monopoly wealth rose dramatically; it reached 82% of total stock-market value – equivalent to some $23.8 trillion – in December 2015.
This is the extra wealth gained by rising monopoly power, and it is continuing to grow.
To put in perspective the percentage of monopoly wealth, consider the related sharp rise in corporate leverage.
In 1960, the percentage of all real corporate assets financed by debt was less than 20%. By 2015, that share had risen to about 80%, meaning that most capital held by public corporations today is owned and traded by bondholders.
In other words, investors have agreed to finance corporate debt by using monopoly wealth as collateral, and most trading in the stock market can therefore be thought of as traded ownership of monopoly wealth.
As the table below shows, nine of the ten firms with the largest monopoly wealth in December 2015 are IT-related, focusing on mobile communications, social media, online retailing, and drugs.
Similarly, most monopoly wealth among the top 100 firms, is being created by companies transformed by IT.
Income created by firms with monopoly power is divided into three types: labor income, normal interest income paid to capital, and monopoly profits.
The data show that in the 1970s and early 1980s, monopoly profits were negligible.
But since 1984, the share of monopoly profits has risen steadily; it reached 23% of total income produced by American corporations in 2015.
This means that during the three decades before 2015, monopoly power caused the combined shares of wages and normal interest on capital to decline by 23%.
Rising productivity and capital accumulation increases wages and capital income, but monopoly power reduces these income shares.
This partly explains why, during the 1985-2015 period, wages exhibited sluggish growth and retirees faced declining interest rates on their savings.
Why, then, has rising monopoly power in the IT sector caused income and wealth to concentrate in fewer hands, leading to an increase in personal income and wealth inequality?
One part of the answer is that rising monopoly power increased corporate profits and sharply boosted stock prices, which produced gains that were enjoyed by a small population of stockholders and corporate management.
But, given that many IT entrepreneurs were young at the start of their careers, with limited ownership of stocks, a more refined explanation is needed.
Since the 1980s, IT innovations have largely been software-based, giving young innovators an advantage.
Additionally, “proof of concept” studies are typically inexpensive for software innovations (except in pharmaceuticals); with modest capital, IT innovators can test ideas without surrendering a major share of their stock. As a result, successful IT innovations have concentrated wealth in fewer – and often younger – hands.
This was not true in the twentieth century, when major innovations in leading sectors such as automobiles required large investments of risk capital.
With more investors needed, the wealth created was distributed more broadly.
The negative side effects of IT are not well understood, and public discussion of how to regulate the sector is urgently needed.
Three considerations are critical.
First, because most technology-based monopoly power does not violate existing antitrust laws, regulating IT will require new measures to weaken monopolies.
New concepts of the public interest are also needed for regulating new public information channels such as social networks.
Second, standard views of business income and wealth taxation will need to be adapted to account for IT firms’ monopoly power.
And, third, laws intended to protect private information should be reevaluated to ensure that IT companies are unable to profit from exploiting and manipulating it.
Above all, the public must develop a deeper understanding of the economic effects of IT, particularly how technologies that have improved the lives of so many are enriching the lives of so few.
Financial Globalization 2.0
WASHINGTON, DC – In the decade since the financial crisis began in August 2007, the contours of global finance have shifted dramatically.
The total value of cross-border capital flows has shrunk by 65% over the last ten years, a decline that reflects, in particular, the sharp reduction in international banking activities.
The question for us is what figures like these can tell us about the health of global finance today.
Are they evidence that “financial globalization” – the international movement of capital – has lurched into reverse?
And if it has, would that be such a bad thing?
The current retrenchment reflects greater risk aversion and awareness since the bubble began to burst in late 2007.
But, according to new research from the McKinsey Global Institute, what is emerging is a more resilient version of global financial integration.
Before the crisis, cross-border banking surged as many of the world’s largest banks expanded internationally, lending more to one another and investing in other foreign assets.
After the creation of the euro, for example, eurozone banks expanded significantly.
Foreign claims held by eurozone banks (and their subsidiaries) soared from $6.6 trillion in 2000 to $23.4 trillion in 2007.
Most important, a majority of that growth was within the eurozone itself, where an integrated European banking market was emerging, leading some to believe that a common currency and shared rules meant country risk had almost disappeared.
What is clear today is that many institutions were simply engaging in herd mentality, rather than executing prudent business strategies.
Then, stung by the financial meltdown in the United States, and subsequently by the eurozone’s own crisis, the major global banks reduced their foreign presence, selling off some businesses, exiting others, and allowing maturing loans to expire.
Since 2007, global banks have sold at least $2 trillion of assets.
Swiss, British, and American banks have all been part of the retreat, but eurozone banks are at its epicenter.
Since the crisis began, eurozone banks have reduced foreign claims by $7.3 trillion, or 45%.
Nearly half of that is a shrinking portfolio among eurozone borrowers, particularly banks.
The perception that lending within the currency area was quasi-domestic has fallen apart.
As the financial crisis evolved, private-sector involvement – through “haircuts” and “bailing in” – became a threatening option.
From a risk perspective, domestic markets – where banks had the advantage of scale and market knowledge – became comparatively more attractive.
In Germany, for example, the ratio of foreign to total assets at the three largest banks flipped, from 65% in 2007 to 33% in 2016.
This was not simply a matter of shrinking the overall balance sheet; domestic assets grew by 70% during the same period.
What has emerged in the eurozone and beyond is a potentially more stable financial system, at least where banking is concerned.
Banks have been required to rebuild their capital, and new rules on liquidity have reduced leverage and vulnerability.
Stress testing and resolution preparedness – the sector’s so-called living wills – have created significant disincentives to complexity.
All of this has made foreign operations less attractive as well.
A more diverse mix of cross-border capital flows also indicates greater stability.
While total annual flows of cross-border lending have fallen by two thirds, foreign direct investment has held up better.
FDI is by far the most stable type of capital flow, reflecting long-term strategic decisions by companies.
Equity-related positions (FDI plus portfolio investments) now account for 69% of cross-border capital flows, up from 36% in 2007.
One final measure of stability is that global imbalances, including aggregate capital- and financial-account balances, are shrinking.
In 2016, these imbalances had fallen to 1.7% of global GDP, from 2.5% in 2007.
Moreover, the remaining deficits and surpluses are spread over a larger number of countries than before the crisis.
In 2005, the US absorbed 67% of global net capital flows.
By 2016, that share had fallen by half.
China, meanwhile, accounted for 16% of the world’s net capital surplus in 2005; last year it was only 1%.
And, with only a few exceptions, like Germany and the Netherlands, imbalances have also declined within the eurozone.
Today, developing countries have become capital importers once more.
None of this should invite complacency.
A more tightly woven global financial system inevitably comes with a higher risk of contagion.
Excesses can always return; indeed, equity and real-estate markets in some advanced economies are rising to new highs, despite mediocre growth prospects.
Volatility in gross capital flows also remains a concern.
Since 2010, one third of developing countries and two thirds of advanced economies have faced large fluctuations in total capital inflows.
Lending flows are particularly unstable; more than 60% of countries have experienced some degree of annual fluctuation, with the median shift equal to 7.7% of GDP for advanced economies, and 3% of GDP for developing countries.
Some observers argue that more should be done to contain risk in the system; to the extent that risk has simply shifted from banks to shadow banks, they may be right.
But, overall, signs of greater resilience and increased stability are everywhere.
Actions taken over the last ten years therefore imply less fragility when the next crisis hits, as it surely will.
Killing Killer Mosquitoes
SINGAPORE – Mosquitoes may be tiny, but they have a powerful bite.
They spread a number of diseases – such as chikungunya, dengue, malaria, yellow fever, West Nile fever, and Zika virus – which together kill millions of people each year. Malaria alone is one of the world’s top infectious killers (behind only tuberculosis and AIDS), responsible for 429,000 deaths in 2015.
Given the scale and scope of the problem, stronger action to eliminate mosquitos – and the diseases they carry – is a development imperative.
The World Health Organization ranks mosquitoes among the top threats to public health, especially in developing countries.
As a graphic on Bill Gates’ blog last year highlighted, mosquitos are responsible for 830,000 human deaths annually – 250,000 more than are caused by our fellow humans.
Beyond the massive human costs, mosquito-borne diseases carry large economic costs.
For an infected individual, those costs include treatment and hospital expenses, transportation to and from a health clinic or hospital, time spent out of work, and insect sprays or bed nets to protect against more disease-spreading mosquito bites.
For countries, mosquito-borne diseases cost millions – even billions – of dollars each year.
Governments must fund mosquito-control and prevention programs, from the use of insecticides to the distribution of mosquito nets, as well as public-education campaigns and vaccination initiatives. (Although there is no widely available vaccine for malaria, three countries are set to take part in a pilot immunization program starting in 2018, and some mosquito-borne diseases – such as yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis, and dengue – are vaccine-preventable.)
Governments may also have to compensate communities affected by epidemics, fund research to treat illness or prevent future outbreaks, cover increased health-care costs, and sustain programs to help patients.
Meanwhile, the economy suffers from reduced productivity.
Eradicating mosquito-transmitted diseases must therefore be a top priority, eliciting not just effective government stewardship, but also the involvement of civil society, private-sector engagement, and the participation of affected communities.
Beyond effective collaboration, success will demand improved surveillance and greater innovation, particularly in diagnostics, drugs and vaccines, insecticides, and vector control.
The good news is that, on vector control – that is, mosquito eradication – promising innovations are already emerging.
One such innovation uses a bacterium called Wolbachia, either to stop deadly viruses from growing or to reduce mosquito populations.
Wolbachia is present in about 60% of species of insects, including some mosquitoes.
One species where Wolbachia is not present naturally is the Aedes aegypti mosquito, which is responsible for transmitting human viruses like dengue, chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika.
Studies show that when Wolbachia is introduced into the Aedes aegypti mosquito, it can prevent the growth of human viruses within the insect.
Another approach would be to release a large number of male mosquitos with the Wolbachia bacteria; females with which they mate would be unable to reproduce.
Another innovation is a vaccine called AGS-v, developed by the London-based pharmaceutical company SEEK to provide broad protection against a range of mosquito-borne diseases.
The vaccine is designed to trigger an immune response to mosquito saliva, thereby preventing infection from whatever virus the saliva contains.
As with Wolbachia, researchers believe that AGS-v could also curb mosquito populations.
After a mosquito takes a blood meal from a vaccinated person, the antibodies may attack the mosquito’s salivary proteins, affecting its ability to feed and to lay eggs – and thereby leading to its premature death.
Phase I clinical trials of the vaccine, sponsored and funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, began in February.
A third innovation is essentially a smart mosquito trap, capable of capturing only the mosquito species capable of spreading the Zika virus and other diseases.
Part of Microsoft’s Project Premonition research initiative, the prototype trap uses an infrared light beam to identify specific mosquito species with more than 80% accuracy.
When the trap captures a mosquito of interest, it saves related data, such as the time, temperature, humidity, and light levels, in order to enhance researchers’ understanding of mosquito behavior and, thus, their ability to address potential outbreaks.
Such innovations promise to accelerate substantially efforts to curb deadly mosquito-borne diseases.
The question is the extent to which they will be applied. After all, far more basic measures that individuals can take to protect themselves and their families are not being implemented nearly enough.
For example, because mosquitos need water to breed, people should be removing puddles or other collections of standing water around their homes, puncturing unused tires, regularly cleaning birdbaths, and draining swimming pools.
Liquid larvicides can be applied directly to water using backpack sprayers, and introducing fish into ponds, particularly in residential areas, can also help to eliminate larvae.
As for adult mosquitoes, keeping grass and shrubs short limits resting places, thereby helping to control populations.
Window and door screens should be installed and maintained, and the outdoors should be avoided in the morning and evening, when mosquitos tend to be most active.
Long-sleeve shirts, long pants, and insect repellants can help minimize bites when staying inside isn’t an option.
But people need to use them. And, for that, information must be shared widely, and the relevant tools made available to the public.
Last month marked the 120th anniversary of the discovery that female mosquitoes transmit malaria among humans.
Since then, malaria and other mosquito-borne diseases have been controlled and even eliminated in the developed world.
Yet, in developing countries, the fight is far from over.
The Shape of Charges to Come?
WASHINGTON, DC – When the news broke last week about the specific documents sought by Robert Mueller, the special counsel heading the federal investigation into Russia’s role in the 2016 election and whether Donald Trump’s campaign colluded with the Kremlin, a chill fell over Trump’s already jittery White House.
The documents to be turned over covered some familiar events that could well lead to Trump being charged with obstruction of justice, or might show that his campaign was, at the very least, interested in playing with the Russians.
The possible or even likely obstruction charge would derive from Trump’s various efforts to block the investigation.
In particular, Trump asked FBI director James Comey to go easy in his investigation of retired General Michael Flynn, the former national security adviser whom Trump reluctantly fired, ostensibly because he had lied to Vice President Mike Pence about the nature of post-election telephone calls with the Russian ambassador.
Pence then reassured the country that Flynn and the ambassador had simply exchanged small talk, such as Christmas greetings.
In fact, they had discussed the possibility of Trump lifting sanctions that outgoing President Barack Obama had imposed on Russia as punishment for its interference in the election.
Mueller no doubt wants to know if Trump was aware of or consented to Flynn’s discussions.
Trump also asked senior US intelligence figures to try to convince Comey to go easy on Flynn.
One mystery is why Trump was so anxious to protect Flynn.
Does Flynn have compromising information about the president?
Then there was Trump’s firing of Comey in May, followed by misleading statements from White House aides regarding why he had done so.
But then Trump blurted out in a television interview that when he fired Comey, he had in mind “this Russia thing.”
The next day, at a meeting in the Oval Office, Trump told senior Russian officials that firing Comey had relieved “great pressure” on him.
It’s definitely not a good idea, as Richard Nixon learned during the Watergate scandal, for a president to fire his own investigator.
Trump’s firing of Comey saddled him with Mueller, a former FBI director in Democratic and Republican administrations, praised by politicians in both parties for his integrity.
Trump is just one of the people at risk of criminal charges as a result of Mueller’s investigation.
Others in Mueller’s sights are Trump’s former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, and Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner.
Kushner and his wife, Ivanka Trump (said to be the president’s favorite child), have offices in the White House, and Kushner is involved in an absurdly broad array of issues, from resolving the Israel-Palestine conflict to reorganizing the federal government.
Mueller has hired experts on financial crime – an ominous development for other targets.
While Mueller is investigating Kushner’s campaign activities, he is also understood to be taking a close look at Kushner’s immense real estate business.
A few years ago, Kushner and his father bought the most expensive building in New York City, 666 Fifth Avenue, leaving them enormously indebted and unable to finance the mortgage.
Jared Kushner’s eagerness to secure the large sums needed to stay afloat has led him to seek foreign lenders, including a Russian banker close to Vladimir Putin.
Mueller is also known to be putting the squeeze on Manafort, a lobbyist and political consultant with a history of helping dictators.
One of his most infamous clients was the pro-Russian Viktor Yanukovych, who, upon winning the presidency of Ukraine, imprisoned his main rival, the previous prime minister, on trumped-up charges.
Mueller’s team is poring over Manafort’s business dealings – projects around the world, debts, funds stashed in foreign tax shelters, suspected money laundering, and more.
To put pressure on Manafort, Mueller even staged a pre-dawn raid on his home in northern Virginia and let him know that he’ll be indicted – presumably to persuade him to give up information about Trump.
Although Manafort was dropped from the Trump campaign last August, following embarrassing news stories about his work in Ukraine, Trump, acting against the advice of aides, continued to talk with Manafort into the early months of his presidency.
Also, it was recently revealed that in 2016, while Manafort was still campaign chair, he offered to conduct briefings for a Russian oligarch about the presidential campaign.
Campaign chairs are usually too busy for such a task.
Mueller obviously hopes to “flip” both Flynn and Manafort.
And the president’s son, Donald Trump Jr., is also at risk in the sprawling scandal.
Of particular interest to Mueller is a meeting held in Trump Tower in June 2016, between the Trump campaign’s top brass and a Russian lawyer with close Kremlin ties, who had offered Donald Jr. some dirt on Hillary Clinton, a prospect that excited the candidate’s son.
(“I love it,” he emailed in response.)
Donald Jr. first described the meeting as having been a discussion about adoptions of Russian babies by Americans (which Russian President Vladimir Putin banned in 2012).
In fact, there had been a discussion of the sanctions and other matters of interest to Russia.
Though Kushner and Donald Jr. said nothing came of the meeting, that has not been established.
Mueller is also interested in Trump’s role in crafting, on Air Force One on his way back from Europe, a statement that once again misled the public about what was discussed at the Trump Tower meeting with the Russians.
For more than a year, Trump has been adamant that he has no business interests in Russia and has received no loans from the country.
But his softness toward Putin remains puzzling.
Recently, it was discovered that Trump’s business had been trying to build an enormous Trump Tower in Moscow, an effort that continued into his candidacy, before being dropped for lack of permits and land.
The attention paid to Mueller’s Russia investigation waxes and wanes in Washington, DC.
But the inquiry won’t stop until Mueller is satisfied that he knows all he needs to know.
Murder Unincorporated
NEW YORK – What possessed the young French Muslim Mohammed Merah to murder three Jewish schoolchildren, a rabbi, and three soldiers, two of them fellow Muslims?
What possessed another man, Anders Breivik, to gun down more than 60 teenagers in a Norwegian summer camp last year?
These murder sprees are so unusual that people demand explanations.
To call these killers “monsters,” as some were quick to do, sheds little light on the problem.
They were not monsters; they were young men.
And to dismiss them as madmen is equally evasive.
If they were clinically insane, nothing more would need to be explained.
Two accounts, both broadly socio-political, stand out. One was put forward by the controversial Muslim activist Tariq Ramadan.
He blames French society. More specifically, he blames the fact that young Frenchmen of Muslim origin are marginalized on the grounds of their faith and the color of their skin.
Even though these people have French passports, they are treated as unwanted foreigners.
When French President Nicolas Sarkozy, himself the son of immigrants, says that there are too many foreigners in France, he drives young men like Merah farther into a corner.
A tiny minority of such men might lash out in desperation.
The other explanation, favored by Sarkozy, takes Merah at his word.
He said that he was protesting French military operations in Muslim countries and avenging the killing of Palestinian children.
He wanted to bring down the French state as an Islamic holy warrior.
He was inspired by al-Qaeda.
So why not believe him?
Hence Sarkozy’s decision to arrest other Muslim men suspected of Islamic extremism and bar certain imams from attending a religious conference in France.
Those who view Islamic extremism as the problem also tend to hold up young killers like Merah as examples of failed integration.
They never became sufficiently French. Immigrants must be forced to share “Western values.”
Although no one would argue that Anders Breivik is insufficiently Norwegian, he, too, could be taken at his word.
The rhetoric of xenophobic demagogues appears to have convinced him that he had to kill the children of the social-democratic elites in order to protect Western civilization against the dangers of multiculturalism and Islam.
His murders were the extreme result of dangerous ideas.
Neither explanation is entirely wrong.
Many young Muslims feel unwanted in their countries of birth, and extreme language, whether used by Islamists or their opponents, helps to create an atmosphere conducive to violence.
But both Ramadan and Sarkozy are too simplistic, for they reduce extraordinary murders to single explanations.
Even when they are faced with rejection, most young Muslim men do not become mass murderers.
Merah is too anomalous to serve as a typical example of anything, including racial or religious discrimination.
Far from being a religious fanatic, Merah grew up as a petty criminal with no interest in religion.
The appeal of Islamist extremism may have been its glorification of violence more than any religious content.
He enjoyed watching jihadist videos of beheadings.
He also tried to join the French army and the Foreign Legion.
The army turned him down because of his criminal record. If the French wouldn’t have him, he would join the holy warriors: anything to give him a sense of power and an excuse to indulge his violent impulses.
Many young men are drawn to the fantasy of violence; far fewer feel the need to act it out.
Ideology can serve as an excuse or justification, but it is rarely the main source of individual acts of brutality.
Murder sprees are more often than not a form of personal revenge – losers wishing to blow up the world around them, because they feel humiliated or rejected, whether socially, professionally, or sexually.
Sometimes, the killers appear to lack any excuse at all, as in the case of Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, who in 1999 shot 12 fellow-students and a teacher at their high school in Columbine, Colorado.
In that case, people blamed the sadistic video games and movies that the killers had been watching.
Still, most enthusiasts of this type of entertainment do not actually go out and kill people.
Breivik had fantasies of being a knight fighting the enemies of the West. Merah imagined that he was a jihadi.
Who knows what the Columbine killers thought they were doing. But the reasons why they killed lie within them, and cannot be principally attributed to the entertainment or other materials that they consumed.
Banning such materials has an aesthetic appeal, to be sure, and public figures who preach violence should always be condemned.
Hate speech and violent ideology are not irrelevant.
But to make too much of them in cases such as those of Merah or Breivik can be misleading.
Censorship is unlikely to solve the problem.
Banning Hitler’s Mein Kampf or forbidding the display of Nazi symbols has not stopped neo-Nazis in Germany from murdering immigrants.
Suppressing violent pornography will not get rid of rapists or high-school killers.
Preventing demagogues from ranting about Muslims or multi-culturalists will not deter a future Anders Breivik.
And barring radical imams from entering France won’t stop another Merah from going on a murderous rampage.
In fact, to compare Merah’s savage deeds to the killings of September 11, 2001, as Sarkozy has done, is to give the killer too much credit.
There is no evidence that he is part of any organized group, or in the vanguard of a revolutionary movement.
Using his case to stoke fear of an Islamic threat to society might make electoral sense for Sarkozy.
But provoking fear is seldom the best recipe for avoiding further violence. On the contrary, it is more likely to fuel it.
ASEAN and the Rohingya Crisis
DHAKA – The worsening plight of Muslim Rohingya communities in Myanmar’s Rakhine state could soon imperil the country’s government, as well as the reputation of its leader, the Nobel Peace Prize laureate Daw Aung San Suu Kyi.
The crisis has been escalating since last October, when Myanmar’s military launched an offensive in which 130 Rohingya were killed, and dozens of their buildings were torched.
At the time, the military’s leaders claimed that the attack was part of an effort to locate unidentified insurgents who were thought to be responsible for the slayings on October 9 of nine policemen at three border posts in the district of Maungdaw.
According to a Human Rights Watch analysis of satellite images, still more Rohingya villages were destroyed over the course of nine days in November, bringing the number of buildings razed to 1,250; meanwhile, 30,000 people have reportedly been displaced.
The United Nations considers the stateless Rohingya to be among the world’s most persecuted minorities.
Now, other countries in an otherwise stable region are becoming embroiled in the crisis; indeed, countries such as Bangladesh, Thailand, and Indonesia are increasingly feeling the spillover effects, as Rohingya seek asylum within their borders.
The persecution of the Rohingya can no longer be described as merely a domestic problem for Myanmar.
ASEAN has been criticized for approaching the Rohingya issue too cautiously, and for failing to recognize that the ongoing conflict could divide the bloc along ethno-religious lines.
The region’s population is 60% Muslim, 18% Buddhist, and 17% Christian; continued discrimination against the Rohingya already has become a rallying cry for sympathetic Islamic extremist groups in countries that provide asylum.
This is an especially grave risk for Muslim-majority countries such as Indonesia.
The fleeing Rohingya live in deplorable conditions when they reach host countries, and they have been involved in chronic skirmishes with security forces.
Facing constant struggle and ongoing food shortages, the Rohingya are prime targets for terrorist recruiting.
Not surprisingly, Islamic extremist groups have already posted online videos calling for jihad against Myanmar; and Indonesian authorities recently arrested two militants who were allegedly plotting an attack on Myanmar’s embassy in Jakarta.
As the Rohingya crisis deepens, more regional and international extremist groups will undoubtedly use it as a convenient tool to gain sympathy, recruit new members, and raise funds.
ASEAN leaders must formulate an effective diplomatic solution to the crisis to prevent it from fueling more extremism in the region and disrupting trade and people’s livelihoods.
The much-heralded “ASEAN Way,” whereby member states adhere to quiet diplomacy and principled non-intervention, served the bloc well on the economic front in its first decades of existence.
But as international criticism mounts, the ineffectiveness of a “see no evil, hear no evil” strategy for addressing internal issues should now be obvious.
Malaysia seems to recognize this.
At the recent ASEAN foreign ministers’ meeting in Yangon, it called for the coordination of humanitarian aid and an investigation into alleged atrocities committed against Rohingya.
Following the meeting, Myanmar showed willingness to grant humanitarian access and to keep the ASEAN members informed.
It is time for ASEAN to heed this call, shifting its mode of operation, so that mature democracies such as Singapore and Malaysia – which rank high in human-development indices – can become responsible global leaders, and expand their humanitarian problem-solving capacities.
ASEAN needs to grow into a strong, politically accountable, European Union-style community.
To do that, it must find peaceful yet effective ways to mitigate what is now a regional humanitarian crisis.
According to unofficial estimates, there could now be as many as 500,000 Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh alone.
Since the latest military intervention, another 20,000 Rohingya have arrived.
This puts Bangladesh, which already struggles to provide basic services to its own 170 million citizens, in an extremely difficult position.
Already, Myanmar’s Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs has visited Dhaka for talks.
And a three-member team of Myanmar’s Advisory Commission on Rakhine State visited the Rohingya slums in Bangladesh’s coastal area bordering Rakhine state.
ASEAN could help here.
Member states such as Singapore enjoy friendly relations with both Myanmar and Bangladesh, and thus could provide a platform for the two countries to come together and arrive at permanent solutions to a decades-old problem.
But first ASEAN must decide to pull its political weight, and to expend some of its political capital, to bring about a just, long-term settlement.
If it does, it can serve as an honest broker between Myanmar, Bangladesh, and, most importantly, representatives of the Rohingya community, who have suffered persecution for long enough.
Five Steps to Peace in Myanmar
CANBERRA – The humanitarian crisis afflicting Myanmar’s Muslim Rohingya has damaged the country’s political stability and shattered its image as a country moving toward democracy.
Moreover, it has tarnished the reputation of the government’s de facto leader, the Nobel Peace Prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi; called into question the crisis-management credentials of ASEAN and the United Nations; and made a mockery of international institutions for conflict prevention.
And yet, for all the woe, a resolution remains possible; to achieve it, five steps must be taken without delay.
First and foremost, the killings and atrocities must stop, which will be as difficult as it is necessary.
Myanmar’s military has engaged in a sustained campaign of ethnic cleansing, with the primary goal of expelling the Rohingya from the country.
Although these actions cannot be undone, further bloodshed and targeted evictions can and should cease.
For that to happen, however, Rohingya extremists must be contained.
Contrary to the prevailing narrative in the West, the Myanmar military was provoked, after insurgents staged a series of attacks on police and army posts in August.
Exploiting a history of armed clashes between Buddhists and Muslims in Rakhine State, the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) has assumed leadership of an increasingly violent campaign.
The problem, of course, has been the disproportionate use of force by the military, which retaliated against ARSA strikes by launching a scorched-earth campaign that has killed as many as 3,000.
Soldiers have burned entire Rohingya villages, engaged in sexual violence, destroyed mosques, and provoked mass displacement.
The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein, says it is “a textbook example of ethnic cleansing,” while UN Secretary-General António Guterres has called the crisis “catastrophic.”
Suu Kyi, meanwhile, has failed to exercise any moral authority, sounding instead like an apologist when she insists that “a huge iceberg of misinformation” is “promoting the interest of the terrorists.”
She is, no doubt, sandwiched between an autonomous military that retains complete control over the country’s security services, and a Buddhist-majority population with deeply rooted anti-Muslim prejudices.
But, that predicament does not excuse her failure to condemn what is happening under her watch.
To be sure, Suu Kyi’s government resents the idealistic but partisan statements often issued by Western leaders and UN representatives.
Rohingya extremists have long-established links with foreign jihadists, including those of the Islamic State.
Complicating the military’s position, ARSA is, according to the International Crisis Group, commanded by Saudi-based insurgents with extensive experience in guerrilla warfare.
Few Westerners grasp the challenges faced by decision-makers in developing countries confronting extremism from insurgents and terrorists.
It is precisely these concerns that have made it difficult for Myanmar to break the cycle of violence.
Bangladesh and India have refused to resettle Rohingya refugees permanently, largely because they fear that jihadists could be among them.
Indian intelligence agencies have linked ARSA to the Pakistani jihadist group Lashkar-e-Taiba.
Similarly, China’s government has supported Myanmar’s efforts to protect its national security.
As part of its Belt and Road Initiative, China is investing $7.3 billion in a port project in Rakhine, which may lead China to block any attempt in the UN Security Council to censure Myanmar for its actions.
This tangled web of interests, coupled with the government’s failure, means that responsibility for protecting all of Myanmar’s people now falls to ASEAN or the UN.
Once hostilities cease, the second step toward ensuring long-term peace will be the repatriation of refugees, which could prove to be a logistical nightmare.
According to UN figures, at the end of September some 700,000 Rohingya refugees had crossed into Bangladesh, with more than half arriving since late August.
And Myanmar’s military has mined the border with Bangladesh to stop them from returning.
Assuming that the issues of violence and refugees can be addressed, Myanmar must grant international humanitarian access to the affected regions.
ASEAN, which demonstrated its capabilities in the wake of Cyclone Nargis in 2008, is well positioned to take the lead in shaping a regional response.
ASEAN could also coordinate with the UN in managing emergency personnel.
The fourth step is to hold enablers of the atrocities accountable.
Myanmar’s government must undertake – or permit ASEAN or the UN to do so on its behalf – an independent and impartial investigation into the killings, identify the perpetrators, and subject them to transparent and credible prosecution.
If this cannot be done domestically, the matter must be referred to the International Criminal Court.
Finally, the government that Suu Kyi leads must repeal or amend all discriminatory laws and end official anti-Rohingya discrimination.
With 1.1 million members, the Rohingya are one of the world’s largest stateless ethnic groups.
Most came to Myanmar as part of the expansion of the British Empire, after the Burmese king was defeated in 1826, but are still considered to be illegal Bengali immigrants.
The 1982 citizenship law did not recognize them as one of the country’s 135 ethnic groups, and they have severely limited access to health care, education, and employment, in addition to facing restrictions on their freedom of movement.
Myanmar’s democratic transition remains fragile, with civil-military relations, poverty, economic growth, and governance competing for attention.
But the cessation of hostilities and resolution of the Rohingya crisis must take precedence.
The report issued in August by the Rakhine Advisory Commission, led by former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan, offers one possible path forward.
These five steps will not heal all wounds or end every grievance.
But they can help ease the suffering by discouraging further atrocities, deterring violent extremism, and improving border security.
At the moment, this may be the best-possible outcome.
Nationalists and Globalists
WASHINGTON, DC – The Dutch election was the first bright spot in a while for people in Europe and the United States who are deeply worried that the backlash against globalization will bring even more white “Judeo-Christian” nationalist parties to power.
Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte defeated the anti-Islam candidate Geert Wilders, who has called for closing Dutch borders, shutting mosques, and banning the Koran.
The standard way of describing political forces ranging from Viktor Orbán’s Fidesz party in Hungary to Marine Le Pen’s National Front in France to Donald Trump’s supporters in the United States is “populist.”
Populism means a politics of the people, juxtaposed against a politics of the elites.
But in the US at least, Trump’s ideology – which has little to do with traditional Republican conservatism – frames the axis of division not as the many versus the few, but as nationalists versus globalists.
In the first issue of American Affairs, a new conservative journal dedicated to “exploring the true content of our common citizenship,” Georgetown University Professor Joshua Mitchell writes that for “several generations conservatives have thought that the domestic enemy was progressivism.
Now they imagine they face a new problem: populism.”
In fact, Mitchell argues, what is really happening is not a mass movement of the people, but a “revolt in the name of national sovereignty.”A revolt in the name of a connected nation, of citizens connected to one another, to their “towns, cities, states, and nation.”
As Mitchell depicts it, theirs is a grounded nationalism, rooted in the wealth of voluntary associations that Alexis de Tocqueville identified as the American antidote to the abstract rational universalism of both the French and the American revolutions.
The key point here is the relationship between borders, culture, and connection.
By maintaining sovereignty at the national rather than the global level, borders can be defended and communities defined and maintained.
If those borders dissolve, what binds human beings to one another is no longer their community or their common cultures, but only their identity.
Thus, Mitchell argues, globalism and identity politics go together, and both are detached from national identity.
Being labeled a rootless globalist is always dangerous, as the Jewish people know all too well.
The leading Soviet anti-Semitic slur was “rootless cosmopolitan,” a term used to refer to Jewish intellectuals and one that Vladimir Putin would be perfectly comfortable with today as he revives a Russian nationalism based on the Russian Orthodox Church, Mother Russia, and Slavic peasant culture.
Back in the US, many Trump supporters also excoriate globalists for what they experience as sneering disdain.
They rage against what they perceive as the moral sanctimony – indeed the righteousness – of the left.
Sam Altman, the CEO of a prestigious start-up incubator in Silicon Valley, spent several months after the presidential election traveling across the US and talking to Trump voters.
When the conversation turned to the reactions of the left to Trump’s victory, many of his interlocutors argued that “the left is more intolerant than the right.”
Altman observes that this view “came up a lot, with real animosity in otherwise pleasant conversations.”
He quotes one person saying, “Stop calling us racists.
Stop calling us idiots.
We aren’t.
Listen to us when we try to tell you why we aren’t.
Oh, and stop making fun of us.”
That perceived combination of arrogance and ridicule fans irritation into rage and revenge fantasies.
Current White House advisers have a similar reaction.
A new profile of Kellyanne Conway, Trump’s campaign manager turned White House counselor, notes that she has not “forgotten how people treated her back when they thought she was a sure loser.
Their attitude wasn’t one of outright rudeness or contempt; it was so much worse than that.
It was syrupy condescension—the smarmy, indulgent niceness of people who think they’re better than you.”
So much of higher education is about learning how to question and manage emotion.
First-year law school students in the US learn how to suppress their natural intuitions of justice – a defective car caused an accident that injured a child severely; surely the manufacturer should pay – in favor of carefully reasoned analysis of the costs and benefits to society as a whole.
That training often means that highly educated “elites,” who socialize primarily with one another, either forget or willfully ignore the role of emotion in politics – except to the extent that campaign consultants produce an endless supply of gauzy “feel-good” political commercials.
Feelings of being disconnected and despised, however, are powerful emotions, strong enough to twist facts into a dark alternate reality.
It is critical to look beyond a simple story of populism, of masses versus elites.
A narrative of grounded, connected nationalism versus sanctimonious free-floating globalism is one that will generate support and staying power even among many well-educated people.
The right response is not to deny the existence or legitimacy of a desire to stay grounded amid tumultuous change, or love of country and culture, much less to look down on the less educated.
It is to build a new narrative of patriotism, culture, connection, and inclusion.
Even if Wilders lost this month and Le Pen loses in May, they and their supporters will not be going away.
The Sovereignty that Really Matters
MADRID – In his famous “political trilemma of the world economy,” Harvard economist Dani Rodrik boldly claims that global economic integration, the nation-state, and democracy cannot coexist.
At best, we can combine two of the three, but always at the expense of one.
Until recently, the so-called Washington Consensus, with its emphasis on liberalization, deregulation, and privatization, shaped economic policy worldwide.
While the 2008 global financial crisis eroded its credibility, the G20 countries quickly agreed to avoid the protectionist policies against which the consensus stood.
Meanwhile, the European Union remained (and remains) the only democratic experiment on a supranational level, taking pride in its promising advances, despite being burdened by multiple defects.
In other words, economic integration, anchored in the nation-state, remained in favor globally, while democracy was made secondary to international market dynamics.
But 2016 marked a turning point, though we still do not know toward what.
A “Beijing Consensus” has emerged, which some view as an alternative model of development based on greater government intervention.
But it was the Brexit vote and the election of Donald Trump as US president that really reflected the move to upend the long-established balance among globalization, the nation-state, and democracy.
“Let’s take back control” was the Brexiteers’ winning slogan, expressing a sentiment that clearly resonated with the slim majority of British voters who supported withdrawal from the EU.
Likewise, many Trump voters were convinced that the accumulated powers of Wall Street, transnational players, and even other countries had to be reined in to “make America great again.”
It would not be wise to scorn this diagnosis, to which Rodrik himself subscribes (at least in part), just because one dislikes the proposals put forward by Trump and some of the Conservative proponents of Brexit.
Their approach consists in hindering globalization – while maintaining or even enhancing other aspects of the Washington Consensus, such as financial deregulation – and strengthening democracy through the nation-state.
In his first appearance before the United Nations General Assembly, Trump delivered a 42-minute speech in which he used the words “sovereignty” or “sovereign” 21 times –an average of once every two minutes.
And in Europe, the United Kingdom is not the only country to be carried away by a neo-Westphalian current: Poland and Hungary are in its grip as well.
Even the Catalan pro-independence movement, headed by various parties, most of which would not feel comfortable being labeled “anti-globalization,” follows a similar logic of retreat into nationalism.
All of these forces overestimate their capacity to dilute or circumvent existing economic integration, which has been strengthened in recent decades by the rapid development of cross-border value chains.
Unless these forces reverse course, they are more likely to dilute the influence that their nation-states (or the states they seek to create) might be able to wield over globalization.
In short, an increase in formal sovereignty could paradoxically result in a loss of effective sovereignty, which is the kind that really matters.
Consider Britain: by exiting the EU, the British will have no say over what is, far and away, their most important export market.
As for Catalonia, a supposedly pro-independence and pro-sovereignty movement could end up creating a polity that is less sovereign and more at the mercy of international events.
Just a week after Trump’s UN speech, French President Emmanuel Macron presented his vision of Europe’s future in an address at the Sorbonne.
Macron also mentioned the word “sovereign” repeatedly, making it clear that it forms the basis of his vision for Europe.
But, unlike populists, he favors an effective and inclusive sovereignty, European in scope and supported by two more key pillars: unity and democracy.
Relations between states are driven by cooperation, competition, and confrontation.
There is little doubt that a certain degree of confrontation will always be present internationally.
But the EU has clearly demonstrated that its incidence can be reduced by exponentially increasing the opportunity cost of conflictive dynamics.
Unfortunately, the movements that understand sovereignty in isolationist terms usually revert to extreme nationalism, which is not given to promoting the common spaces that allow international society to prosper.
The preference of some countries to isolate themselves within their borders is anachronistic and self-defeating, but it would be a serious mistake for others, fearing contagion, to respond by avoiding engagement with these states.
The spirit of cooperation, along with constructive competition, should structure relations between all players that possess international legitimacy.
Even in states that have succumbed to reductionist discourses, much of the population has not.
Such is the case of the 48% of British voters who opposed Brexit, or the 49% of Turks who voted “no” to expanding the Turkish presidency’s powers, implicitly rejecting a narrative that used the EU as a scapegoat.
Many of these voters would surely be disappointed if the EU turned its back on them.
The vitality of international society depends on dialogue.
And, to avoid perpetuating the deficiencies of the Washington Consensus, which were revealed with such clarity in 2016, this dialogue must occur within the framework of a common and democratic public sphere.
If we cultivate this common public sphere, reducing the pre-eminence of the nation-state, we could advance step by step toward the least explored side of the triad described by Rodrik: global democracy.
Of course, a universal democracy would be a very difficult objective to achieve (Rodrik himself rules it out).
But, with technological development and the multiplication of economic and cultural synapses, it is not a chimera.
In this sense, the EU has already forged a new path, one that aims to expand democracy beyond the realm of the nation-state.
For Europe, as well as for other regions, it is a path worth following.
The New Xenophobia
OXFORD – Democratic governments in the West are increasingly losing their bearings.
From the shift toward illiberalism in Poland and Hungary to the Brexit vote in the United Kingdom and Donald Trump’s victory in the United States’ presidential election, a particularly lethal strain of populism is infecting societies – and it is spreading.
The appeal of populism is straightforward.
Faced with stagnant wages and a declining quality of life, people feel frustrated – all the more so when their leaders keep telling them that things are getting better.
Then the populist appears and promises to shake things up, to defend the interests of the “people” (though really only some of them), and offers something arguably more attractive than feasible solutions: scapegoats.
At the top of the list of scapegoats are the “elites” – established political parties and corporate leaders.
Rather than protecting the “people” from economic pressure and insecurity, this group, the populist declares, thrives on the people’s pain.
By advancing globalization – by forcing ever-more openness down the people’s throat – they have accumulated massive wealth, which they then protect through tax avoidance, offshoring, and other schemes.
But it is not just the elites who are blamed.
Yes, they have betrayed the people.
But one way they do so is by foisting upon the people equal rights and opportunities for minorities, immigrants, and foreigners, who “steal” jobs, threaten national security, and undermine traditional ways of life.
Trump won the US presidency partly because of his pledges to deport millions of undocumented immigrants and ban Muslims from entering the country.
The Brexiteers promised to end free immigration from the European Union.
After the vote, Britain’s Home Secretary Amber Rudd suggested that firms hiring foreigners should be named and shamed.
Today’s populism advances a toxic new xenophobia, one that threatens to fracture our societies.
For politicians, it offers an easy means of quickly transforming people’s fear and powerlessness into an intoxicating mix of anger and authority.
It persuades intimidated (often elderly) voters that, in the parlance of the Brexiteers, they can “take back control” of their lives and their countries, primarily by rejecting foreigners.
Demography makes the new xenophobia particularly dangerous.
In much of the West, societies are becoming increasingly diverse.
Hispanics now account for 17.6% of the US population.
One-third of Londoners were born outside the UK.
In France, an estimated 10% of the population is Muslim.
And an estimated 20% of Germany’s population have some immigrant background.
In this context, when politicians campaign for votes by advancing antagonistic and divisive identity politics, they sow the seeds of animosity, mistrust, and violence within their own societies.
When candidates repeatedly call Muslims dangerous, for example, no one should be surprised by a surge in anti-Muslim hate crimes, as has occurred in the wake of both the Brexit vote and Trump’s victory.
Such divided societies require a rising level of coercion and force to control.
Diversity should be a strength, one that helps societies to flourish.
That is why it is so important to combat the new xenophobia.
One way is by encouraging and enabling social mixing, interaction, and deliberation among diverse groups.
Extensive psychological research shows that intergroup contact reduces people’s sense of threat, heightening the possibilities for building trust across society.
If community centers, schools, and public locations are places where people of different religions, cultures, and race meet, xenophobia is less likely to take root.
Even living in an area where others mix can help.
This is why the new xenophobia has largely been resisted in Europe’s most diverse cities.
A second way to combat the new xenophobia is to reinforce the protection of civil liberties.
This means upholding the rule of law, even in the face of terrorist threats, and ensuring the independence of judges.
Yet, lately, there have been ominous moves in the opposite direction.
Leaders in Hungary and Poland have been dismantling constitutional protections; France has used a lengthy state of emergency to suspend rights; and British and American politicians have publicly denigrated judges.
Democracy was toppled by xenophobes in the 1930s not because of the strength of the anti-democratic parties, but because of democratic leaders’ failure to uphold their countries’ constitutions.
A third way to fight the new xenophobia is through innovation.
For example, though the Internet is often viewed as a great equalizer, social media are contributing to fragmentation.
The content to which people are exposed is filtered, whether through self-selection or algorithms.
The result is echo chambers in which like-minded people reinforce shared convictions, creating increasingly polarized silos.
But, if social media platforms were reconfigured in innovative ways, they could have the opposite impact, creating spaces for citizens from diverse backgrounds to interact.
The threat posed by the new xenophobia should not be underestimated.
Today, no less than in the past, the rejection of diversity is tantamount to the rejection of democracy.
That is why it must be defended, before its opponents gain any more ground.
The Myth of Net-Zero Emissions
BERLIN – The emissions from burning coal, oil, and gas are heating up our planet at such a rapid rate that increasingly volatile and dangerous climate conditions seem almost inevitable.
Clearly, we have to reduce emissions fast, while developing alternative energy sources that allow us to leave fossil fuels in the ground.
This imperative is almost shockingly straightforward.
Yet climate change has been subject to so much political inertia, false information, and wishful thinking for the last few decades that we continue to see ineffective or impossible solutions, rather than an effort to address root causes.
Often these “solutions” are based on non-existent or risky new technologies.
This approach is highly expedient, for it threatens neither business as usual nor socioeconomic orthodoxy.
But climate models that depend on elusive technologies weaken the imperative to enact the deep structural changes that are needed to avoid climate catastrophe.
The latest such “solution” to emerge is “net-zero emissions,” which depends on so-called “carbon capture and storage.”
Though the technology still faces more than a few shortcomings, Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Chairman Rajendar Pachauri issued a deeply problematic statement last month, saying that, “With CCS it is entirely possible for fossil fuels to continue to be used on a large scale.”
To be fair, the IPCC’s latest assessment report highlights the imperative of cutting CO2 emissions drastically to avoid exceeding the world’s small – and still risky – carbon budget.
But to shift from clear-cut goals like “zero emissions,” “full decarbonization,” and “100% renewable energy” to the far hazier objective of net-zero emissions is to adopt a dangerous stance.
Indeed, the net-zero idea implies that the world can continue to produce emissions, as long as there is a way to “offset” them.
So, instead of embarking immediately on a radical emissions-reduction trajectory, we can continue to emit massive amounts of CO2 – and even establish new coal plants – while claiming to be taking climate action by “supporting” the development of CCS technology.
It is apparently irrelevant that such technology might not work, is riddled with practical challenges, and carries the risk of future leakage, which would have major social and environmental consequences.
Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage is the poster child for the new “overshoot approach” of net-zero emissions.
BECCS entails planting a huge amount of grass and trees, burning the biomass to generate electricity, capturing the CO2 that is emitted, and pumping it into geological reservoirs underground.
BECCS would have enormous development implications, provoking large-scale land grabs, most likely from relatively poor people.
This is not some farfetched scenario; rising demand for biofuels has spurred devastating land grabs in developing countries for many years.
It would take a lot more land to offset a substantial share of CO2 emissions.
Indeed, an estimated 218-990 million hectares would have to be converted to switchgrass to sequester one billion tons of carbon using BECCS.
That is 14-65 times the amount of land the United States uses to grow corn for ethanol.
Nitrous-oxide emissions from the vast amount of fertilizer that would be required to grow the switchgrass could be enough to exacerbate climate change.
Then there are the CO2 emissions from producing synthetic fertilizers; clearing trees, shrubs, and grass from hundreds of millions of hectares of land; destroying large reservoirs of soil carbon; and transporting and processing the switchgrass.
Even more problematic is the revelation that CCS and BECCS would most likely be used for “enhanced oil recovery,” with compressed CO2 pumped into old oil wells for storage, thereby creating a financial incentive to recover more oil.
The US Department of Energy estimates that such methods could make 67 billion barrels of oil – three times the volume of proven US oil reserves – economically recoverable.
Indeed, given the money at stake, enhanced oil recovery could actually be one of the motives behind the push for CCS.
In any case, no form of CCS advances the goal of a structural shift toward full decarbonization, which is what social movements, academics, ordinary citizens, and even some politicians are increasingly demanding.
They are prepared to accept the inconveniences and sacrifices that will arise during the transition; indeed, they view the challenge of creating a zero-carbon economy as an opportunity to renew and improve their societies and communities.
Dangerous, elusive, and pie-in-the-sky technologies have no place in such an effort.
A clear understanding of the climate crisis expands the range of potential solutions considerably.
For example, by banning new coal plants and shifting fossil-fuel subsidies toward the financing of renewable energy through feed-in tariffs, sustainable energy could be brought to billions of people worldwide, while reducing fossil-fuel dependency.
While such innovative and practical solutions are prevented from being scaled up, billions of dollars are pumped into subsidies that reinforce the status quo.
The only way to reform the system and make real progress toward mitigating climate change is to work to eliminate fossil fuels completely.
Vague goals based on nebulous technologies simply will not work.
Fighting Cybercrime with Neuro-Diversity
LONDON – Cybersecurity is one of the defining challenges of the digital age.
Everyone, from households to businesses to governments, has a stake in protecting our era’s most valuable commodity: data.
The question is how that can be achieved.
The scale of the challenge should not be underestimated.
With attackers becoming increasingly nimble and innovative, armed with an increasingly diverse array of weapons, cyber-attacks are happening at a faster pace and with greater sophistication than ever before.
The security team of my company, BT, a network operator and Internet service provider, detects 100,000 malware samples every day – that’s more than one per second.
Creative thinking among cyber attackers demands creative thinking among those of us fending them off.
Here, the first step is ensuring that there are enough talented and trained individuals engaged in the fight.
After all, according to a recent survey by the International Data Corporation, 97% of organizations have concerns about their security skills.
By 2022, another study estimates, there will be 1.8 million vacant cybersecurity jobs.
Amid this critical shortage of security specialists, it is imperative that we develop new approaches to attracting, educating, and retaining talented individuals, in order to create a deep pool of highly skilled cyber experts prepared to beat cybercriminals at their own game.
The key to success is diversity of talents and perspectives.
This includes neurological diversity, such as that represented by those with autism, Asperger syndrome, and attention-deficit disorder.
People with Asperger syndrome or autism, for example, tend to think more literally and systematically, making them particularly adept at mathematics and pattern recognition – critical skills for cybersecurity.
The problem is that neurologically exceptional people tend to be disadvantaged by the traditional interview process, which relies heavily on good verbal communication skills.
As a result, such people often struggle to find employment, and even when they do find a job, their work environment may not be able to support them adequately.
The United Kingdom’s National Autistic Society reports that just 16% of autistic adults in Britain have full-time paid employment, and only 32% have any kind of paid work, compared to 47% for disabled people and 80% for non-disabled people.
This highlights the scale of the challenge faced by such candidates, as well as the vast untapped resource that they represent.
Recognizing the potential of neurological diversity to contribute to strengthening cybersecurity, we at BT have reframed how we interact with candidates during interviews.
We encourage them to talk about their interests, rather than expecting them simply to answer typical questions about their employment goals or to list their strengths and weaknesses.
This approach has already been applied with great success by the likes of Microsoft, Amazon, and SAP in the areas of coding and software development, and by the UK’s GCHQ intelligence and security organization, one of the country’s biggest employers of autistic people.
Of course, an updated approach to interviewing candidates will not work for everyone.
But it is a start.
More broadly, we must do more not just to expand the opportunities available to neurologically exceptional candidates, but also to ensure that these opportunities are well publicized.
Delivering this change will require leadership by – and cooperation between – government and business.
I am pleased to say that, on this front, BT is already taking a leading role, including by working with the British government on their Cyber Discovery program, a special initiative to attract schoolchildren into the cyber industry, and through our own apprenticeship programs.
In the digital age, neuro-diversity should be viewed as a competitive advantage, not a hindrance.
We now have a chance to invest in talented people who are often left behind when it comes to work, benefiting them, business, and society as a whole.
By recognizing and developing the skills of this widely overlooked talent pool, we can address a critical skills shortage in our economies and enhance our ability to fight cybercrime.
Such opportunities are not to be missed.
A Strategy to Unite and Safeguard Europe
BRUSSELS – The purpose – and even the survival – of the European Union is being questioned as never before.
In fact, Europe’s citizens and the world need a strong EU now more than ever.
Europe’s wider region has become less stable and more insecure in recent years.
Moreover, the crises within and beyond the EU’s borders are directly affecting the lives of all European citizens.
In challenging times such as these, a strong EU is one that thinks strategically, shares a vision, and acts together.
In the wake of the United Kingdom’s vote to “Brexit” the EU, we Europeans will indeed have to rethink how our Union works; but we know very well what we need to work for.
We know what our principles, interests, and priorities are.
This is no time for political uncertainty.
The EU needs a strategy that marries a shared vision to common action.
None of the EU’s member states, acting alone, has the strength to address the threats that Europe faces.
Nor can they seize the opportunities presented by today’s global economy alone.
But as a Union of more than a half-billion citizens, Europe’s potential is unparalleled.
Our diplomatic network is broad and deep, covering every corner of the globe.
Economically, we are in the world’s G3, alongside China and the United States.
We are the top trading partner and foreign investor for almost every country in the world.
Together, the EU’s member states invest more in development cooperation than the rest of the world combined.
It is also clear, though, that we in Europe are not making full use of this potential, at least not yet.
A vast majority of our citizens understands that we need to take collective responsibility for our role in the world.
Our partners, too, expect the EU to play a major role, including as a global security provider.
The EU can deliver on its citizens’ needs and make its partnerships work only if we all act together – EU institutions and national governments, at all levels, united.
This is exactly the aim of the Global Strategy for European Foreign and Security Policy, which I recently presented to the leaders of the member states and to the European Commission and European Council.
This Strategy, the EU’s first in over a decade, focuses on defense capabilities and anti-terrorism as much as on job opportunities, social inclusion, and human rights.
It deals with peace building and the resilience of states and societies in and around Europe.
The EU has always prided itself on its soft power – and it will continue to do so, because we are the best in this field.
But the idea that Europe is an exclusively “civilian power” does not do justice to an evolving reality.
For example, the EU currently conducts 17 military and civilian operations around the world.
In places as far afield as Afghanistan and Congo, Georgia and the Sahel, Moldova, Somalia, and the Mediterranean, thousands of men and women serve under the European flag.
For today’s Europe, soft and hard power go hand in hand.
The Strategy nurtures the ambition of strategic autonomy for the EU, which is necessary to promote our citizens’ common interests, as well as our principles and values.
Yet we know that such priorities are best served when we are not alone, and in an international system based on multilateralism and rules, not on global policemen and lone warriors.
This is why the EU will continue to deepen the transatlantic bond and our partnership with NATO, while also connecting to new players and exploring new formats to advance our Strategy.
The EU will invest in regional institutions, and in cooperation within and among regions.
And we will promote global governance reforms that can meet this century’s challenges.
As we do this, we will engage in a practical and principled way, sharing global responsibilities with our partners and contributing to their strengths.
Two decades of spreading global uncertainties have taught us a clear lesson: my neighbor’s weaknesses and my partner’s weaknesses are my own weaknesses.
So we will move beyond the illusion that international politics can be a zero-sum game.
Acting with resolution in this way will make each of the EU’s member states – and each citizen of our Union – better off.
But all the goals outlined here can be achieved only by a truly united and committed Europe.
Joining all our cultures together to achieve our shared goals and serve our common interests is a daily challenge, but it is also our greatest strength: diversity is what makes us strong.
Our interests are indeed common European interests, and the only way to serve them is by common means.
That is why all Europeans, and all EU member states, have a collective responsibility to strengthen our Union.
The people of Europe need unity of purpose and action among our member states.
A fragile world calls for a more confident and responsible EU, equipped with an outward- and forward-looking foreign and security policy.
The new Global Strategy will guide us as we work toward a Union that truly meets its citizens’ needs, hopes, and aspirations; a Union that builds on the success of 70 years of peace; and a Union strong enough to contribute to peace and security in our region and worldwide.
A New Grand Coalition for Germany – and Europe
NEW YORK – Friends of Germany and Europe around the world have been breathing a sigh of relief at the newfound willingness of Germany’s Christian Democrats and Social Democrats (SPD) to discuss reprising their grand coalition government.
The world needs a strong and forward-looking Germany in a dynamic European Union.
A new grand coalition working alongside French President Emmanuel Macron’s government would make that possible.
The SPD’s initial decision to go into opposition after its poor election result in September may have been sincere, and even strategically sound.
But it is not timely.
Diplomacy almost everywhere is fractured.
The United States is reckoning with a psychologically unstable president, a plutocratic cabinet, and a Republican congressional majority.
Europe is in the throes of multiple economic, social, political, and institutional crises.
China, by contrast, is dynamic and outward-looking – providing good reason for the EU to assume vigorous leadership and engage in constructive partnerships with China on key initiatives (such as sustainable infrastructure across Eurasia).
In short, this is a critical time for Germany and Europe to provide vision, stability, and global leadership.
And that imperative extends to Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union (CDU), its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), and the SPD.
But the CDU/CSU and the SPD need to do more than merely extend the previous government, which was too parochial in outlook and temperament.
The world and Europe need an outward-looking Germany that offers more institutional and financial innovation, so that Europe can be a true counterpart to the US and China on global affairs.
I say this as someone who believes firmly in Europe’s commitment and pioneering statecraft when it comes to sustainable development, the core requirement of our time.
Economic growth that is socially inclusive and environmentally sustainable is a very European idea, one that has now been embraced globally in the United Nations’ 2030 Agenda and its 17 Sustainable Development Goals, as well as in the 2015 Paris climate agreement.
Europe’s experience with social democracy and Christian democracy made this global vision possible.
But now that its agenda has been adopted worldwide, Europe’s leadership in fulfilling it has become essential.
A grand coalition government in Germany must help put Europe in a position to lead.
French President Emmanuel Macron has offered some important ideas: a European finance minister; Eurobonds to finance a new European investment program; more emphasis on innovation; a financial transactions tax to fund increased aid to Africa, where Europe has a strategic interest in long-term development; and tax harmonization more generally, before the US triggers a global race to the bottom on taxing corporations and the rich.
Contrary to the Germans who oppose such ideas, a European finance minister and Eurobonds would not and should not lead to fiscal profligacy, but rather to a revival of investment-led green growth in Europe.
China has proposed the Belt and Road Initiative to build green infrastructure linking Southeast Asia and Central Asia with Europe.
This is the time for Europe to offer the same bold vision, creating a partnership with China to renovate Eurasia’s infrastructure for a low-carbon future.
If Europe plays its cards right, Europe’s (and China’s) scientific and technical excellence would flourish under such a vision.
If not, we will all be driving Chinese electric vehicles charged by Chinese photovoltaic cells in the future, while Germany’s automotive industry will become a historical footnote.
A European finance minister would, moreover, finally end Europe’s self-inflicted agony in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis.
As difficult as it is to believe, Greece’s crisis continues to this day, at Great Depression scale, ten years after the onset of the crisis.
This is because Europe has been unable, and Germany unwilling, to clean up the financial mess (including Greece’s unpayable debts) in a fair and forward-looking manner (akin to the 1953 London Agreement on German External Debts, as Germany’s friends have repeatedly reminded it).
If Germany won’t help to lead on this issue, Europe as a whole will face a prolonged crisis with severe social, economic, and political repercussions.
In three weeks, Macron will convene world leaders in Paris on the second anniversary of the climate accord.
France should certainly take a bow here, but so should Germany.
During Germany’s G20 Presidency, Merkel kept 19 of the 20members of the G20 firmly committed to the Paris agreement, despite US President Donald Trump’s disgraceful attempt to wreck it.
Yes, the corruption of US politics (especially campaign funding by the oil and gas industry) threatened the global consensus on climate change.
But Germany stood firm.
The new coalition should also ensure that the country’s Energiewende (“energy transition”) delivers on the 2020 targets set by previous governments.
These achievable and important commitments should not be a bargaining chip in coalition talks.
A CDU/CSU-SPD alliance, working with France and the rest of Europe, could and should do much more on climate change.
Most important, Europe needs a comprehensive energy plan to decarbonize fully by 2050.
This will require a zero-carbon smart power grid that extends across the continent and taps into the wind and solar power not only of southern Europe but also of North Africa and the eastern Mediterranean.
Once again, Eurobonds, a green partnership with China, and unity within Europe could make all the difference.
Such an alliance would also enable a new foreign policy for Europe, one that promotes peace and sustainable development, underpinned by new security arrangements that do not depend so heavily on the US.
Europe, a magnet for hundreds of millions of would-be economic migrants, could, should, and I believe would regain control of its borders, allowing it to strengthen and enforce necessary limits on migration.
The political terms of a new grand coalition government, it would seem, are clear.
The SPD should hold out for ministerial leadership on economic and financial policy, while the CDU/CSU holds the chancellorship.
That would be a true coalition, not one that could bury the SPD politically or deny it the means to push for a truly green, inclusive, EU-wide, sustainable development agenda.
With Merkel and SPD leader Martin Schulz in the lead, the German government would be in excellent, responsible, and experienced hands.
Germany’s friends and admirers, and all supporters of global sustainable development, are hoping for this breakthrough.
Controlling Cyber Conflict
LAS VEGAS – When cyber-security professionals were polled recently at their annual BlackHat conference in Las Vegas, 60% said they expected the United States to suffer a successful attack against its critical infrastructure in the next two years.
And US politics remains convulsed by the aftermath of Russian cyber interference in the 2016 election.
Are cyber-attacks the wave of the future, or can norms be developed to control international cyber conflict?
We can learn from the history of the nuclear age.
While cyber and nuclear technologies are vastly different, the process by which society learns to cope with a highly disruptive technology shows instructive similarities.
It took states about two decades to reach the first cooperative agreements in the nuclear era.
If one dates the cyber-security problem not from the beginning of the Internet in the 1970s, but from the late 1990s, when burgeoning participation made the Internet the substrate for economic and military interdependence (and thus increased our vulnerability), cooperation is now at about the two-decade mark.
The first efforts in the nuclear era were unsuccessful United Nations-centered treaties.
In 1946, the US proposed the Baruch plan for UN control of nuclear energy, and the Soviet Union promptly rejected locking itself into a position of technological inferiority.
It was not until after the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962 that a first arms control agreement, the Limited Test Ban Treaty, was signed, in 1963. The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty followed in 1968, and the bilateral US-USSR Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty in 1972.
In the cyber field, Russia proposed a UN treaty to ban electronic and information weapons (including propaganda) in 1999.
With China and other members of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, it has continued to push for a broad UN-based treaty.
The US resisted what it saw as an effort to limit American capabilities, and continues to regard a broad treaty as unverifiable and deceptive.
Instead, the US, Russia, and 13 other states agreed that the UN Secretary General should appoint a Group of Governmental Experts (GGE), which first met in 2004.
That group initially produced meager results; but, by July 2015, it issued a report, endorsed by the G20, that proposed norms for limiting conflict and confidence-building measures.
Groups of experts are not uncommon in the UN process, but only rarely does their work rise from the UN’s basement to a summit of the world’s 20 most powerful states.
But while the GGE’s success was extraordinary, last month it failed and was unable to issue a consensus report for 2017.
The GGE process has limitations.
The participants are technically advisers to the UN Secretary General rather than fully empowered national negotiators.
Over the years, as the number of GGE member states increased from the original 15 to 20 and then to 25, the group became more unwieldy, and political issues became more intrusive.
According to one diplomat who has been central to the process, some 70 countries have expressed interest in participating.
But as the numbers expand, the difficulty of reaching agreement increases.
There is a wide range of views about the future of the GGE process.
A first draft of a new report existed at the beginning of this year, and the able German chairman argued that the group should not rewrite the 2015 report, but try to say more about the steps that states should take in peacetime.
Some states suggested new norms to address data integrity and maintenance of the Internet’s core structures.
There was general agreement about confidence-building measures and the need to strengthen capacity.
The US and like-minded states pressed for further clarification of the earlier agreement that international laws of armed conflict, including the right of self-defense, apply in cyber space, but China, Russia, and their allies were reluctant to agree.
And the deterioration in US-Russian relations soured the political climate.
Moreover, whereas some states hope to revive the GGE process or enlarge it into a broader UN process, others are skeptical, and believe that future progress will be limited to discussions among like-minded states, rather than leading to universal agreements.
Norms that may be ripe for discussion outside the GGE process could include protected status for the core functions of the Internet; supply-chain standards and liability for the Internet of Things; treatment of election processes as protected infrastructure; and, more broadly, norms for issues such as crime and information warfare.
All of these are among the topics that may be considered by the new informal Global Commission on Stability in Cyberspace established early this year and chaired by former Estonian Foreign Minister Marina Kaljurand.
Progress on the next steps of norm formation will require simultaneous use of many different formats, both private and governmental.
For example, the 2015 agreement between China and the US to limit industrial cyber espionage was a bilateral accord that was later taken up by the G20.
In some cases, the development of norms among like-minded states can attract adherence by others at a later point.
In others, such as the Internet of Things, norms for security standards may benefit from leadership by the private sector or non-profit stakeholders in establishing codes of conduct.
And progress in some areas need not wait for others.
A regime of norms may be more robust when linkages are not too tight, and an over-arching UN treaty would harm such flexibility at this point.
Expansion of participation is important for the acceptance of norms, but progress will require action on many fronts.
Given this, the failure of the GGE in July 2017 should not be viewed as the end of the process.
Unconventional Monetary Policy on Stilts
NEW YORK – With most advanced economies experiencing anemic recoveries from the 2008 financial crisis, their central banks have been forced to move from conventional monetary policy – reducing policy rates via open-market purchases of short-term government bonds – to a range of unconventional policies.
Although the zero nominal bound on interest rates – previously only a theoretical possibility – had been reached and zero-interest-rate policy (ZIRP) had been implemented, growth remained anemic.
So central banks embraced measures that didn’t even exist in their policy toolkit a decade ago.
And now they are poised to do so again.
The list of unconventional measures has been extensive.
There was quantitative easing (QE), or purchases of long-term government bonds, once short-term rates were already zero.
This was accompanied by credit easing (CE), which took the form of central-bank purchases of private or semi-private assets – such as mortgage- and other asset-backed securities, covered bonds, corporate bonds, real-estate trust funds, and even equities via exchange-traded funds.
The aim was to reduce private credit spreads (the difference between yields on private assets and those on government bonds of similar maturity) and to boost, directly and indirectly, the price of other risky assets such as equities and real estate.
Then there was “forward guidance” (FG), the commitment to keep policy rates at zero for longer than economic fundamentals justified, thereby further reducing shorter-term interest rates.
For example, committing to maintain zero policy rates for, say, three years implies that interest rates on securities with up to a three-year maturity should also fall to zero, given that medium-term interest rates are based on expectations concerning short-term rates over the next three years.
Capping things off, there was unsterilized currency-market intervention to boost exports via a weaker currency.
These policies did indeed reduce long- and medium-term interest rates on government securities and mortgage bonds.
They also narrowed credit spreads on private assets, boosted the stock market, weakened the currency, and reduced real interest rates by increasing inflation expectations.
So they were partly effective.
Still, in most advanced economies, growth (and inflation) remained stubbornly low.
There was no shortage of reasons for this.
Given deleveraging from high private and public debts, unconventional monetary policies could prevent severe recessions and outright deflation; but they could not bring about robust growth and 2% inflation.
Moreover, the policy mix was suboptimal.
While monetary policy can play an important role in boosting growth and inflation, structural policies are needed to increase potential growth and keep firms, households, banks, and government from turning into zombies, chronically unable to spend because of too much debt.
And fiscal policies were also necessary to support aggregate demand.
Unfortunately, the political economy of most structural reforms – with their front-loaded costs and back-loaded benefits – implies that they occur only slowly.
At the same time, fiscal policy has been constrained in some countries by high deficits and debts (which jeopardize market access), and in others (the eurozone, the United Kingdom, and the United States, for example) by a political backlash against further fiscal stimulus, leading to austerity measures that undermine short-term growth.
So, like it or not, central banks became and still are the only game in town when it comes to supporting aggregate demand, lifting employment, and preventing deflation.
As a result, unconventional monetary policies – entrenched now for almost a decade – have themselves become conventional.
And, in view of persistent lackluster growth and deflation risk in most advanced economies, monetary policymakers will have to continue their lonely fight with a new set of “unconventional unconventional” monetary policies.
Some have already been implemented.
For example, negative interest policy rates (NIRPs) are now standard in Switzerland, Sweden, Denmark, the eurozone, and Japan, where the excess reserves that banks hold with central banks as a result of QE are taxed with a negative rate.
Policymakers have shifted from working on the quantity of money (QE, CE, and foreign-exchange intervention) to working on the price of money (first ZIRP, then FG, and now NIRP).
Nominal interest rates are now negative not only for overnight debt, but also for ten-year government bonds.
Indeed, about $6 trillion worth of government bonds around the world today have negative nominal yields.
The next stage of unconventional unconventional monetary policy – if the risks of recession, deflation and financial crisis sharply increase – could have three components.
First, central banks could tax cash to prevent banks from attempting to avoid the negative-rate tax on excess reserves.
With banks unable to switch into cash (thereby earning zero rates), central banks could go even more negative with policy rates.
Second, QE could evolve into a “helicopter drop” of money or direct monetary financing by central banks of larger fiscal deficits.
Indeed, the recent market buzz has been about the benefits of permanent monetization of public deficits and debt.
Moreover, while QE has benefited holders of financial assets by boosting the prices of stocks, bonds, and real estate, it has also fueled rising inequality.
A helicopter drop (through tax cuts or transfers financed by newly printed money) would put money directly into the hands of households, boosting consumption.
Third, credit easing by central banks, or purchases of private assets, could broaden significantly.
Think of direct purchases of stocks, high-risk corporate bonds, and banks’ bad loans.
If unconventional unconventional monetary policies sound a little crazy, it’s worth remembering that the same was said about “conventional unconventional” policies just a few years ago.
And if current conditions in the advanced economies remain entrenched a decade from now, helicopter drops, debt monetization, and taxation of cash may turn out to be the new QE, CE, FG, ZIRP, and NIRP.
Desperate times call for desperate measures.
Ending the Business of Child Labor
NEW DELHI – In October 1997, when global leaders gathered in Oslo to strategize how to end child labor, we brought a huge ambition and a deep commitment to change.
Through improved collaboration and planning, we sought to protect children from exploitation, and to develop “new strategies to eliminate child labor at the national, regional, and international levels.”
Now, 20 years later, it is time to ask: how have we done?
Poorly.
Since that first meeting, the world has not even halved the number of children in the workforce.
In the last five years, the international community has managed to reduce the number of employed children by just 16 million, the slowest pace of reduction in decades.
Of the 152 million children working today, some 73 million are doing jobs considered hazardous.
Even “safe” child labor affects victims’ physical and physiological wellbeing long into adulthood.
Worse, according to the most recent data from the International Labor Organization, the world has made the least progress in protecting two of the most at-risk populations: children between the ages of five and 11, and young girls.
The problem is not that we have failed to learn anything during our four global gatherings (the most recent one, held in Buenos Aires, wrapped up earlier this month).
The problem is that we have failed, and are failing, to take our own advice.
Even as we talk, disturbing global developments have added a sinister twist to child labor and trafficking.
This was supposed to be the century of empowerment for the most marginalized.
Instead, we are witnessing globalization of the most perverted kind, with children becoming victims many times over.
Because traffickers can easily prey amid chaos, children in conflict zones are particularly vulnerable.
Syria has commanded attention for years because of the horrific violence to which children there are subjected.
But the global rise of organized gangs means that children in Asia, Africa, Latin America, and Europe are also at risk.
Stemming this trend requires urgent and coordinated investment in education and safety wherever children are at risk – in conflict zones, refugee camps, and in areas affected by natural disasters.
I am often left wondering how we got to this point.
Over the last 37 years, colleagues and I have rescued more than 87,000 children from forced labor in India.
We have rescued girls who were so abused that they lost their ability to speak.
Recently, we rescued children from a garment factory in New Delhi, where, for more than three years, they had been forced to sit and work for 20 hours a day in a basement with no ventilation.
When they were brought to Mukti Ashram, our transit rehabilitation center, many were unable to walk or even look up at the sun.
We are proud of our accomplishments.
But humans’ depravity is a source of continued sorrow.
How can we end this suffering once and for all?
Global gatherings, like the one that just ended, certainly have a role to play.
But talk alone will not suffice.
Serious problems confronting humanity are tackled only when stakeholders become full participants.
Successes in public health are instructive. For example, there was a time when diseases like polio and smallpox ravaged millions.
Through the coordinated efforts of doctors, volunteers, global institutions, local governments, and civil society, these diseases were tamed. Similar collaboration is needed now to reduce child labor.
The first place to start is targeting industries where child labor is present, such as agriculture.
In addition to strong legal frameworks, robust accountability mechanisms must be established to guarantee that child labor is not used in supply chains.
I have found that with the right incentives, businesses and consumers can become partners in eradicating child labor.
One example of this collaboration emerged from the carpet industry in South Asia, where children were being mercilessly exploited.
To force change, we launched a movement to educate consumers in the West to compel carpet factory owners to behave responsibly.
This led to the creation of a label, GoodWeave, which certifies that no child has been put to work manufacturing the product.
Since the label was launched more than 20 years ago, child labor in the region’s carpet industry has plummeted, from roughly one million to about 200,000.
Programs like these are helpful, but the most important changes must come from international efforts led by the United Nations.
Ending the vicious circle of child labor, illiteracy, and poverty will require inter-governmental agencies to come together around each of the Sustainable Development Goals that directly affect children.
These include Goal 8, ending forced labor, modern slavery, trafficking, and child labor; Goal 4, ensuring education for all; Goal 3, providing universal access to healthcare; and Goal 16, stopping all forms of violence against children.
To succeed, UN Secretary-General António Guterres will need to channel more resources toward improving children’s lives.
His first course of action should be to call a meeting with the heads of UN agencies and international organizations, as well as world leaders, to create an agenda for concerted and coordinated efforts to protect young people everywhere.
At the end of the day, only political will can disrupt the grim calculus of child labor.
We cannot build a more peaceful, sustainable world without ensuring the freedom, safety, and education of every child.
A life of work robs children of all three.
As I ponder the way forward, I cannot forget a young girl I met in Brazil, whose small hands were horribly injured and bleeding from plucking oranges.
She asked me a simple question, to which I did not have an answer: “How can the world enjoy the juice from these oranges when children like me have to shed their blood to pluck them?”
That is a question we all must ask ourselves, too.
The Return of the Newspaper
BANGKOK – Social media are no longer the new kid on the block, but in 2016, platforms like Twitter and Facebook looked poised to nudge traditional newspapers into obsolescence.
Following President Donald Trump’s victory in the United States, it seemed that the mainstream media had not only lost the plot, but had also lost their relevance.
Trump led the multi-pronged attack on traditional news media, and newspapers in particular.
But many members of the press were also quick to declare that their own character limit had been reached.
Accused of being elitist and out of sync with readers, newspapers’ reactions ranged from self-flagellation to repentance for the election result.
Flummoxed by the clobbering from all sides, pundits who could not get the Trump election right prophesied that declining sales, falling readership, and flagging credibility heralded the demise of the newspaper, as we have known it.
But more than one year later, it is clear that Trump’s victory did not mean any such thing.
On the contrary, his ascendancy has made the newspaper business more relevant than ever.
The most remarkable media story of 2017 may have been how Trump inadvertently made newspapers great again.
Newspapers achieved this remarkable turnaround by doing what they do best: investigative journalism and breaking stories.
Since November 2016, and particularly since Trump’s inauguration in January last year, newspapers have led with stories ranging from conflicts of interest involving Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, to evidence that the president’s former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, met with former Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak.
These tales of political intrigue competed for attention with lurid allegations of sexual misconduct by Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein, US Senate candidate Roy Moore, and other powerful men.
And the pummeling of Trump with inconvenient facts has not been limited to Russia’s meddling in the election.
It is important to remember that newspapers’ investments in rapid-response investigative teams, long-form stories, and data-driven journalism are possible only because more people are paying for their news, especially through digital subscriptions.
Millennials in the West, dismayed by the surge in “fake news,” are helping reverse declining circulations in major markets.
Growth trends are even more pronounced in the Asia Pacific region, where readers in China and India are leading a return to traditional newspapers.
Of course, newspapers’ post-election rebound was not entirely their own doing; it was also facilitated by social media’s failure to consolidate its gains.
Blinkered by the illusion of having snatched whatever influence newspapers commanded, social media’s mavens bungled their attempts to dethrone the older medium.
Instead of breaking stories, they took to drafting manifestos, like Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg’s 5,700-word jeremiad about nothing in particular.
And, while there was a time when 140 characters may have been more appealing than 700-word opinion pieces, brevity is no longer enough.
(Nor, for that matter, is lengthy incoherence).
Having abducted the truth, social media were at a loss about what to do with it.
They did not innovate by, for example, following the lead of BuzzFeed, a once-notorious “clickbait” factory that soon expanded into serious reportage and long-form journalism.
After the US election, BuzzFeed shook up the media industry by publishing the Steele dossier, a collection of private intelligence on Trump gathered by a former British MI6 officer.
A few months later, it produced an 8,500-word expose on Milo Yiannopoulos, a former star commentator for Breitbart News.
The Columbia Journalism Review called the article “groundbreaking,” though recent squabbles with CNN indicate a certain reluctance to accept BuzzFeed as a legitimate news organization – and, potentially, even the emergence of a new media war.
Meanwhile, most major social media platforms continued to feature whatever presidential nonsense interested or amused their users, like analyzing “covfefe.”
This has led many to assume that Trump himself drives the social media agenda.
Perhaps he does.
But Trump’s ad nauseam tweets about failing newspapers and fake news have also spurred more reasonable consumers to embrace newspapers as a bastion of anti-Trumpism.
In other words, newspapers’ revival is a visceral, if partisan, response to social media in the Trump era.
Trump, the upstart, is leading the battle against the media Brahmins, buoyed by a fellow disruptor, social media.
But Trump’s campaign is a losing one.
Newspapers have gained allies even on Capitol Hill.
When Congress grills executives from Facebook, Twitter, and Google, glee is evident in news headlines.
To add insult to social media’s injury, it is newspaper articles that are being relentlessly quoted in congressional testimony.
For example, former FBI Director James Comey’s memo on his interactions with Trump, which led to the hiring of a special prosecutor to investigate the Trump campaign’s connections to Russia, was leaked to The New York Times.
As calls to rein in social media grow, it is the world’s newspapers – until very recently thought to be on the ropes – that have provided the reporting needed to convince policymakers to act.
Because social media companies, for all their power and potential, never developed the journalistic capacities needed to displace traditional news media, the pendulum has changed direction.
The Next Fed Chair
CAMBRIDGE – US President Donald Trump’s administration is expected, by November 2, to announce its choice, subject to Senate approval, to succeed Janet Yellen as Chair of the Federal Reserve Board in February 2018.
The White House has indicated that it is weighing five potential candidates.
Not all of them would be a good choice.
The first candidate is Yellen herself.
Though Yellen is a Democrat originally appointed by President Barack Obama, there is strong precedent for Trump to re-appoint her.
Her three predecessors – Ben Bernanke, Alan Greenspan, and Paul Volcker – were each re-appointed to second terms by a president of the opposite party from the one who first appointed them, reflecting the value of continuity and predictability in central banking.
Yellen, whom I have known since we worked together in 1977, has performed very well in her nearly four years as Fed Chair.
Though she hasn’t confronted a crisis, she did help to sustain the US economy’s steady recovery from the 2007-09 recession.
Yellen, like Bernanke before her, used the Fed’s tools with a combination of clear communication and policy flexibility, shifting course as data revealed subtle changes in economic conditions.
The results speak for themselves.
When Yellen was appointed to the Fed Board as Vice Chair in 2010, the US unemployment rate was at 9.9%.
By the time she was promoted to Chair in 2014, it had fallen to 6.7%.
Today, it stands at just 4.2% – and yet inflation remains low.
Some complain that inflation remains below the 2% target; but the combination of low unemployment and low inflation used to be viewed as macroeconomic Nirvana.
The second potential candidate for Fed Chair is Jerome Powell, who has been on the Fed Board for five years.
Powell might represent a good compromise for policymakers.
On one hand, he has supported Yellen’s strategy, from her dovish interest-rate policies to her recent moves toward normalization.
On the other, he is a longtime Republican with a financial background.
But Powell might face skepticism for his lack of academic training as an economist.
PhD economists, like those who dominate the Fed’s staff and leadership, tend to favor their own kind and doubt others’ qualifications for top monetary-policy jobs.
Certainly, a central banker without an economics PhD could struggle to hold his or her own against a large staff fluent in the models and jargon of academic economics.
Given this, many view a doctorate as a prerequisite for any Fed chair.
But, in Powell’s case, I would argue that it should not be.
Having known him since 1990, I can say that Powell has never been shy about asking questions.
As a result, he has developed the analytical capabilities that a Fed governor needs.
Almost as important, he won’t have a chip on his shoulder when dealing with more credentialed staff.
From my perspective, Powell would stand out as one of the best appointments Trump has made.
The third potential candidate, Kevin Warsh, is a former Fed governor, who also has a background in finance – in this case, at Morgan Stanley – rather than in academic economics.
But that is where the similarity between him and Powell ends.
Warsh, like many Republicans, has harshly criticized the Fed’s attempts to stimulate the US economy in the aftermath of the global financial crisis, warning that the unprecedented expansion of the monetary base brought about by quantitative easing would trigger high inflation.
Warsh started making such hawkish – and clearly incorrect – warnings in 2010, when unemployment was 9.5% and runaway inflation was the last thing most economists were worried about.
One can’t help but wonder if Warsh understands how the economy works.
The same cannot credibly be asked about the fourth candidate, John Taylor.
Like Yellen, Taylor is an eminent economist with an impressive record both in academic research and as a practitioner of macroeconomic policy.
In fact, he is the sixth most widely cited monetary economist, owing his renown especially to the Taylor rule, a guideline for setting interest rates in response to observed inflation and growth.
Nonetheless, like Warsh, Taylor has long believed that monetary conditions are excessively generous.
That criticism was probably warranted during the housing boom that resulted in the 2007-09 financial crisis.
And Taylor was in an ideal position to deliver that message, because he served as Under Secretary of the Treasury for International Affairs until 2005, which means that he met regularly with Greenspan, then the Fed’s chair, in private.
One wonders why, if he is so opposed to easy monetary policy, he didn’t convey that to Fed governors at a time when the message might have done some good.
The White House’s final potential pick, Gary Cohn, is currently the director of Trump’s National Economic Council.
But Cohn, who has no background whatsoever in monetary economics and whose views are unknown, may already be out of the running.
The complaint of most Republican leaders since Obama took office in 2009 is that monetary policy has been too loose.
(Trump said the same when he was campaigning for the presidency, though, once in office, he suddenly proclaimed himself a “low rates guy.”)
House Republicans wanted the Fed to adopt Taylor-style rules then; now, they want Trump to appoint Taylor himself.
But, historically, Republicans have pushed easy monetary policy when they have had the presidency.
If, as is likely, financial markets and the economy run into headwinds in the medium term – perhaps in the run-up to the next presidential election – Trump will almost certainly blame his troubles on the Fed.
The complaint, however, will not be that monetary policy is too easy, but that it is too tight.
Good central bankers wouldn’t heed such politicized criticism either way.
They would make decisions based on what they believe is best for the economy, relying on evolving data, not on evolving political imperatives.
The sitting governors have demonstrated the ability to do that.
Polio’s Last Stand
GENEVA – It has been a tough year for Nigeria.
In the last 12 months, the country has suffered attacks by child suicide bombers and brutal massacres by Boko Haram.
The vast majority of the 276 schoolgirls abducted in Chibok last year are still missing.
And yet, during this time, despite such horrors, Nigeria has quietly managed to achieve something truly remarkable: an entire year without a single new case of wild polio.
This is a great achievement for Nigeria and all of its partners in the effort to eradicate the disease.
Less than 30 years ago, polio plagued 125 countries, paralyzing 1,000 children a day.
Until now, there were only three countries where the virus was still considered endemic: Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Nigeria.
Health officials wait three years before declaring a country polio-free, but the one-year milestone in Nigeria raises hopes that we may have already seen the last case of wild polio in the country – and the whole of Africa.
In addition to the logistical challenge of reaching every child in Africa’s most populated country, the Nigerian polio-eradication campaign has had to overcome security issues, opposition by religious fundamentalists, and rampant corruption.
The fact that a country as troubled as Nigeria could pull off such an important feat is cause for celebration and provides grounds for optimism, not only in the fight against polio, but for global health efforts in general.
Nigeria’s success shows that it is possible to bring the miracles of modern medicine to the world’s most marginalized and hard-to-reach children.
This has huge implications for the reduction of childhood mortality.
The children that had previously not been reached with polio vaccines live in communities with little or no access to routine immunization, maternal healthcare, nutritional supplements, deworming, or malaria prevention.
They are the children who are most at risk of dying before they reach their fifth birthday.
Nigeria’s success in reaching these children is the result of the efforts of thousands of dedicated local volunteers, some of whom lost their lives in the process.
Since 2012, there has been nearly a fivefold increase in the number of volunteers involved in mobilizing communities during immunization campaigns.
Meanwhile, government, global health organizations like the World Health Organization and UNICEF, civil-society organizations, and community leaders, all working together, managed to identify and bridge the gaps that have historically impaired access to polio vaccines.
In early 2012, for example, Nigeria’s government established dedicated emergency operations centers to coordinate data flow, facilitate decision-making, and improve accountability within the program.
With support from Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, Nigeria also installed more than 1,600 solar-powered refrigerators, which are critical to ensuring that vaccines remain safe and effective during their long journey through the distribution chain.
These investments in physical and social infrastructure provide a means of protecting children from a range of diseases.
Already, polio workers in Nigeria are spending more than half their time providing unrelated but vital health services.
The infrastructure has helped introduce new vaccines – such as pneumococcal conjugate vaccines, which protect against pneumonia, the biggest killer of children under the age of five – and increased coverage of routine immunization against measles and rubella.
Thanks to the emergency operations centers, this infrastructure even helped to stop the Ebola outbreak in Nigeria in 2014, by enabling contact tracing and surveillance.
These efforts have the additional benefit of ensuring that Nigeria cements its polio-free status.
The health infrastructure put in place during the eradication campaign has enabled the deployment of injectable polio vaccines, which will complement the oral vaccines in ensuring that the virus does not return.
This was also the pattern in India, the most recent country to be declared officially free of polio, with no cases since 2010.
The infrastructure put in place to deliver polio vaccines there is now being used to increase coverage of routine immunization, like the 5-in-1 pentavalent vaccine.
India can now wind down its polio-eradication campaigns, but still maintain its polio-free status.
So far, in 2015, only 34 cases of polio have been documented worldwide – the majority of them in Pakistan.
There is now a very real prospect that we could see the last ever case of wild polio – a disease that once threatened millions of people – before the end of 2016.
To eradicate the disease, however, we will have to build on successes like Nigeria’s and strengthen routine immunization efforts.
The end of polio should mark not just the defeat of a terrible disease, but also the beginning of a new phase in the effort to reduce childhood suffering and death, the benefits of which will be felt for generations to come.
A New Trump?
WASHINGTON, DC – It’s generally agreed in Washington, DC, that President Donald Trump’s presidency is entering a new phase.
Defining just what that phase is, is proving to be problematic.
The widespread expectation was that the removal of Stephen Bannon – the former White House chief adviser and resident avatar of white American nationalism – would make the administration run more smoothly, mitigate (though not eliminate) infighting, and reduce the number of leaks.
The internal warfare may be quieter since John Kelly took over as White House Chief of Staff and imposed more order in the West Wing.
But so long as Trump is president, orderliness will not be the White House’s chief characteristic.
In fact, Trump remains in frequent contact with Bannon, who is back in charge at Breitbart News.
Inevitably, by early September, after Kelly had been on the job for all of five weeks, Trump was chafing under his new chief of staff’s restrictions.
Kelly has imposed tight controls over who may enter the Oval Office, listens in on most of Trump’s phone calls during office hours, and controls what pieces of paper reach the president’s desk, thus eliminating the highly ideological screeds that some staff members used to slip him.
The problem is that Trump likes disorder; that’s how he had run his business, and he doesn’t take well to being managed.
He liked having favored people wandering into his office as they chose, and it’s been his managerial creed to play people off each other.
Nor does he bother to control his temper when dealing with aides.
Even Kelly, an ex-Marine Corps general, has come under the lash of Trump’s tongue.
Observers now take bets on when Kelly will decide he’s had enough.
I’ve never known a White House where so much depends on who has incurred the president’s ire.
Gary Cohn, the former Goldman Sachs president and chief operating officer who serves as Trump’s chief economic adviser, is the latest to be frozen out.
Cohn’s sin was to let it be known publicly that he almost resigned following the violence last month in Charlottesville, Va., when Trump equated white supremacist and neo-Nazi demonstrators, many of them armed, with those who opposed them.
Actually, one can have some sympathy for a president with an aide who wants to have it both ways, as Cohn did – letting his apparent anguish be known without acting on it.
But there can be problems when a president chooses to disregard his chief economic adviser.
Cohn has been seen as one of the administration’s more moderate voices, and he has wanted to succeed Janet Yellen as chair of the US Federal Reserve.
Speculation about the possibility of a “new Trump” peaked in early September, when the president suddenly cut a deal with Democratic congressional leaders.
Trump agreed with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, and her Senate counterpart, Chuck Schumer, on how to increase the federal debt limit, which Congress must raise each year as spending increases, and extend appropriations to keep the government running (because Congress routinely fails to write appropriations bills on time).
Both items were tied to a special appropriation in the wake of Hurricane Harvey to pay for recovery efforts.
(The larger Hurricane Irma hadn’t yet hit.)
In the midst of the discussion at the Oval Office meeting with Pelosi and Schumer, Trump interrupted Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin as he was defending the Republicans’ position that these issues should be put off for 18 months, until after the 2018 congressional elections.
The Democrats had argued that the increase in the debt ceiling and extension of appropriations should last for only three months, thus forcing the Republicans to take electorally risky votes before the 2018 elections.
Before the meeting, House Speaker Paul Ryan had adamantly rejected the Democrats’ proposal.
But suddenly, without notifying even his own aides, Trump went for it.
The author of The Art of the Deal had accepted the Democrats’ opening position.
Commentators went into overdrive, imbuing the episode with broad significance: Trump was now not a Republican but an Independent.
He might start a third party.
His move marked the beginning of a new way of governing.
In fact, Trump merely saw an opportunity and took it.
With no real legislative achievements to claim, he did something.
The Republican congressional leaders, Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, had been in bad odor with Trump for a while, because they had been unable to deliver on his legislative agenda.
He was embarrassed and angered at their failure to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare.
(Trump didn’t recognize his own contributions to the debacle.)
On many issues, Trump lacks a governing majority in the Senate.
Overlooked in all the excitement over Trump’s lining up with Democratic leaders was that the issue at hand concerned legislative timing, not substance.
And the subsequent fevered discussions about Trump’s core beliefs – maybe he was a crypto-Democrat, who had, after all, donated to Democratic candidates at one time and sympathized with Democratic positions (such as on abortion) – missed the point.
Trump harbors no particular political philosophy; he’s an opportunist who craves publicity and praise.
But his maverick behavior might turn out to be self-perpetuating.
For all his contempt for the “dishonest media,” Trump was ecstatic about the positive press coverage his bipartisan move received.
And that might lure him to try for more.
Making Economic Sanctions on North Korea Work
CAMBRIDGE – Last week, in a brazen rebuff to tough new United Nations sanctions, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un’s regime fired a ballistic missile over the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido – its second launch over Japan in less than three weeks.
But, far from indicating that sanctions don’t work, Kim’s move shows that they still aren’t tough enough.
The latest sanctions cap oil imports, ban textile exports, and penalize designated North Korean government entities.
Following Kim’s response, sanctions should be tightened even further, to stop all trade with North Korea, including halting all fuel imports.
North Korea is one of the most insular countries in the world.
That insularity is a curse for the long-suffering North Korean people, but an advantage for a sanction-based strategy, because only one country is needed to make it work: China.
From an economic perspective, China is the only country that really matters to North Korea, as it controls about 90% of the North’s foreign trade and supplies almost all of its fuel.
Yet China’s economy would barely register the effect of new sanctions: North Korea’s annual GDP, at a meager $28 billion, constitutes little more than a rounding error for its giant neighbor.
The lack of viable commercial alternatives and the massive asymmetry of power between North Korea and those imposing sanctions mean that a stricter sanctions regime would push the country into a corner.
The question is whether economic hardship would induce North Korea to change its nuclear policy. Though it is impossible to say for sure, a look at the economics of North Korea’s nuclear program suggests that it might.
Contrary to popular perception, nuclear arms are weapons of the poor – extraordinarily cheap compared with conventional armaments.
In fact, it was this rationale that drove the Soviet Union’s massive nuclear buildup: Soviet leaders, recognizing that they could not compete with the much wealthier United States’ conventional weapons, focused their country’s limited resources on creating a potentially devastating nuclear arsenal.
Likewise, North Korea’s focus on nuclear, rather than conventional, weapons may be enabling it to minimize the tradeoff between guns and butter.
Indeed, there are reports of some vitality in the North Korean economy, with markets full of goods and new buildings under construction.
Tighter sanctions are therefore needed to increase the economic price that the regime must pay for its nuclear program.
Even if North Korea does not change its policy, total economic isolation may bring about an end to its nuclear program, by sowing internal discord and, ultimately, triggering the regime’s collapse.
Yet China hopes to avoid precisely this outcome – which is a key reason why it has so far refused to escalate sanctions further.
China worries that the collapse of the Kim regime would fuel a major refugee crisis, with millions of Koreans pouring across its border in search of food, shelter, and security – and imposing heavy economic and social costs on China in the process.
Moreover, Chinese leaders fear the loss of the North Korean buffer separating China from US troops stationed in South Korea.
Given the widespread belief in Chinese policy circles that the US secretly hopes to re-fight the Korean war and establish a single US-allied Korea on China’s border, the potency of this concern should not be underestimated.
US President Donald Trump’s administration understands the central importance of China to any strategy to rein in North Korea’s nuclear ambitions.
But, so far, the US has relied on threats, such as halting $650 billion in bilateral trade, to persuade China to cooperate.
This is not a stick, but a boomerang – one that will hit China and immediately return to smack the US.
What is needed instead are carrots.
Persuading China to isolate the North economically will require the international community to establish some agreement regarding how regime collapse would be handled, with an eye to allaying China’s key concerns.
For starters, the entire international community, but especially the US, must explicitly pledge not to attempt to change the nature of the North Korean regime.
That means that if the Kim regime collapses, the US will not pursue reunification.
Instead, China should exercise primary political custodianship of North Korea in the event that a political vacuum emerges.
Come what may, US and South Korean troops would not cross the 38th parallel.
Persuading China to impose potentially regime-destroying sanctions will also require economic pledges, with the entire international community – especially the US, Japan, and South Korea – committing to share the mammoth costs of sheltering refugees and rebuilding North Korea’s economy.
While China would inevitably cover a substantial share of these costs, owing to its geographic proximity and historic ties to the North, it needs reassurance that it would not be left to shoulder the burden alone.
Admittedly, this approach is somewhat reminiscent of the one taken at the 1945 Yalta Conference, where leaders of the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the US carved out geopolitical spheres of influence in post-World War II Europe.
Moral and ideological objections, therefore, are to be expected.
But it’s time to get real.
The nuclear threat posed by North Korea is serious, immediate, and requires a bold response.
This is not the time to be constrained by conventions and ideology; it is the time to do whatever is needed to defuse nuclear tensions and protect the lives of those in the Kim regime’s crosshairs.
China is the only country with the power to force North Korea to change its nuclear policy. Convincing the Chinese to wield that power must be world leaders’ top priority.
North Korea and US Leadership
DENVER – Earlier this month, North Korea went a couple of weeks without launching any missiles or testing nuclear weapons.
That short interval, which has since ended, was enough to inspire US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to declare that North Korean leader Kim Jong-un was showing “restraint.”
Perhaps, Tillerson concluded, Kim is ready to engage in dialogue.
To some extent, he may be right.
To be sure, claims that the North was showing restraint were clearly premature: North Korea has since fired three short-range ballistic missiles from its east coast into the sea, and, more ominously, launched a ballistic missile over northern Japan.
Tillerson’s optimism about such a short pause reflects the pressure diplomats face in reassuring allies – and, in Tillerson’s case, his boss, President Donald Trump – and easing tensions with enemies.
Nonetheless, Tillerson is probably right that North Korea is ready to talk to the United States – but only as one nuclear-weapons state to another.
What the country’s leaders are patently not ready for is to meet America’s own requirement: that negotiations are based on the international commitments made in 2005, at the end of the fourth round of the so-called six-party talks.
Chief among those commitments, enshrined in a joint statement released at the end of the talks, is North Korea’s abandonment of “all nuclear weapons and existing nuclear programs.”
In exchange, the other five participants in the talks (China, Japan, Russia, South Korea, and the US) were supposed to provide North Korea with energy and economic assistance, respect its sovereignty, and pursue the normalization of diplomatic relations.
The five participants stood by their commitments, but North Korea repudiated its own in 2009.
According to critics, creating the “precondition” that the North stick to its original commitments amounts to a death blow to new talks.
And, indeed, the Kim regime has shown no interest in resuming the six-party process, the stated purpose of which is to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula. In its 2013 constitution, North Korea for the first time even referred to itself as a “nuclear state.”
Tillerson rightly refers to a two-track policy toward North Korea.
One track is dialogue; the other is pressure, applied through sanctions and other measures aimed at isolating North Korea and convincing its leadership that it has no future with nuclear weapons.
After North Korea’s tests of its new intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) last month, Tillerson and the US ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, focused on the second track, working with other Security Council members to impose the toughest sanctions ever against the North.
Those sanctions could erode much of North Korea’s trade with China, the Kim regime’s economic lifeline.
But the US cannot rely excessively on other countries to constrain the North Korean regime, whose pursuit of nuclear weapons is not a symbolic quest.
As its ICBM tests show, the goal is to threaten the US explicitly, in order to compel it to reduce its presence in Northeast Asia – and perhaps even reconsider its alliances with Japan and South Korea.
This ambitious goal is not without tacit support in the world: Russia and China have proposed that the US suspend its annual military exercises with the South, in exchange for a freeze of North Korea’s nuclear program.
This supposedly fair-minded “freeze-for-freeze” proposal would do more to weaken the US-South Korea alliance than it would to impede North Korea’s development of a deliverable nuclear weapon.
The proposal highlights how difficult it is to mount an international response to the North Korea nuclear issue.
Though China agreed to the recent sanctions in the Security Council, there is widespread skepticism about whether there is an internal consensus about the future it wants for the Korean Peninsula.
Russia, for its part, seems to be pursuing a foreign policy guided more by spite than national interest.
America’s allies in the region, meanwhile, are under serious pressure.
South Korea’s new government is stuck between the need to manage its relations with the US and the desire to open a dialogue with the North.
And, as the North’s latest missile launch shows, Japan’s hosting of US military assets puts it on the front lines of the crisis.
This complex situation would require careful and precise diplomacy in the best of times, with the US using the various levers of its power.
But this is not the best of times.
Trump has been mercurial, given to making unscripted pronouncements on the topic.
This has called for assurances from Tillerson, Secretary of Defense James Mattis, and others eager to mitigate the impact of bellicose exclamations – incongruously issued off the cuff from the clubhouse of a golf course – about “fire and fury.”
Trump’s statements about China’s role in addressing the problem don’t help, as they imply an interest in effectively outsourcing the job of reining in the Kim regime, in exchange for vague economic and trade assurances.
The result is a perception of American unseriousness about this most serious of challenges.
The Trump administration has assembled before it all the components of an effective North Korea strategy: cooperation with China; pressure on North Korea through sanctions and isolation; reassurance of allies, including by providing the most up-to-date anti-ballistic missile defenses; and a willingness to talk.
But for any of these instruments to have an impact, they must be used in concert and with precision in tone and substance – a quality of statecraft that the Trump administration has been slow to master.
In this sense, the challenge in North Korea is not just a nuclear crisis. It is a crisis of the quality of US leadership.
Many see the problem, but no one knows yet how to overcome it.
Planning for Korean Reunification
SEOUL – The long-simmering North Korean nuclear crisis has reached a near boiling point.
Last month, the Hermit Kingdom launched two intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of hitting major US cities.
The United Nations Security Council responded with a unanimous vote to impose new economic sanctions on the country – the most stringent yet – which would cut at least one third of its annual export revenue.
Since then, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and US President Donald Trump have been hurling escalating threats at each other.
At this point, it is impossible to say what will happen on the Korean Peninsula.
For now, all the international community can really do is continue to leverage a combination of economic sanctions, military pressures, and diplomacy to try to get the Kim regime to the negotiating table.
But, at the same time, we should consider and prepare for all eventualities, from a military conflict to the peaceful reunification of North and South Korea.
The most catastrophic scenario would undoubtedly be a military conflict.
And yet the likelihood of that outcome has now actually increased, owing to the Trump administration’s recent announcement that it is reviewing its military options, including “preventive war.”
The truth is that a preemptive strike is far from a practical solution.
It is not at all clear that such an approach would lead to North Korean denuclearization or topple the Kim regime.
What it could do is escalate into an armed confrontation between the US and China, with nuclear war being the worst possible outcome.
South Koreans, well within the range of the North’s weapons, would suffer dearly from the Kim regime’s retaliation against a US strike.
To put it into perspective, the Korean War of 1950-1953 killed more than two million Koreans, as well as 36,000 Americans and 600,000 Chinese soldiers – and it didn’t even involve nuclear weapons.
A safer and more practical approach would focus on tightening the economic and political screws on North Korea.
To be sure, some argue that economic sanctions, however harsh, would be inadequate to compel North Korea’s leaders to give up their nuclear weapons.
After all, both Iraq’s Saddam Hussein and Libya’s Colonel Muammar Qaddafi halted their programs to acquire weapons of mass destruction, only to be driven out of power and then executed.
Given the risk implied by a military solution, more robust economic and political pressure remains the international community’s best bet for defusing the North Korean nuclear threat, whether by compelling the Kim regime to abandon its program or by triggering that regime’s collapse.
The UN Security Council sanctions are a step in the right direction, but they are not enough, as they do not ban supplies of oil to the North, apparently due to Chinese and Russian opposition.
In fact, though China agreed to the sanctions, it remains reluctant to aggravate its already tense relationship with its North Korean client.
This must change.
Stronger and more focused US-China cooperation is essential if sanctions are to have a chance of working.
Avoiding such cooperation will only make a devastating outcome – be it a military conflict or an unruly collapse of the Kim regime – more likely.
China could still be persuaded to take a more active role in constraining the Kim regime.
Indeed, its uncooperativeness could damage its relationships with the US, Europe, Japan, and South Korea – all of which are ultimately more valuable partners than the unruly, impoverished North Korea.
But for China to do more, it needs assurances that it will not immediately lose its strategic buffer on the Korean Peninsula.
Hence the need for an agreement now on how to handle the potential collapse of the Kim regime and the reunification of the Korean Peninsula.
Like the fall of the Berlin Wall, the Kim regime’s collapse could come about quite suddenly.
So China needs to know now that a reunified Korea would not be its enemy, and that the US would withdraw its troops that are currently stationed in South Korea.
Of course, the implications of a collapsed regime in North Korea extend far beyond China’s strategic interests.
Indeed, it would have a major economic and political impact throughout the region.
That is all the more reason to put a comprehensive plan in place to ensure a peaceful transition.
I recently conducted a quantitative assessment of the economic impacts of unification on North and South Korea under several hypothetical scenarios, assuming North Korea’s sudden collapse.
As it turns out, a peacefully managed unification process, characterized by comprehensive economic reform and opening up, could enable North Korea to achieve sustained double-digit GDP growth, despite a sharp slowdown immediately following the collapse.
The key to success would be to allow North Korea to take advantage of its relatively abundant human and natural resources, including rich mineral reserves, to achieve export-led industrialization.
As for South Korea, with sufficient preparation, effective policies, and more financial resources, it can manage a peaceful reunification and mitigate the adverse effects of the shock.
By contrast, in a scenario where South Korea is unprepared for reunification and the North quickly dissolves in a state of disorder, the risk premium on the Korean Peninsula would jump sharply, and reforms would be delayed.
This would lead to persistently weakened investment and GDP growth across the Korean Peninsula, causing South Korea’s GDP to decline by more than 3% in the initial years of the crisis.
Inflows of migrants from the North would compound the risks, potentially disrupting South Korean labor markets and causing social unrest.
For now, the international community, including China, should continue to push for North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons and pursue economic reforms, using ever-stronger economic sanctions.
Meanwhile, South Korea must continue its efforts to resume a dialogue with the North on humanitarian, health, and environmental issues.
Civilian exchanges and information flows could nurture forces that would bring about fundamental change from the inside.
Even after 70 years of division, South Koreans must not give up hope for peaceful reunification with our northern brethren. On the contrary, we must plan for it.
The North Korean Cult
NEW YORK – The absurdity of the North Korean dictatorship is easy to caricature.
Kim Jong-un, with his 1930s-style pudding-bowl haircut (cultivated, it is claimed, to make him resemble his grandfather, Kim Il-sung, the regime’s founder), his antiquated Mao suit, and his short, plump body, is almost like a cartoon character himself.
Officially regarded as an omnipotent genius, he is worshipped like a god and shown constantly surrounded by people, including his highest military officers festooned in medals, laughing or clapping, or shouting hysterically.
As we know, of course, life in North Korea is anything but amusing.
Periodic famines devastate the population.
Up to 200,000 political prisoners are kept as slaves in brutal labor camps, where they are lucky if they are not tortured to death.
And free speech does not exist.
It is not only forbidden to express reservations about Kim’s divine status; staying alive requires regularly proclaiming one’s devotion.
It is possible, even likely, that many North Koreans behave like worshippers only because they must.
Others fall into line because they don’t know any better.
Like people everywhere, they reflexively conform to the norms of the world around them, without thinking through their merits.
But some North Koreans, perhaps many, might genuinely believe in the cult of the Kim Dynasty, which, like all cults (or indeed religious faiths), is made up of bits and pieces taken from other cultures, beliefs, and traditions.
The Kim cult owes something to Stalinism, something to messianic Christianity, something to Confucian ancestor worship, something to indigenous shamanism, and something to the emperor worship of the Japanese, who ruled Korea in the first half of the twentieth century.
Kim’s father, Kim Jong-il, was supposed to have been born on Mount Paektu, believed to be a sacred spot where the divine founder of the first Korean kingdom, a bear-man named Tangun, was born more than 4,000 years ago.
The birth of Kim Jong-il, also known as the Dear Leader (his father, Kim Il-sung, was the Great Leader), turned winter into spring and was illuminated by a bright star in heaven.
All of this might sound zany, but the stories of miracles in any faith invariably do.
What matters is that people believe them.
In this respect, North Koreans are no weirder than believers anywhere else.
There are often good reasons why certain beliefs have a strong appeal.
Islam and Christianity found ready converts among outcasts and the oppressed because they offered equality in the eyes of God.
The North Korean faith is altogether less inclusive.
Indeed, at its core is a sense of ethnic purity, a feeling of sacred nationalism that must be defended at any cost against hostile forces.
Like Poland, which has a strong Christian self-image of national martyrdom, Korea has a history of being dominated by greater powers, mainly China, but also Russia, and, most notably since the brutal invasions of the sixteenth century, Japan.
The Americans are latecomers, but official hatred of American imperialism in North Korea stems not only from the savage Korean War, but also from the long memory of foreign oppression.
Domination by outside powers created poles of collaboration and resistance in Korean history.
Some of the ruling classes in various Korean kingdoms cooperated with the foreign powers, and some struggled against them.
This resulted in deep hatreds among Koreans themselves.
Kim Il-sung began his career as a collaborator.
He was handpicked by Stalin to be a puppet Communist leader in the North.
This made the legend of Kim as a resistance hero against the Japanese during World War II, and later against the Americans and their South Korean “collaborators,” all the more important.
North Korean nationalism, with its cult of self-reliance known as Juche, is as religious as it is political.
Defending the Kim dynasty, built up as a symbol of Korean resistance to foreign powers, is a sacred task.
And when the sacred takes over politics, compromise becomes almost impossible.
People can negotiate over conflicting interests, but not over matters that are considered holy.
Donald Trump, a real estate developer, believes that everything is negotiable.
Nothing is sacred in business.
His idea of making a deal is to overwhelm the other party with bluff and intimidation, hence his promise to “totally destroy North Korea” (a promise, by the way, that would mean more than 20 million dead).
It is hard to imagine how Kim Jong-un, as the divine defender of his people, could be persuaded by such bluster to negotiate.
It is possible that Kim, and perhaps even some subjects of his despotic rule, would rather be obliterated than give in.
It would not be the first time that a cult turned suicidal.
But there is another, more likely, risk.
Because Trump’s hostile tweets and swaggering public utterances are usually followed by more cautious statements from senior members of his cabinet, Kim might not take them seriously.
He may well think that Trump is all bluff and will never carry out his threats.
This might prod Kim into taking some reckless action – aiming a missile at Guam, for example – to which the US would feel it must respond in kind.
The result would be a catastrophe, not only for the Koreans who believe in Kim’s sacred mission, but above all for millions of Koreans, just 35 miles from the North Korean border, who have no part in the Kim cult at all.
North Korea’s Real Strategy
DENVER – North Korea’s quest for nuclear weapons is often depicted as a “rational” response to its strategic imperatives of national security and regime survival.
After all, the country is surrounded by larger, supposedly hostile states, and it has no allies on which it can rely to come to its defense.
It is only logical, on this view, that Kim Jong-un wants to avoid the mistake made by Iraq’s Saddam Hussein and Libya’s Muammar el-Qaddafi, both of whom would still be alive and in power had they acquired deliverable nuclear weapons.
In fact, North Korea’s appetite for nuclear weapons is rooted more in aggression than pragmatism.
North Korea seeks nothing less than to decouple the United States from its South Korean partner – a split that would enable the reunification of the Korean Peninsula on Kim’s terms.
In other words, North Korea does not want only to defend itself; it wants to set the stage for an invasion of its own.
Of course, such a scenario is, in many ways, the stuff of fancy.
But to be a North Korean today is not necessarily to accept the world as it is.
And North Korean propaganda continues to reiterate the view that the Korean Peninsula consists of one people, sharing one language and one culture, indivisible – except by outsiders like the US.
By this logic, the North needs to find a way to discourage those outsiders from intervening in the peninsula’s affairs.
As it stands, the US-South Korea relationship operates on the basis of something like the North Atlantic Treaty’s collective-defense clause, Article 5: any North Korean aggression against South Korea will, it is assured, be met by the combined forces of South Korea and the US.
Such a counterattack would be decisive, ensuring the total destruction of the North Korean regime.
If North Korea had long-range nuclear weapons, however, it might be able to change the strategic calculus, by threatening to launch a nuclear attack on the US mainland in response to US intervention on the Korean Peninsula.
The US might intervene anyway, launching its own devastating attack on North Korea.
But it might also choose not to risk casualties on its own soil.
If the US did shirk its collective-defense responsibilities, South Korea would still have plenty of recourse against its northern neighbor.
After all, South Korea’s conventional forces are far better trained, equipped, and motivated than their North Korean counterparts.
But it is hard to say whether the North Koreans know that.
Like many dictatorships before them, they may be the first to believe their own propaganda – in this case, that they can succeed against a South Korean foe that is not buttressed by American military might.
In any case, North Korea – which has invested heavily in forward deployed special forces and other asymmetrical elements of contemporary warfare – seems to be gearing up for an offensive, if only it can get the US out of the way.
Against this background, efforts to bring the Kim regime back to the negotiating table – spearheaded largely by China – are misguided.
Such efforts aim to persuade North Koreans to freeze all missile and nuclear tests, in exchange for a scale-down and delay of annual joint exercises by US and South Korean forces.
Advocates of this so-called “freeze for freeze” approach say that such a tradeoff is only fair: the North cannot be expected to suspend its efforts to strengthen its defensive capabilities if the US and South Korea are pursuing supposedly hostile military cooperation in its near-abroad.
But this argument has it backward.
In fact, it is the North whose activities are inherently hostile, and the South, along with the US, that is focused on defense.
Indeed, planning for the annual US-South Korea spring exercises is always based on the premise that North Korea has invaded the South, not vice versa.
North Korea knows this well.
But North Korea also knows that, without joint exercises, a military alliance becomes weak and hollow.
In 1939, for example, when Germany invaded Poland, the British and French, per their treaty with Poland, declared war on Germany.
But, in reality, they did little to protect Poland, which Germany subjugated rather quickly.
If the US suspends joint military exercises with South Korea, its willingness or ability to respond to North Korean aggression in the South may become similarly weak.
This scenario is all the more dangerous, given the possibility that the suspension of missile and nuclear tests may not actually lead to a concomitant weakening of North Korea’s nuclear program.
Testing is only a small element of a weapons program – and not necessarily an essential one.
There is no sign that the North Koreans would actually end research and development of nuclear weapons.
In fact, the idea that North Korea will abandon its weapons programs in exchange for the promise of security and regime survival has been tested has failed whenever it has been tested.
In September 2005, five world powers, including the US, offered North Korea an unimpeded civilian nuclear program, energy assistance, economic aid, and diplomatic recognition, as well as a promise to establish a regional mechanism for maintaining peace and security in Northeast Asia.
A US commitment not to attack North Korea with conventional or nuclear weapons was also included in the deal.
All North Korea had to do to secure these benefits was abandon its nuclear-weapons programs and accede to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.
But the North was not willing to allow for a credible verification protocol.
Instead, it attempted to limit verification to that which was already known.
In the end, it walked away from the agreement, rather than work to find an acceptable way forward.
A stronger and more purposeful US-China dialogue on North Korea is essential to resolving what is emerging as the world’s most urgent security problem.
But the discussion should focus on direct measures to impede and undermine the country’s inherently aggressive nuclear program – not to offer more concessions that will only strengthen a rogue regime’s hand.
The Only Way Forward on North Korea
SEOUL – Could the world soon witness another devastating war on the Korean Peninsula?
That question looms large in many conversations these days.
Of course, concerns about the North Korean regime’s nuclear-weapons program are nothing new.
The United States first tried to resolve the issue back in 1994, with the US-North Korean Agreed Framework; but that effort gradually collapsed, owing to actions taken – and not taken – on both sides.
Then, in 2006, Kim Jong-il’s regime detonated North Korea’s first nuclear device, and put the issue squarely back on the United Nations Security Council’s agenda.
In the ensuing decade, North Korea has conducted five more nuclear tests – most recently in September – and demonstrated the technological mastery needed to develop advanced thermonuclear weapons.
And, under Kim Jong-un’s leadership, the situation escalated further when the regime began making significant progress toward developing an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) capable of reaching the US mainland.
And this development coincided with the arrival of US President Donald Trump, who has promised a new approach to global affairs.
North Korea has made clear its commitment to developing a long-range nuclear-strike capacity. In the regime’s view, nuclear weapons are its only insurance against attack.
Without them, Kim believes, he would share the fate of others who abandoned their pursuit of nuclear arms, such as Saddam Hussein in Iraq and Muammar el-Qaddafi in Libya.
In this context, the US objective of a denuclearized North Korea disarmed of ICBMs is unachievable by diplomatic means.
And, at any rate, Trump has declared diplomacy a “waste of time,” and ominously warned that “only one thing will work,” though he hasn’t explained what that means.
Given that neither the US nor North Korea has shown any enthusiasm for talks, one could conclude that war is inevitable.
Yet, for all its bellicosity, the North Korean regime is unlikely to start a full-scale military conflict, because that would surely spell its demise.
At the same time, the US has no good first-strike options.
Surgical strikes may sound promising, but they are hardly foolproof.
As US military commanders well know, strikes that failed to eliminate all of North Korea’s nuclear weapons at once could trigger a regional – or even a nuclear – war costing millions of lives.
In the US, those who argue for military action often claim that deterrence will not work against an “irrational” regime.
But there is no reason to assume that Kim is bent on mass suicide.
After all, when Mao’s China made a dash for nuclear weapons in the 1960s, its rationale was little different from that of North Korea today, but no one doubted that deterrence would work.
Still, even assuming that deterrence – embodied in Trump’s threat that the US will “totally destroy” North Korea – does work, it will not prevent a nuclear- and ICBM-armed North Korea from fundamentally altering the strategic calculus in northeast Asia.
The US nuclear deterrent protects the US first and foremost. It remains to be seen if US “extended deterrence” will continue to protect American allies such as South Korea and Japan.
If the US mainland becomes a potential target for a North Korean nuclear strike, then the credibility of deterrence could depend on whether the US is willing to sacrifice San Francisco to save Seoul or Tokyo.
Doubt about the US nuclear umbrella in the region could lead South Korea and Japan to decide to develop their own nuclear options.
In fact, South Korea had a nuclear-weapons program long before North Korea.
That program was abandoned when South Korea signed on to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in 1975, but restarting it has become a subject of debate in Seoul.
Needless to say, further nuclear escalation on the Korean Peninsula would be very dangerous, not least because the Kim regime would feel even more threatened than it already does.
So far, the US approach to North Korea has been to tighten sanctions and outsource the problem to China.
But while China does have strong economic ties to North Korea, it is unclear whether China has the clout to change the Kim regime’s behavior, even if it wanted to.
Success would probably require something close to regime change.
It is thus unwise to rely wholly on China.
Clearly, a broader diplomatic approach is needed, and it should start by addressing a fundamental issue at the heart of the problem: namely, that no peace treaty has ever been signed to end the 1950-1953 Korean War.
A dialogue to replace the 64-year-old armistice with a formal peace agreement could pave the way for broader discussions about nuclear escalation and other threats to regional stability.
And, at a minimum, it could break today’s diplomatic stalemate and give the parties involved more reason to refrain from further provocations.
More broadly, a new round of diplomacy would have to address North Korea’s security concerns, and provide space for the North to evolve politically and economically, as China has done over the past few decades.
This may seem like a distant prospect; but if the security situation on the peninsula is resolved, it would not be out of the question.
The alternative is to continue on the current path and risk a military conflict or a full-scale war.
Even if those worst-case scenarios were averted, the region would have nothing to look forward to but instability for years to come.
The Wrong Way to Prevent Nuclear War
STOCKHOLM – A vast majority of countries want to eliminate the existential threat of nuclear catastrophe, and rightly so.
But achieving a world free of nuclear weapons is easier said than done, and there is a risk that some attempts to do so could prove self-defeating.
Since the end of the Cold War, nuclear stockpiles around the world have been significantly reduced.
Russia and the United States have each shrunk their nuclear arsenals by 80%, and during Barack Obama’s presidency, the US urged Russia to pursue further reductions.
In Western Europe, the United Kingdom and France have both made their already small arsenals even smaller.
These countries had various reasons for reducing their stockpiles.
But, as signatories to the 1968 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) – the foundation of global efforts to reduce the threat posed by nuclear weapons – they also had an obligation to do so.
In recent years, progress toward nuclear disarmament has stalled.
Russia is currently modernizing its strategic nuclear forces, and has started to mention its nuclear capacity more often in public statements.
That explains why efforts to reduce nuclear arsenals in Western Europe have come to a halt.
The US, for its part, is also reviewing its options for modernizing its nuclear arsenal.
Meanwhile, Pakistan has continued to produce the fissile materials used in nuclear weapons.
Efforts to make the Middle East a nuclear-free zone have gone nowhere, largely because of Israel.
The international community could not agree on a way forward at NPT review conferences in 2005 and 2015.
And, of course, North Korea’s nuclear ambitions have created another nuclear crisis in East Asia.
Against this backdrop, a large bloc of countries has proposed a far-reaching Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, a draft of which was endorsed by 122 United Nations member states in early July.
Unfortunately, what started as a worthwhile humanitarian effort has culminated in a severely flawed proposal.
Three issues stand out.
First, since no nuclear states support a nuclear-ban treaty, the current proposal, by itself, would not rid the world of a single nuclear warhead.
Worse, the new treaty could undermine the NPT, which, despite its own flaws, has far wider backing, including that of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council (China, France, Russia, the UK, and the US).
Finally, by treating the concept of extended nuclear deterrence as illegal, or at least immoral, the draft treaty could actually threaten security in Europe and East Asia.
The initial draft treaty, when it was unveiled earlier this year, did not include language explicitly banning the use of nuclear weapons as a deterrent.
But the version that countries voted on in July did.
This is a critical change.
The threat of a nuclear counterstrike is what keeps countries from using nuclear weapons in the first place.
And so-called extended deterrence through alliances is what protects non-nuclear states from being blackmailed by nuclear states.
Without extended deterrence, non-nuclear countries could see fit to acquire nuclear weapons of their own.
It is for this reason that the Netherlands, the only NATO country to participate in developing the nuclear-ban treaty, ultimately voted against it.
Japan, the only country that has ever been attacked with nuclear weapons, has also withheld support for the treaty, because it relies on extended nuclear deterrence from the US.
Without such protection, Japan would be completely vulnerable to Chinese nuclear blackmail and North Korean missile attacks.
Indeed, since diplomacy and deep sanctions have not put an end to North Korea’s nuclear program, nuclear deterrence stands as the only practical way to protect East Asian countries from nuclear blackmail or attack.
Likewise, the vast majority of European countries – from Finland to Portugal – have no wish to reside in the shadow of Russian nuclear warheads with nothing to protect them.
By effectively banning deterrence, the draft treaty could make the world even less safe than it already is.
Of course, proponents of the treaty argue that it would build up public support for a nuclear-weapons ban over time, eventually forcing the governments of nuclear states to give up their arsenals.
But this is pure naiveté.
No one with any connection to reality could seriously believe that the governments of China, Israel, Pakistan, and Russia will simply abandon their nuclear weapons because public opinion has turned against them.
Unfortunately, nuclear weapons are broadly popular in these countries, because they are seen as a security guarantor and a realization of national ambitions on the world stage.
Those of us who want a nuclear-free world do not have to agree with this outlook; but we had better not ignore it.
A more realistic approach would be to pursue further nuclear-weapons reductions in both the US and Russia, where serious risks still need to be addressed.
To that end, it is vital that neither country modernizes its nuclear arsenal in a way that is seen as expanding its nuclear capabilities.
Instead, they must pave the way for further reductions.
In the Middle East, ending current conflicts and developing conflict-resolution mechanisms could help drive progress toward nuclear-free status over time.
In this regard, the nuclear agreement between Iran and the P5+1 (the five permanent members of the UN Security Council, plus Germany) is an important first step.
As for South Asia, one hopes that a détente between India and Pakistan will facilitate better nuclear-arms control, even if the shadow of China – which sees its bomb as part of its place in the world – will still hang over India.
In the end, full-scale nuclear disarmament probably cannot be achieved with a single Big Bang.
The world would be better served by an incremental approach based on the NPT, strategic arms reductions by the major powers, and conflict resolution in key regions.
In the best-case scenario, the proposed nuclear-ban treaty will be just a sideshow.
But there is reason to fear that it will complicate ongoing efforts to reduce nuclear arsenals further, deepen the divide between nuclear- and non-nuclear states, and, in the worst-case scenario, even increase the risk of a nuclear conflict in key regions.
Odiousness Ratings for Public Debt
CAMBRIDGE – On Friday August 25, the US government imposed financial sanctions on Venezuela, restricting the ability of President Nicolás Maduro’s government and its oil company, PDVSA, to issue new debt in American capital markets.
The sanctions were imposed in response to the regime’s unconstitutional and fraudulent election of a constituent assembly and the de facto closure of the constitutionally elected National Assembly, with its two-thirds opposition majority.
Well-functioning markets should have shut down the Maduro regime’s access to finance long ago.
The fact that they didn’t not only shocked the moral sentiments of many, but also revealed a fundamental defect in sovereign debt markets’ institutional architecture.
Little good will come from Venezuela’s economic catastrophe, but one positive outcome would be a reform that puts such markets on a more solid financial – and moral – footing.
All debts imply a commitment by the borrower to repay what was borrowed, with interest.
In the case of public debt, the pacta sunt servanda principle implies that future governments are obliged to respect the commitments assumed by their predecessors.
But, as Alexander Sack argued in 1927, successor governments should not always do so: “When a despotic regime contracts a debt, not for the needs or in the interests of the state, but rather to strengthen itself, to suppress a popular insurrection, etc., this debt is odious for the people of the entire state.”
According to this doctrine, debt incurred by “odious” regimes should not be enforceable, because the lender should have known that the debt was incurred without the consent of the people or for their benefit.
As Sack put it: “This debt does not bind the nation; it is a debt of the regime, a personal debt contracted by the ruler, and consequently it falls with the demise of the regime.”
The odious debt idea was revived in an influential 2006 article by Seema Jayachandran and Michael Kremer, and in a 2010 report by the Center for Global Development (CGD), which proposed that economic sanctions include a mechanism aimed at preventing the accumulation of odious obligations.
The mechanism would take the form of a declaration that debt issued by a particular government would be considered odious.
In effect, this is what the Trump administration has just done.
Such a declaration reduces the flow of funds to odious regimes, owing to the risk that successor governments will renounce their predecessor’s debts without incurring legal and reputational costs (because participating countries’ courts will not enforce the debt contracts).
The CGD report proposes that a regime should be considered odious if it abuses the human rights of the population, employs military coercion, perpetrates electoral fraud, and mismanages or misappropriates public funds.
Clearly, the Venezuelan regime has ticked each of these boxes, making it a poster child for odiousness.
But it did not tick them all at once: the plundering of Venezuela’s wealth, the gross violation of human rights, and the unconstitutionality of its decisions did not begin with the election of the new Constituent Assembly on July 30.
It was a slow process that started many years earlier.
For example, it is difficult to argue that the destruction of the Venezuelan oil industry, which lost almost half its global market share since President Hugo Chávez took power nearly 20 years ago, was carried out in the interest of the Venezuelan people.
And it happened amid the biggest and longest oil-price boom in history, at a time when the country was sitting on the world’s largest reserves and PDVSA was borrowing on a massive scale.
It is even harder to argue that PDVSA’s dollar-denominated debt was legitimate when it was sold for local currency at below-market prices, to politically connected individuals, who often borrowed the needed bolivars overnight from public-sector banks, just to flip the bonds immediately to Wall Street.
As Barclay’s Alejandro Grisanti documented in 2008, beneficiaries pocketed an instant profit equal to 20-30% of the face value of the debt.
None of these considerations prevented the Venezuelan regime from borrowing, often at the ridiculous rate of 50%, as happened in May with Goldman Sachs’s purchase of “hunger bonds.”
It also did not stop institutions such as JP Morgan from including Venezuelan bonds in their emerging-market bond indexes and purchasing more than $1 billion dollars of these bonds for the exchange-traded and mutual funds that it offers to the public as investment vehicles.
That is why we propose the adoption of an odiousness rating system, akin to credit ratings.
While the latter focus on the ability and willingness of the borrower to pay, the odiousness rating would provide an estimate of how likely it is that a court would decide that the debt falls with the regime.
The scale would be continuous, going from, say, O (odious repressive dictatorships) to W (well-managed and fully functioning democracies).
There would be intermediate notches: dictatorships that promote economic development and thus benefit the population (think of South Korea in the 1970s) and corrupt democracies characterized by economic mismanagement and graft (think of Argentina during the Kirchner administration).
Odiousness ratings could become part of soft international law, used by courts when deciding how to enforce debt contracts, and they could help determine which bonds are included in the calculation of emerging-market indexes.
The same country could have bonds which, being issued in different periods, have different odiousness ratings and enforcement probabilities.
Because a more odious rating would reduce investors’ appetite for bonds, downgrades could limit the irresponsible debt accumulation and economic disasters brought about by regimes such as Venezuela’s – and possibly accelerate their demise.
There are many open questions.
Who should issue the rating?
What should the methodology be?
How can the rater be protected from political pressure?
But all of these questions can be answered.
The best way to do that is to start the discussion.
The Pandora’s Box of the Digital Age
STOCKHOLM – Is the world sliding dangerously toward cyber Armageddon?
Let us hope not; but let us also apprehend the threat, and focus on what to do about it.
One country after another has begun exploring options for bolstering their offensive capabilities in cyberspace, and many other countries have already done so.
This is a dangerous escalation.
In fact, few other trends pose a bigger threat to global stability.
Almost all societies have become heavily dependent on the Internet, the world’s most important piece of infrastructure – and also the infrastructure upon which all other infrastructure relies.
The so-called Internet of Things is a misnomer; soon enough, it will be the “Internet of Everything.”
And our current era is not a Fourth Industrial Revolution; it is the beginning of the digital age, and the end of the industrial age altogether.
The digital age has introduced new vulnerabilities that hackers, cyber criminals, and other malign actors are already routinely exploiting.
But even more alarming is the eagerness of national governments to conduct cyber-warfare operations against one other.
We have already reached the stage at which every conflict has a cyber dimension.
The United States and Israel crossed the Rubicon in 2010 by launching the Stuxnet attack on Iran’s nuclear facilities.
Now, there is no telling where ongoing but hidden cyber conflicts begin and end.
Things were different in the old world of nuclear weapons, which are complicated and expensive devices based on technology that only a few highly educated specialists have mastered.
Cyber weapons, by contrast, are generally inexpensive to develop or acquire, and deceptively easy to use.
As a result, even weak and fragile states can become significant cyber powers.
Worse still, cyber-war technologies have been proliferating at an alarming pace.
While there are extensive safeguards in place to control access to sensitive nuclear technologies and materials, there is almost nothing preventing the dissemination of malicious software code.
To understand the scale of the threat we face, look no further than the “WannaCry” virus that, among other things, almost shut down the British National Health Service this past May.
The virus exploited a vulnerability in the Microsoft Windows operating system that the US National Security Agency had already discovered, but did not report to Microsoft.
After this information was leaked or stolen from the NSA, North Korea quickly put the ransomware to use, which should come as no surprise.
In recent years, North Korea has launched numerous cyber attacks around the world, most notably against Sony Pictures, but also against many financial institutions.
And, of course, North Korea is hardly an exception.
Russia, China, and Israel have also developed cyber weapons, which they are busy trying to implant in systems around the world.
This growing threat is precisely why other countries have started talking about acquiring offensive cyber capabilities of their own: they want to have a deterrent to ward off attacks from other cyber powers.
Cyber security is regarded as complicated and costly; but cyber offense is seen as inexpensive and sexy.
The problem is that, while deterrence works in the nuclear world, it isn’t particularly effective in the cyber world.
Rogue actors – and North Korea is hardly the only example – are far less vulnerable than developed countries to cyber counterstrikes.
They can attack again and again without risking serious consequences.
Cyber attacks’ often-ambiguous origins make it even harder to apply a rational theory of deterrence to the cyber world.
Identifying the responsible party, if possible at all, takes time; and the risk of misattribution is always there.
I doubt we will ever see unambiguous proof that Israel is conducting offensive cyber operations; but that certainly doesn’t mean that it isn’t.
In the darkness of cyberspace, sophisticated actors can hide behind oblivious third parties, who are then exposed to counterstrikes by the party under attack.
And in the ongoing conflict among Gulf countries, at least one government may have contracted hackers based in other countries to conduct operations against an adversary.
This method of avoiding detection will almost certainly become the norm.
In a world riven by geopolitical rivalries large and small, such ambiguity and saber-rattling in the cyber realm could have catastrophic results.
Nuclear weapons are generally subject to clear, strict, and elaborate systems of command and control.
But who can control the legions of cyber warriors on the dark web?
Given that we are still in the early stages of the digital age, it is anyone’s guess what will come next.
Governments may start developing autonomous counterstrike systems that, even if they fall short of Dr. Strangelove’s Doomsday Machine, will usher in a world vulnerable to myriad unintended consequences.
Most obviously, cyber weapons will become a staple in outright wars.
The United Nations Charter affirms all member states’ right to self-defense – a right that is, admittedly, increasingly open to interpretation in a kinetic, digitized world.
The Charter also touches on questions of international law, particularly with respect to non-combatants and civilian infrastructure in conflict zones.
But what about the countless conflicts that do not reach the threshold of all-out war?
So far, efforts to establish universal rules and norms governing state behavior in cyberspace have failed.
It is clear that some countries want to preserve their complete freedom of action in this domain.
But that poses an obvious danger.
As the NSA leaks have shown, there is no way to restrict access to destructive cyber weapons, and there is no reason to hope that the rules of restraint that governed the nuclear age will work in the cyber age.
Unfortunately, a binding international agreement to restrict the development and use of offensive cyber weapons in non-war situations is probably a long way off.
In the meantime, we need to call greater attention to the dangers of cyber-weapon proliferation, and urge governments to develop defensive rather than offensive capabilities. An arms race in cyberspace has no winners.
The Abnormality of Oil
LONDON – Writing about oil prices is always risky.
In a January 2015, I suggested that oil prices would not continue to fall, and even predicted that they would “finish the year higher than they were when it began.”
I was wrong then; but I might not be wrong for much longer.
I recently spoke at the massive Abu Dhabi Petroleum Exhibition and Conference (ADIPEC), which is a kind of Davos for oil-market participants.
While there, I caught the tail end of a discussion among senior oil executives who all agreed that at this time next year, crude oil will still be around $60 per barrel, as it is today.
I was about to be interviewed by the CNBC reporter Steve Sedgwick, to whom I said, “That would be a first.
Oil prices hardly moving in a year?”
Needless to say, Sedgwick began the interview by telling the audience what I had said, and quizzed me on why I disagreed with the others.
Before I get to my explanation, let me state the usual caveats.
Forecasting oil prices is inevitably a fraught endeavor; in fact, it makes forecasting currency markets look easy.
When I completed a doctorate on oil markets in the late 1970s and early 1980s, I had already concluded that trying to guess oil prices is a waste of time and energy.
Later, when I was at Goldman Sachs, I was often amused to see commodity analysts in my research group struggling to cope with the usual chaos of oil-price developments.
While interviewing me, Sedgwick raised an interesting point: Given that the volatility of many other asset prices has declined sharply in recent years, it might just be a matter of time before oil and other commodity prices do the same.
To be sure, that could very well happen.
In principle, he is right.
But I would argue that the decline in volatility in currency, bond, and equity markets largely reflects low inflation in many parts of the world, and the lack of significant monetary-policy adjustments by major central banks in recent years.
I’m not sure that these factors apply to oil in the same way, especially at a time when energy markets are on the cusp of big changes in supply and demand.
On the demand side, market commentators are finally waking up to something that has been pretty clear for most of 2017: the world economy has gained momentum, and is now probably growing at a rate of 4% or higher.
With the exception of India and the United Kingdom, eight of the ten largest economies are expanding at the same time.
And even as many countries try to wean themselves off oil, that transition will not happen overnight.
Accordingly, oil markets are adjusting to stronger demand.
On the supply side, the world’s most important marginal supplier of oil, Saudi Arabia, has suddenly drawn a lot of wary eyes.
The Saudi government has been implementing radical changes, both domestically and in its foreign policy, and its reasons for doing so are not entirely clear.
Not surprisingly, market participants suddenly want to add a premium to the price of oil.
In my two speeches at ADIPEC, I shared a slide with trend lines for the Brent crude oil spot price and the five-year forward price.
I have long defaulted to watching the five-year forward price for lack of a more fundamentals-based approach to thinking about the equilibrium price of oil.
As I explained in January 2015, the Brent crude oil spot price is less subject to speculative fluctuations, and is thus a purer approximation of underlying commercial supply and demand factors.
The chart I prepared – which was made before the latest oil-price acceleration in early November – shows the five-year forward oil price picking up after a period of some stability.
With the spot price having now moved above the five-year forward price, one could conclude that a trend change is underway.
For my part, I’m unsure; but I wouldn’t be surprised if it happened.
Let us return to Sedgwick’s question.
While oil prices could be around $60 per barrel in November 2018, my guess is that they will have risen to around $80 per barrel in the meantime.
Sedgwick also asked me how oil companies might be able to make their investment and operational decision-making less beholden to cyclical factors.
Is it possible for oil companies to temper their excitement during periods of rising prices, and not to fall into a malaise when prices are low for lengthy periods?
It’s a tough question.
My answer is that oil companies need to complete the commodity-analysis quest that I started but never finished.
They must come up with a credible method for estimating the underlying equilibrium price of oil.
Then, as soon as the oil price exceeds two standard deviations of that equilibrium, they should start to ignore the fashionable advice of colleagues, analysts, and industry insiders.
China’s Imperial Overreach
HONG KONG – Chinese President Xi Jinping’s tenure has been marked by high ambition.
His vision – the “Chinese dream” – is to make China the world’s leading power by 2049, the centenary of communist rule.
But Xi may be biting off more than he can chew.
A critical element of Xi’s strategy to realize the Chinese dream is the “one belt, one road” (OBOR) initiative, whereby China will invest in infrastructure projects abroad, with the goal of bringing countries from Central Asia to Europe firmly into China’s orbit.
When Xi calls it “the project of the century,” he may not be exaggerating.
In terms of scale or scope, OBOR has no parallel in modern history.
It is more than 12 times the size of the Marshall Plan, America’s post-World War II initiative to aid the reconstruction of Western Europe’s devastated economies.
Even if China cannot implement its entire plan, OBOR will have a significant and lasting impact.
Of course, OBOR is not the only challenge Xi has mounted against an aging Western-dominated international order.
He has also spearheaded the creation of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, and turned to China’s advantage the two institutions associated with the BRICS grouping of emerging economies (the Shanghai-based New Development Bank and the $100 billion Contingent Reserve Arrangement).
At the same time, he has asserted Chinese territorial claims in the South China Sea more aggressively, while seeking to project Chinese power in the western Pacific.
But OBOR takes China’s ambitions a large step further.
With it, Xi is attempting to remake globalization on China’s terms, by creating new markets for Chinese firms, which face a growth slowdown and overcapacity at home.
With the recently concluded OBOR summit in Beijing having drawn 29 of the more than 100 invited heads of state or government, Xi is now in a strong position to pursue his vision.
But before he does, he will seek to emerge from the National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party later this year as the country’s most powerful leader since Mao Zedong.
Since taking power in 2012, Xi has increasingly centralized power, while tightening censorship and using anti-corruption probes to take down political enemies.
Last October, the CCP bestowed on him the title of “core” leader.
Yet Xi has set his sights much higher: he aspires to become modern China’s most transformative leader.
Just as Mao helped to create a reunified and independent China, and Deng Xiaoping launched China’s “reform and opening up,” Xi wants to make China the central player in the global economy and the international order.
So, repeating a mantra of connectivity, China dangles low-interest loans in front of countries in urgent need of infrastructure, thereby pulling those countries into its economic and security sphere.
China stunned the world by buying the Greek port of Piraeus for $420 million.
From there to the Seychelles, Djibouti, and Pakistan, port projects that China insisted were purely commercial have acquired military dimensions.
But Xi’s ambition may be blinding him to the dangers of his approach.
Given China’s insistence on government-to-government deals on projects and loans, the risks to lenders and borrowers have continued to grow.
Concessionary financing may help China’s state-owned companies bag huge overseas contracts; but, by spawning new asset-quality risks, it also exacerbates the challenges faced by the Chinese banking system.
The risk of non-performing loans at state-owned banks is already clouding China’s future economic prospects.
Since reaching a peak of $4 trillion in 2014, the country’s foreign-exchange reserves have fallen by about a quarter.
The ratings agency Fitch has warned that many OBOR projects – most of which are being pursued in vulnerable countries with speculative-grade credit ratings – face high execution risks, and could prove unprofitable.
Xi’s approach is not helping China’s international reputation, either.
OBOR projects lack transparency and entail no commitment to social or environmental sustainability.
They are increasingly viewed as advancing China’s interests – including access to key commodities or strategic maritime and overland passages – at the expense of others.
In a sense, OBOR seems to represent the dawn of a new colonial era – the twenty-first-century equivalent of the East India Company, which paved the way for British imperialism in the East.
But, if China is building an empire, it seems already to have succumbed to what the historian Paul Kennedy famously called “imperial overstretch.”
And, indeed, countries are already pushing back.
Sri Lanka, despite having slipped into debt servitude to China, recently turned away a Chinese submarine attempting to dock at the Chinese-owned Colombo container terminal.
And popular opposition to a 15,000-acre industrial zone in the country has held up China’s move to purchase an 80% stake in the loss-making Hambantota port that it built nearby.
Shi Yinhong, an academic who serves as a counselor to China’s government, the State Council, has warned of the growing risk of Chinese strategic overreach.
And he is already being proved right.
Xi has gotten so caught up in his aggressive foreign policy that he has undermined his own diplomatic aspirations, failing to recognize that brute force is no substitute for leadership.
In the process, he has stretched China’s resources at a time when the economy is already struggling and a shrinking working-age population presages long-term stagnation.
According to a Chinese proverb, “To feed the ambition in your heart is like carrying a tiger under your arm.”
The further Xi carries OBOR, the more likely it is to bite him.
Measuring the Internet for Freedom
ROME – Last year, during a wave of deadly political protests in Ethiopia, the government blocked more than 15 media websites and the smartphone chat application WhatsApp.
Sites promoting freedom of expression and LGBTQ+ rights, as well as those offering censorship-circumvention tools, such as Tor and Psiphon, were also suppressed.
All of this was uncovered through the use of software called ooniprobe, which is designed to measure networks and detect Internet censorship.
Ooniprobe was developed more than five years ago by the Tor-supported Open Observatory of Network Interference (OONI), with which I work, in order to boost transparency, accountability, and oversight of Internet censorship.
The software is free and open source, meaning that anyone can use it.
And, indeed, tens of thousands of ooniprobe users from more than 190 countries have already done just that.
Those users have contributed to the collection of millions of network measurements, all of which are published on OONI Explorer, arguably the largest publicly available resource on Internet censorship.
Thanks to their use of ooniprobe, we uncovered the extent of last year’s wave of censorship in Ethiopia, as well as details of many other cases of censorship elsewhere in the world.
In Uganda, local groups used ooniprobe during last year’s general election, when the government blocked social media.
Ooniprobe’s network-measurement data not only confirmed the government’s action; it also uncovered which sites were blocked and the different methods used by Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to implement censorship.
Ooniprobe also came in handy in Malaysia in 2015.
Facing accusations that he had transferred nearly $700 million from the state investment fund 1MDB to his personal bank accounts, Prime Minister Najib Razak attempted to block news outlets and blogs that reported on the scandal.
It was ooniprobe’s network-measurement software that enabled Malaysian civil-society groups to collect data that serve as evidence of the blocking.
Of course, censorship is not always carried out to protect the politically powerful; it can also be used to reinforce social and cultural norms.
In Indonesia, for example, low social tolerance for homosexuality may have played a role in the blocking of numerous LGBTQ+ websites, even though the country does not officially restrict LGBTQ+ rights.
Similar factors may have influenced efforts to block sites perceived as overly critical of Islam.
In Thailand, ISPs have, in the last three years, blocked access to a number of sites that are perceived to be offensive toward the country’s royal family.
But, here, there is a legal justification: Thailand’s strict prohibition against lèse-majesté protects the royal family’s most senior members from insult or threat.
Other cases of legally justified Internet censorship include the blocking of sexually explicit websites in countries where pornography is prohibited.
Then there are cases where the motivation for censorship is unclear.
Why, for example, has an online dating site been blocked in Malaysia?
In some countries, ISPs appear to be censoring sites at their own discretion.
According to ooniprobe data, multiple Thai ISPs simultaneously blocked access to different types of websites – from news outlets to Wikileaks to pornography – indicating that they likely received vague orders from authorities.
Before ooniprobe, such censorship was difficult to detect, leading to a lack of accountability, with governments and ISPs often denying any and all involvement.
Even in cases where governments announce official lists of blocked sites, they may leave some targets off.
Likewise, ISPs may not always comply with official orders to lift blocks.
Vimeo and Reddit, for example, were recently found to be blocked in some networks in Indonesia, even though the official ban on those sites was lifted more than two years ago.
With ooniprobe, users are not only able to expose Internet censorship; they can also acquire substantial detail about how, when, where, and by whom the censorship is being implemented.
OONI’s Web-Connectivity Test, for example, is designed to examine whether access to websites is blocked through DNS tampering, TCP/IP blocking, or a transparent HTTP proxy.
Other ooniprobe tests are designed to examine the accessibility of chat apps – namely, WhatsApp, Telegram, and Facebook Messenger – within networks, as well as that of censorship-circumvention tools, such as Tor, Psiphon, and Lantern.
OONI also provides software tests that uncover the presence of systems (“middle boxes”) that could potentially be responsible for censorship or surveillance.
The depth of OONI data supports much-needed accountability and oversight.
Lawyers can use OONI data to assess the legality of Internet censorship in their countries, and potentially introduce it as evidence in court cases.
Journalists, researchers, and human-rights defenders can use the data to inform their work as well.
And censorship-circumvention projects like Tor can use OONI findings on emergent censorship events to shape their tools and strategies.
OONI data can help enrich public discourse about the legality, necessity, and proportionality of Internet censorship.
That makes it a critical tool for safeguarding human rights on the Internet and beyond.
The EU’s Mafia State
BUDAPEST – Following the collapse of communism, many of us in Central and Eastern Europe had hoped that the region would steadily move toward liberal democracy, and that any obstacles en route to that goal could be overcome.
But in many former communist countries, older systems of patronage and corruption have survived, and taken new forms.
What we thought was a transitional phase has become a permanent state of affairs.
Consider Hungary, which has become a mafia state during the seven years of Viktor Orbán’s rule as prime minister.
Hungary is unique in that it moved toward liberal democracy and joined the European Union before changing course and heading toward autocracy.
The rest of the region’s mafia states, such as Russia, Azerbaijan, and other Central Asian former Soviet republics, either passed through a period of oligarchic flux, or took a direct path from communist dictatorship to criminal enterprise.
In these countries, oligarchs and the organized underworld have not captured the state; rather, an organized “upperworld” of elites have captured the economy, including the oligarchs themselves.
The result is a mix between a criminal organization and a privatized, parasitic state.
Most analyses of post-communist autocracies tend to focus on the political institutions and ideologies underpinning the state.
But while these regimes make populist appeals, they are not driven by ideology. Their primary concern is to consolidate the ruler’s power and personal wealth through whatever means necessary.
In today’s mafia states, key decisions are made through informal mechanisms created by the regime, instead of through formal institutions.
In terms of structure and culture, these arrangements resemble an adopted family, which the regime creates by systematically replacing political and economic elites.
In a democracy, these elites would be autonomous actors.
But in a mafia state, their position is subsumed in a system of patron-client dependency, often through regime-led corporate raiding and rent-seeking.
The classic mafia technique of physical coercion is thus replaced with a bloodless, “legal” form of compulsion overseen by public authorities.
To be sure, corruption is endemic in other post-communist countries that have joined the EU, such as Romania and Bulgaria.
But because these countries have proportionate election systems and divided executive power, no central patronage network has emerged.
Unlike Jarosław Kaczyński, Poland’s fanatically ideological de facto leader, Orbán is a cynic.
The type of autocratic regime that he is trying to establish in Hungary is very different from Kaczyński’s in Poland, despite the ideological similarities.
Whereas Orbán’s regime seeks wealth, and is sustained by an adopted political family that operates outside the constraints of formal institutions, Kaczyński is conducting a conservative-autocratic experiment that is driven as much by ideology as by the quest for power.
In Hungary’s 2010 parliamentary election, Orbán’s Fidesz party won 53% of the vote, and 263 of the National Assembly’s 386 seats.
Orban used this strong position to alter the constitution, appoint loyal followers to democratic institutions that otherwise would have checked his power, and manipulate election laws to cement his rule.
In the 2014 parliamentary election, Fidesz needed just 44% of the votes to maintain control.
Orbán’s mafia state will be very hard to dismantle.
Its pyramidal patronage network, similar to that created by Vladimir Putin in Russia, appears to be nearly indestructible.
In Ukraine, it should be noted, revolutions have been required – first under Leonid Kuchma, and then under Viktor Yanukovych, to prevent such a system from being established (whether a third attempt is currently underway today remains to be seen).
It will be impossible to vote Orbán out of power as long as he can manipulate Hungary’s elections.
Fidesz has tightened its control over the judiciary and politicized law enforcement, by turning the Chief Prosecutor’s office into what is essentially an arm of the party.
Moreover, most newspapers and radio stations are now owned by oligarchs close to Orbán, and state television has become a vehicle for government propaganda.
The common values that the EU was established to uphold have been fatally undermined in Hungary.
In response, the EU could have the European Court of Human Rights investigate Hungary’s violations of EU rules, or an EU-level prosecutor could bring civil or criminal actions against Hungary’s misuse of EU funds.
But, so far, the EU has been reluctant to take serious punitive action against Orbán’s regime, because it does not want to risk pushing Hungary further into Russia’s embrace.
And the EU’s tacit acceptance of a “multi-speed Europe” implies that it can live with a buffer zone of semi-autocratic member states on its eastern border.
Accordingly, Orbán now presides over what he proudly calls an “illiberal democracy” that is spearheading an “Eastern opening.”
His strategy vis-à-vis the EU is tantamount to blackmail.
He demands that EU funds be provided with no strings attached, while signaling that he would gladly sell his loyalty to Russia.
As the Hungarian writer Miklós Haraszti has said, Hungary is “drifting in a Western boat propelled by an Eastern wind.”
Now that the law of rule has supplanted the rule of law, Hungary’s democratic ship may have already sailed.
Dealing with Damaging Institutional Inertia
LONDON – Deeply rooted, credible, accountable, and effective institutions have long been deemed crucial for a society’s lasting wellbeing and prosperity.
They shield countries from frequent and unsettling volatility, be it economic, political, or social, and they reduce the risk of costly shocks.
But, nowadays, key political and economic institutions are being pressured by unusual fluidity in their operating environments and the effects of a cumulative loss of trust on the part of their constituencies.
The implications vary, with a much higher probability of adaptation, including through a relatively orderly process of creative destruction and re-creation, for private entities compared to public ones.
The latter require an intensification of reform efforts, lest they constitute another obstacle to the global economy’s ability to deliver high and inclusive growth on a lasting basis.
Like a well-designed, well-functioning road network, strong institutions empower economies by ensuring a stable operating environment, smoother transmission mechanisms, less costly and less risky economic interactions, a credible set of property rights, and respect for the rule of law.
They act not only as enablers of a wide range of win-win relationships, but also as trusted gatekeepers.
Accordingly, for decades such institutions were widely viewed as the main feature differentiating advanced economies from developing countries that are still subject to a much larger array of damaging cyclical and structural shocks.
In recent years, however, this characterization has been challenged, as the standing of private and public institutions with significant systemic influence has declined.
For an expanding set of private firms, the main source of pressure has been technological, particularly those advances underpinned by the increasingly powerful mix of artificial intelligence, big data, and mobility.
The challenge has proven particularly severe, if not fatal, for those facing intense competition from entrants able to combine disruptive content and big platforms – the most notable examples being Amazon, Facebook, Google, Netflix, and Uber.
As illustrated by the increased regulatory interest they are now attracting, as well as the increased media attention devoted to various controversies (such as those relating to “fake news” and internal corporate cultures), these companies must adapt and remain agile as they gain greater systemic influence and notice.
The adjustment process is even trickier for public institutions, especially given their wide-ranging roles as gatekeepers, enablers, and regulators.
Often embodying the properties of “natural monopolies,” they are not only shielded from disruption but can also repress and delay beneficial innovations.
Internal inertia, incomplete information, risk aversion, and conscious and unconscious biases combine to impede recognition of the urgency and importance of adaptation.
Even more benign shortcomings – such as slowness in modernizing laws to catch up to changing realities – detract from economic wellbeing.
The visible and persistent failure of education systems to adopt exciting technological breakthroughs is a well-known example of this inertia.
Less obvious is the lag among economic institutions in updating policy approaches, including through faster incorporation of important insights and tools from behavioral science, AI, neuroscience, and other disciplines. Then there are the persistent slippages in skill acquisition programs.
As a result, there has been a notable erosion of trust in the effectiveness of public institutions.
And the damage to their credibility risks further undermining their effectiveness and perpetuating a vicious circle set in motion by their failure to generate high and inclusive growth.
Our understanding of how public institutions should adapt and reform is still evolving. As such, a complete solution is yet to emerge.
But a few imperatives are already clear.
·         Limit harm, including by resisting the natural inclination to promulgate increasingly ineffective, albeit established approaches, entities, and mindsets.
·         Be much more open to the lessons that can be learned from external disruptors, and be willing to revisit the underpinnings of processes and entire business models.
·         Enhance public-private interactions, not just for direct content, but also as a way to broaden the scope for greater cross-fertilization of best practices.
·         Improve methods of public communications, lest continued information failures, aging channels, and the cumulative erosion of trust compound operational shortcomings.
Up to now, too many inherently influential institutions have lagged in identifying and implementing reforms.
This has amplified the disappointment, alienation, and marginalization felt by segments of the population vis-à-vis governments that do not hear or respond to a deeply entrenched fear of economic insecurity.
It is a phenomenon that has been many years in the making, that cannot be eliminated overnight, and that increasingly fuels social and political disruptions.
Institutions matter, especially in a period of economic, political, and social fluidity.
The longer it takes to restore confidence in key public and, to a lesser extent, private institutions, the greater the impediments to our wellbeing and that of our children.
The Pakistani Mecca of Terror
BERLIN – Almost seven decades after it was created as the first Islamic republic of the postcolonial era, Pakistan is teetering on the edge of an abyss.
The economy is stagnant, unemployment is high, and resources are scarce.
The government is unstable, ineffective, and plagued by debt.
The military – along with its rogue Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) agency, comprising the country’s spies and secret policemen – is exempt from civilian oversight, enabling it to maintain and deepen its terrorist ties.
Nuclear-armed Pakistan is now at risk of becoming a failed state.
But even if it does not fail, the nexus between terrorist groups and Pakistan’s powerful military raises the specter of nuclear terrorism – a menace so large that the United States has prepared a contingency plan to take out the country’s fast-growing nuclear arsenal should the need arise.
Make no mistake: Pakistan is “ground zero” for the terrorist threat the world faces.
The footprints of many terrorist attacks in the West have been traced to Pakistan, including the 2005 London bombings and the 2015 San Bernardino killings.
Two key actors behind the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in the United States – Osama bin Laden and Khalid Sheik Mohammed – were found ensconced in Pakistan.
In the recent Manhattan and New Jersey bombings, the arrested suspect, Ahmad Khan Rahami, was radicalized in a Pakistan seminary located near the Pakistani military’s hideout for the Afghan Taliban leadership.
But it is Pakistan’s neighbors that are bearing the brunt of its state-sponsored terrorism.
Major terrorist attacks in South Asia, like the 2008 Mumbai strikes and the 2008 and 2011 assaults on the Indian and US embassies in Afghanistan, respectively, were apparently orchestrated by the ISI, which has reared terrorist organizations like Lashkar-e-Taiba, Jaish-e-Mohammad, and the Haqqani network to do its bidding.
This is no hearsay; former Pakistani military dictator Pervez Musharraf has largely acknowledged it.
In India, in particular, the Pakistani military – which, despite being the world’s sixth largest, would have little chance of winning a conventional war against its giant neighbor – uses its terrorist proxies to wage a clandestine war.
This year alone, Pakistani military-backed terrorists have crossed the border twice to carry out attacks on Indian military bases.
In January, Jaish-e-Mohammad struck India’s Pathankot air base, initiating days of fighting that left seven Indian soldiers dead.
Last month, members of the same group crossed the border again to strike the Indian army base at Uri, killing 19 soldiers and prompting India to carry out a retaliatory surgical strike against militant staging areas across the line of control in disputed and divided Kashmir.
Afghanistan and Bangladesh also accuse ISI of undermining their security through terrorist surrogates.
They blame Pakistan for the recent grisly attacks in their respective capitals, Kabul and Dhaka, in which a university and a café were among the targets.
Such activities have left Pakistan isolated.
Just recently, its regional neighbors – Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal, and Sri Lanka – pulled the plug on a South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation summit that was scheduled for early next month in Pakistan’s capital, Islamabad.
Sri Lanka’s prime minister, Ranil Wickremesinghe, has warned that “cross-border terrorism” imperils the very future of SAARC.
But diminished international standing and growing regional isolation have been insufficient to induce Pakistan’s dominant military to rethink its stance on terrorism.
One reason is that Pakistan retains some powerful patrons.
Beyond receiving financial support from Saudi Arabia, Pakistan has, in some ways, become a client of China, which provides political protection – even for Pakistan-based terrorists – at the United Nations Security Council.
This month, China torpedoed, for the fifth time in two years, proposed UN sanctions on Masood Azhar, the Pakistan-based head of Jaish-e-Mohammed, which the UN designated as a terrorist outfit years ago.
The sanctions were backed by all other members of the Security Council’s anti-terror committee, not least because India had presented evidence linking Azhar to the terrorist killings at its two military bases.
In terms of financial aid, however, it is the US that serves as Pakistan’s biggest benefactor.
Yes, even after finding the likes of Bin Laden on Pakistani soil, the US – the country that has spearheaded the so-called War on Terror – not only continues to deliver billions of dollars in aid to Pakistan, but also supplies it with large amounts of lethal weapons.
US President Barack Obama’s administration also opposes a move in Congress that would officially brand Pakistan a state sponsor of terrorism.
This approach reflects Obama’s commitment to using inducements to coax the Pakistani military to persuade the Taliban to agree to a peace deal in Afghanistan.
But that policy has failed.
The US remains stuck in the longest war in its history, as a resurgent Taliban carries out increasingly daring attacks in Afghanistan with the aid of their command-and-control structure in – you guessed it – Pakistan.
No counterterrorism campaign has ever succeeded when militants have enjoyed such cross-border havens.
Achieving peace in Afghanistan, like stemming the spread of international terrorism, will be impossible without making the Pakistani military accountable to the country’s civilian government.
The US has a lot of leverage: Pakistan has one of the world’s lowest tax-to-GDP ratios, and is highly dependent on American and other foreign aid.
It should use that leverage to ensure that the Pakistani military is brought to heel – and held to account.
The War on Secrecy
LONDON – What do the recently released Panama papers, ExxonMobil, and a Canadian mining company operating in Guatemala have in common?
They are all cases in which powerful individuals and organizations tried to obfuscate, deceive, or hide behind a front.
And they are all cases in which that effort didn’t work.
The global uproar triggered by the Panama Papers – 11.5 million files taken, apparently by computer hackers, from the world’s fourth-largest offshore law firm, Panama’s Mossack Fonseca – is likely to continue for some time.
The files’ release has revealed the extreme, and sometimes costly, lengths that individuals go to hide their assets and avoid taxation.
What has been uncovered thus far ranges from legal but ethically suspect use of tax loopholes to efforts to stash or launder money gained through corruption or other illegal activities.
The reaction has been swift, harsh, and almost universally excoriating.
Already, the prime minister of Iceland has been forced to resign, after it was revealed that he held stakes in offshore companies with his wife.
Relatives of senior Chinese officials, including President Xi Jinping, as well as members of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s inner circle, have been implicated as well.
Xi and Putin may have little to worry about.
But the sheer hypocrisy of government officials proclaiming the need for austerity and encouraging public sacrifice for the sake of long-term prosperity, while secretly avoiding that effort, is a galling violation of trust in democratic countries.
If their offshore shell companies and bank accounts are legal, why go to so much trouble to be secretive?
And if secrecy is legal, what is wrong with it?
Meanwhile, corporate secrecy has placed ExxonMobil in the crosshairs of the attorneys general of New York, Massachusetts, and the Virgin Islands, and many more states are waiting in the wings.
The investigation is focusing on whether the company knowingly made false statements about climate change, starting from the 1980’s.
Internal documents indicate that Exxon, and later ExxonMobil, knew about the damaging effects of climate change but revealed no information to investors or the public.
In fact, the company’s public statements – including as recently as last year – routinely dismissed the risk of climate change.
When given an opportunity to come clean and operate transparently, ExxonMobil opted for obfuscation.
In Canada, Hudbay Minerals is embroiled in a lawsuit that could open the door to real consequences for companies that offload onto subsidiaries all responsibility for their overseas operations.
Instead of applying their home countries’ ethical requirements and standards in the countries where they operate, Western companies draw a veil of subsidiaries, contractors, and supply chains over behavior that consumers and investors would consider reprehensible.
Hudbay Minerals is being sued over an episode of mass rape and property destruction in Guatemala, after soldiers and people claiming to be security officials from the company that owned a local mine arrived in a small village with orders to evict its residents.
The case is seemingly complex, as it involved multiple owners, numerous subsidiaries, and an array of jurisdictions.
But the principle at stake is simple: A parent company must be held responsible for overseeing the actions of those representing it.
Creating layer upon layer of ownership to preserve secrecy must not continue.
And it will not if a three-prong approach is embraced.
Call it the carrot, the stick, and fresh air.
The carrot – the inducement to behave ethically – should be to recognize and reward those who admit past mistakes and demonstrate the will and an effective strategy to correct them.
The stick – punishment of misconduct – requires stricter enforcement of legal and ethical requirements, whether concerning tax avoidance and evasion, or the ability to hide behind subsidiaries.
And fresh air takes the form of reporting, whether drawing attention to wrongdoing in local communities or deep investigative reports, like the extraordinary global effort by the hundreds of journalists who cooperated in bringing the Panama Papers to light.
This approach must not be turned into a marketing exercise by companies, government officials, or media companies.
Instead, the repudiation of secrecy should resemble a truth and reconciliation process, with wrongdoers providing a full public account of their behavior, perhaps accompanied by testimony from victims.
Most important, if corporate boards – and the lawyers, bankers, and accountants who advise companies and individuals – are to be vigilant about legal and ethical compliance, they must believe that they will be held accountable for their actions.
Once everyone gets the message that secrecy carries unacceptably large risks, they will act in ways that minimize those risks.
Whether they like it or not, it is time for our leaders to behave in ways that are good for them – and us.
The Paris Approach to Global Governance
WASHINGTON, DC – As a former president of the American Society of International Law, I should bemoan the recent Paris agreement on climate change as a failure.
By the standards of a traditional treaty, it falls woefully short.
Yet its deficits in this regard are its greatest strengths as a model for effective global governance in the twenty-first century.
The international legal gold standard is a treaty, a binding document that can be enforced by courts and arbitration tribunals.
Such agreements comprise more than expressions of intent; they contain codified, enforceable rules, along with sanctions for non-compliance.
Indeed, they must be ratified by national parliaments, so that they become a part of domestic law.
The Paris agreement is none of these things.
In the United States, as a matter of domestic law, it is an executive agreement, binding only on President Barack Obama’s administration.
An executive-legislative agreement would have the same status as a treaty, except that a treaty must be ratified by two-thirds of the Senate, whereas an executive-legislative agreement must be adopted by the Senate and the House under the same rules that apply to all domestic legislation.
An executive agreement made by one administration is not necessarily binding on its successor, but it would have to be explicitly repudiated.
Moreover, unlike in a traditional international treaty, the obligations of the Paris agreement are not fixed.
The point of carefully negotiating international agreements is that once they become law, they cannot be changed, except through formally agreed amendment processes.
That permanence gives them authority.
Yet the 195 signatories to the Paris agreement created a non-binding system for raising their individual obligations every five years.
In other words, the parties are encouraged – but not required – to submit increasingly stringent revisions of their so-called Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs), based on their own judgment.
The Paris agreement also abandons the idea of “compliance” as a stamp of legality or illegality.
The historic job of international lawyers and tribunals has been to determine whether a signatory to an international agreement is complying with its obligations.
The Paris agreement essentially substitutes transparency for compliance, creating an “enhanced transparency framework” designed “to build mutual trust and confidence and to promote effective implementation.”
A subsequent article of the agreement does create a compliance mechanism, but specifies that it will be “expert-based” – meaning that assessment teams will include climate scientists and policy experts, as well as lawyers.
Furthermore, it will be “facilitative,” functioning in a manner that is “transparent, non-adversarial, and non-punitive.”
That sounds more like a support group than a disciplinary committee.
In short, by traditional international legal standards, the Paris agreement is essentially a statement of good intentions, setting forth aspirational goals to limit global temperature rise to 2° Celsius – or, ideally, 1.5°C – above pre-industrial levels.
It is as far as could be from the Treaty of Vienna, the Treaty of Versailles, or even the treaties banning landmines and establishing the International Criminal Court.
And that is precisely why it has a good chance of working.
For starters, tackling a problem as complex and fast-moving as climate change would be impossible with permanent, binding commitments.
By the time an agreement could be hammered out – if it could be hammered out – the scale and features of the problem, not to mention the technologies that could be used to address it, would have changed.
The new kind of global governance that the Paris agreement exemplifies, which substitutes rolling processes for fixed rules, is far better suited to the kinds of global problems we face today.
Likewise, in a world of 195 diverse countries – from the desperately poor or conflict-ridden to the highly developed – top-down obligations can never be uniform enough to work.
Relying on bottom-up INDCs, which require the citizens and governments of each individual country to come together to determine what they can reasonably achieve, is far more promising.
But perhaps the most important shift made in the Paris agreement is from selective coercion to collectively supported competition.
Instead of suing one another for failure to comply with a legal obligation, countries will try to outdo one another in their efforts to help address a shared problem.
The transparency mechanism supports this shift, by allowing journalists, activists, scientists, concerned citizens, and climate-friendly businesses to engage in debates, publicize successes and failures, solicit help and advice, and offer support to lagging countries.
This highlights the final crucial feature of the new global governance model exemplified by the Paris agreement: The deal reached earlier this month, like the Conference of the Parties itself, is not only for governments.
Although the agreement calls on governments to continue providing public finance through the official Green Climate Fund, individuals and entities are also playing a major role.
For example, Bill Gates made global headlines during the negotiations when he announced a $2 billion fund to invest in clean energy, financed by the Breakthrough Energy Coalition, a group of 26 global philanthropists and the University of California.
The BEC heralds a new level of public-private partnership, with the investors working with the governments of some 20 countries – including the China, India, and the US – that already account for roughly 80% of global investment in clean energy and have now pledged to double their investments.
Negotiators in Paris recognized that business, philanthropy, civil society, academia, and ordinary people all have a role to play in addressing a major global challenge.
Change is happening even on the government side, with municipal authorities often significantly outpacing their national counterparts, operating through vehicles like the C-40, a “network of the world’s megacities committed to addressing climate change.”
The Paris agreement is a sprawling, rolling, overlapping set of national commitments brought about by a broad conglomeration of parties and stakeholders. It is not law.
It is a bold move toward public problem solving on a global scale.
And it is the only approach that could work.
A Climate Cure Worse than the Disease
JAIPUR – Two years after the Paris climate agreement was signed, the French capital this month again attracted the world’s good and great, who gathered for President Emmanuel Macron’s One Planet Summit.
In turns blasting US President Donald Trump for withdrawing from the Paris accord and telling each other that it remains on track, politicians formed a self-congratulatory huddle with celebrity campaigners and business leaders.
We should treat such smug bonhomie with caution.
Goodwill isn’t enough to stop climate change, and history is littered with well-meaning policies that turned out to be unhelpful, or even worse than the problems they were meant to address.
One particularly harrowing example was Mao Zedong’s attempt to improve crop yields and health by eradicating sparrows.
The population of locusts ballooned, contributing to a famine that claimed around 30 million lives.
But no government is immune.
US President Bill Clinton admits that his landmark  “three strikes” crime law in 1994 backfired by jailing so many people “there wasn’t enough money left to educate them, train them for new jobs, and increase [their] chances when they came out.”
In the following decade, it seemed prudent for the United States to keep its worst Iraqi prisoners in one camp – but this is now blamed for helping future Islamic State leaders learn how to plot.
Often, policy flaws become apparent only in retrospect.
To identify them in real time, we need to be able to undertake a calm analysis of costs and impacts.
No topic requires this more than climate change.
Consider this month’s summit in Paris, where attention focused either on the Trump administration’s absence, or on other world leaders’ defiance of him.
Nowhere have we heard about the Paris agreement’s actual costs and effects.
Economic science helps us establish the scale of the problem. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the UN’s climate panel, estimates that in about 60 years, global warming will cost the planet between 0.2% and 2% of GDP.
That’s a problem, but it’s not the end of the world.
Right now, the net cost of global warming is actually close to zero.
This seems untrue, because we hear an onslaught of terrible climate-related news.
But we don’t get the full picture.
A drought in Syria understandably makes news.
But global warming overall means more precipitation.
Globally, an overview by the journal Nature finds that droughts have been decreasing since 1982.
Thus, while global warming might have contributed to some droughts, overall it has reduced more drought; but an absence of droughts hardly generates headlines.
Similarly, we hear concern that tropical forests are being stripped.
But while this deserves attention, the bigger story is that, because more carbon dioxide fertilizes vegetation, climate change has actually increased the world’s green matter (plants of all sorts) since 1982 by the equivalent of an entire continent.
The best estimates thus show that global warming right now has about a zero net cost.
(The most pessimistic study finds a cost of 0.3% of GDP, the most optimistic a net benefit of 2.3%.)
That will rise to 2% in a half-century, and to 3-4% early in the twenty-second century, if we don’t act.
But the climate policies lauded in Paris are essentially high-cost, low-effect gestures.
The European Union will devote 20% of its budget this year to climate-related action.
Taking into account the total cost to the economy, the EU’s bill will likely be around €209 billion ($240 billion).
The benefit will be vanishingly small.
Accounting for the EU’s commitments to reduce CO2 emissions under the Paris accord up to 2030, my peer-reviewed analysis shows that in the most optimistic scenario, emissions targets, fully achieved and adhered to throughout this century, would prevent just 0.096°F (0.053°C) of global warming by 2100.
That small impact is not a sufficient reason to dump the EU’s emissions-reduction policy.
But it should force us to consider whether the cure is costlier than the disease – and ask what other approaches might be better.
Another peer-reviewed study shows that each dollar spent on EU climate policies will generate a total long-term climate benefit of just three cents.
And, despite the cheer coming from France, the Paris accord is just as off-balance: at a $1-2 trillion annual cost, the United Nations itself estimates that it is on track to achieve 1% of what would be needed to keep temperature rises under 2°C.
We need smarter, cheaper options.
My think tank, the Copenhagen Consensus, asked 27 of the world’s top climate economists to explore all the feasible policy responses, and we concluded that the best long-term investment is in green energy research and development.
For every dollar spent, $11 of climate damage would be avoided.
That makes much more sense than spending a fortune on CO2 cuts that do next to nothing.
Countries should ease up on their current, inefficient climate policies and instead increase spending on green R&D. Only innovation can shift the price of future green energy below fossil fuels, thereby impelling everyone to switch.
We also need cheap, effective adaptation, to avoid the worst climate damage.
And the main source of vulnerability to future climate damage is poverty: the poor will be hit the hardest, as they are by every other global challenge.
So, lifting people out of poverty will help more than anything else.
Despite lofty rhetoric from Paris, all the best intentions on the planet will count for little if it turns out that our climate “solution” was just another policy that cost the planet far more than it gained.
Radical Realism About Climate Change
BERLIN – Mainstream politics, by definition, is ill equipped to imagine fundamental change.
But last December in Paris, 196 governments agreed on the need to limit global warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels – an objective that holds the promise of delivering precisely such a transformation.
Achieving it will require overcoming serious political challenges, reflected in the fact that some are advocating solutions that will end up doing more harm than good.
One strategy that has gained a lot of momentum focuses on the need to develop large-scale technological interventions to control the global thermostat.
Proponents of geo-engineering technologies argue that conventional adaptation and mitigation measures are simply not reducing emissions fast enough to prevent dangerous warming.
Technologies such as “carbon capture and storage” (CCS), they argue, are necessary to limit damage and human suffering.
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change seems to agree.
In its fifth assessment report, it builds its scenarios for meeting the Paris climate goals around the concept of “negative emissions” – that is, the ability to suck excess carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere.
But this approach ignores serious problems with the development and deployment of geo-engineering technologies.
Consider CCS, which is the process of capturing waste CO2 from large sources like fossil-fuel power plants and depositing it in, say, an underground geological formation, thereby preventing it from entering the atmosphere.
It sounds good.
But what makes it economical is that it enables enhanced oil recovery.
In other words, the only way to make CCS cost-effective is to use it to exacerbate the problem it is supposed to address.
The supposed savior technology – bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) – is not much better.
BECCS begins by producing large amounts of biomass from, say, fast-growing trees which naturally capture CO2; those plants are then converted into fuel via burning or refining, with the resulting carbon emissions being captured and sequestered.
But bioenergy is not carbon neutral, and the surge in European demand for biomass has led to rising food commodity prices and land grabs in developing countries.
These realities helped persuade the scientists Kevin Anderson and Glen Peters recently to call carbon removal an “unjust and high-stakes gamble.”
What about other geo-engineering proposals?
Solar Radiation Management (SRM) aims to control the amount of sunlight that reaches the Earth, essentially mimicking the effect of a volcano eruption.
This may be achieved by pumping sulphates into the stratosphere or through “marine cloud brightening,” which would cause clouds to reflect more sunlight back into space.
But blasting sulphates into the stratosphere does not reduce CO2 concentrations; it merely delays the impact for as long as the spraying continues.
Moreover, sulphate injections in the northern hemisphere could cause serious drought in the Africa’s Sahel region, owing to dramatic reductions in precipitation, while some African countries would experience more precipitation.
The effect on the Asian monsoon system could be even more pronounced.
In short, SRM could severely damage the livelihoods of millions of people.
If geo-engineering can’t save us, what can?
In fact, there are a number of steps that can be taken right now.
They would be messier and more politically challenging than geo-engineering.
But they would work.
The first step would be a moratorium on new coal mines.
If all currently planned coal-fired power plants are built and operated over their normal service life of 40 years, they alone would emit 240 billion tons of CO2 – more than the remaining carbon budget.
If that investment were re-allocated to decentralized renewable-energy production, the benefits would be enormous.
Moreover, with only 10% of the global population responsible for almost 50% of global CO2 emissions, there is a strong case to be made for implementing strategies that target the biggest emitters.
For example, it makes little sense that airlines – which actually serve just 7% of the global population – are exempt from paying fuel taxes, especially at a time when ticket prices are at an historic low.
Changes to land use are also needed.
The 2009 International Assessment of Agricultural Knowledge, Science and Technology for Development charts the way to a transformed agricultural system – with benefits that extend far beyond climate policy.
We must apply this knowledge around the world.
In Europe, the waste sector could make a significant contribution to a low-carbon economy.
Recent research, commissioned by Zero Waste Europe, found that optimal implementation of the European Commission’s “circular economy package” waste targets could save the European Union 190 million tons of CO2 per year.
That is the equivalent of the annual emissions of the Netherlands!
Available measures in the transport sector include strengthening public transportation, encouraging the use of railways for freight traffic, building bike paths, and subsidizing delivery bicycles.
In Germany, intelligent action on transport could reduce the sector’s emissions by up to 95% by 2050.
Another powerful measure would be to protect and restore natural ecosystems, which could result in the storage of 220-330 gigatons of CO2 worldwide .
None of these solutions is a silver bullet; but, together, they could change the world for the better.
Geo-engineering solutions are not the only alternatives.
They are a response to the inability of mainstream economics and politics to address the climate challenge.
Instead of trying to devise ways to maintain business as usual – an impossible and destructive goal – we must prove our ability to imagine and achieve radical change.
If we fail, we should not be surprised if, just a few years from now, the planetary thermostat is under the control of a handful of states or military and scientific interests.
As world leaders convene for the 22nd United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change to bring the Paris agreement into force, they should repudiate geo-engineering quick fixes – and demonstrate a commitment to real solutions.
Why Renewables Are Not Enough
NEW DELHI – At the United Nations in New York on April 22, world leaders ratified the global climate agreement reached in Paris last December.
One hundred ninety-five countries, ranging from richest to poorest, have now agreed to limit global warming to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels, with the goal of not exceeding 1.5°C. They have also committed to “intended nationally determined contributions” (INDCs) to limit or reduce greenhouse-gas emissions by 2030.
This is a major achievement, but it is far from sufficient.
In fact, even if all INDC targets were achieved, the world would still be heading toward eventual warming of some 2.7-3.4°C above pre-industrial levels.
To keep warming well below 2°C, emissions in 2030 must be more than 30% below those envisaged in the INDCs.
This will be an enormous challenge, given the need for major strides in economic development over the same period.
Before this century is over, we should seek to enable all the world’s people – probably more than ten billion by then – to achieve the standards of living currently enjoyed only by the wealthiest 10%.
That will require a huge increase in energy consumption.
The average African, for example, today uses about one-tenth of the energy used by the average European.
But by 2050, we must reduce energy-related emissions by 70% from 2010 levels, with further cuts needed to achieve net zero emissions by 2060.
Meeting those objectives will require both an improvement in energy productivity (the amount of income produced per unit of energy consumed) of at least 3% per year and the rapid decarbonization of energy supply, with the share of zero-carbon energy increasing by at least one percentage point each year.
This implies a massive acceleration of national efforts.
Over the last decade, energy productivity has grown by only 0.7% annually, and the share of zero-carbon energy rose by only 0.1 percentage point per year.
Moreover, even if the INDCs were fully implemented, these annual growth rates would reach only 1.8% and 0.4 percentage points, respectively.
Impressive progress is already being made in one crucial area: electricity generation.
Solar power costs have fallen 80% since 2008.
In some places, new supply contracts have set prices as low as $0.06 per kilowatt hour, making solar power fully competitive with coal and natural gas.
Between now and 2030, the INDCs indicate that renewable-power capacity will grow four times faster than fossil-fuel capacity, with 70% of this new renewables investment in emerging and developing economies.
That investment needs to be matched by accelerated progress in battery technology, or by other tools to match electricity demand to intermittent supply.
But there is no doubt that, by mid-century, the world can build a cost-effective zero-carbon electricity system.
And yet zero-carbon power, though hugely important, is insufficient, because electricity currently accounts for only 20% of global energy consumption.
Broader changes to the global energy system are needed.
Road transport and aviation, which currently rely almost entirely on liquid fossil fuels, account for 30% of total energy consumption.
Decarbonization of these activities will require either electrification or the use of hydrogen or biofuels.
This is certainly feasible, but it will take time.
Heating buildings is another area where major changes are needed.
Here, the more widespread use of zero-carbon electricity, instead of fossil-fuel-based energy, could have a major impact.
But there are also important opportunities to design and construct buildings and cities that are substantially more energy-efficient.
With the world’s urban population expected to increase by 2.5 billion by 2050, it is vital that we grasp them.
Energy use by heavy industry energy, however, presents challenges that are often ignored.
Metals, chemicals, cement, and plastics are vital building blocks of the modern economy, and involve processes that cannot be easily electrified.
Decarbonization may instead require the application of carbon capture and storage technologies, while newly designed building materials could reduce demand for carbon-intensive inputs.
Given these challenges, fossil fuels will undoubtedly play a role in transport and heavy industry for some time to come, even as their role in electricity generation declines.
And, even in electricity generation, emerging economies’ INDCs imply significant new investments in coal or gas capacity.
Taken together, the INDCs suggest that coal could still account for 35% of global electricity generation in 2030.
But that level of coal generation is likely to be incompatible with the below-2°C target.
And, because coal- and gas-fired power stations last 50 years or more, such investments raise the risk of either locking in emission levels incompatible with the climate target, or forcing major asset write-offs.
The challenge now is to find an economically sensible path that enables emerging economies to fulfill their growing energy needs, while ensuring that the world meets its climate objectives.
It is technologically possible.
But it will require action by many very different actors.
Governments have a vital role to play, but so, too, do incumbent fossil-fuel-based energy companies and new-entrant companies deploying or developing new technologies.
NGOs can help to identify required policies and hold governments and companies to account.
Individual consumers are also important, because their behavior shapes energy demand.
Despite their varied backgrounds, economic interests, and points of view, all of these actors must engage in an informed debate that recognizes all of the complexities of the challenge ahead.
The shared objective is clear: to build a low-carbon economy that can keep global temperatures well within 2°C of pre-industrial levels, while delivering prosperity for a world of ten billion people or more.
The Climate-Change Fight Returns to Paris
PARIS – Nearly two years have passed since France’s then-foreign minister, Laurent Fabius, struck his gavel and declared: “The Paris agreement for the climate is accepted.”
Next week, President Emmanuel Macron and the French government will host world leaders and non-state actors for the One Planet Summit.
The purpose of this gathering is to celebrate climate gains made since 2015, and to boost political and economic support for meeting the goals and targets of the Paris agreement.
The Paris climate agreement, a historic feat of diplomacy that ushered in a new era of international climate collaboration, was facilitated by a number of political and social forces.
One of the most influential of these was a group of more than 100 countries known as the “high ambition coalition,” which helped finalize the deal in the waning days of the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP21).
This diverse coalition of leaders – from the richest countries to the most vulnerable Pacific island states – broke a political deadlock that had impeded climate progress for years, if not decades.
As we reflect on that success, one thing is abundantly clear: the need for ambitious coalitions has returned.
Strong global leadership on climate change scored a diplomatic victory two years ago, and today, new economic and political alliances are needed to turn those commitments into action.
The diplomatic success of the Paris accord is worthy of praise in its own right; it was a remarkable leap forward in the fight against climate change.
But we must not rest on our laurels.
With the United States, the world’s largest historical emitter of greenhouse gases, dismissive of the accord, the rest of the global community must reaffirm its commitment to reducing carbon dioxide emissions. Dramatic, meaningful, and immediate steps must be taken.
The best available science estimates that the world has only three years to begin a permanent reduction in greenhouse-gas emissions if there is to be any hope of achieving the Paris accord’s goal of keeping warming to “well below 2°C” relative to pre-industrial levels.
And, whatever urgency science cannot convey is being communicated by the planet itself – through a ferocious display of hurricanes, floods, wildfires, and deadly droughts.
Given the immediacy of the challenge, what can and should be done to avert crisis?
Solutions start with money, and a main objective of the One Planet Summit is to mobilize public and private financing to fund projects that can reduce climate-changing pollution today.
During the summit’s “Climate Finance Day,” companies, banks, investors, and countries will announce new initiatives to help fund the costly transition to a carbon-free future.
Hollow promises will have no place at this gathering; only real commitments of real money for tangible projects will be discussed.
As a result, we hope to see hundreds of millions of dollars committed by governments to fund solutions across all fronts of the climate-change battle.
Plenty will go to renewable-energy projects, but money will also be committed to clean transportation, agriculture, infrastructure, and urban systems. Funding will also be earmarked for projects that help protect communities that are most vulnerable to the impact of global warming.
The One Planet Summit will be an occasion for countries, companies, and private institutions to forge concrete strategies to shift away from fossil fuels.
At the UN climate talks in Bonn, Germany, last month, 20 countries, led by Canada and the United Kingdom, announced plans to phase out coal from electricity generation.
The gathering in Paris will provide an opportunity for other countries to join the Powering Past Coal Alliance, which aims to formalize a deliberate transition from coal, and to help companies achieve net-zero emissions.
Ultimately, next week’s summit should be a place where governments, businesses, investors, and other key stakeholders collaborate and share ideas, showcase successful projects, and coordinate goals.
This event should not stand alone, but rather serve as a springboard for international meetings that will take place over the next few years.
After all, it is during this short timeframe that the fate of the Paris accord’s temperature targets will be determined.
Two years after the adoption of a groundbreaking climate agreement, global leaders are set to reconvene in the City of Light.
When they arrive, their collective ambition will be needed once more.
This time, however, the goal must be to ensure that past agreements amount to more than just words on a page.
Ukraine’s Imperiled Press Freedom
NEW YORK – On July 20, 2016, Pavel Sheremet, a prominent Belarusian-born journalist, was heading to work at the studios of Radio Vesti in Kyiv when the Subaru he was driving blew up at a busy intersection.
Nearby windows shook, and birds scattered into the air.
Sheremet, 44, died almost instantly, and the Ukraine Prosecutor’s Office quickly confirmed that a bomb had caused the explosion.
But one year later, Sheremet’s murder remains unsolved.
Had this been a random car bombing, my organization, the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), would not have spent the last year investigating it or pushing the Ukrainian government for a full inquiry.
But Sheremet was a tireless advocate for transparency and democracy, working as a journalist first in his native Belarus, then in Russia, and most recently, in Ukraine.
Until his murder is solved, the truth that he sought in life will elude his countrymen in his death.
Murder is the ultimate form of media censorship.
When journalists are slain, self-censorship seeps into the work of others.
And when a country – especially a country like Ukraine, which aspires to European Union membership – fails to bring the killers to justice, its stated commitment to democracy and the rule of law rings hollow.
That is where things stand with Sheremet’s case.
Over the last year, Ukrainian officials have made many pledges, but have made no arrests, identified no suspects, and presented no convincing motive for the killing.
As CPJ found during a recent weeklong advocacy mission to Kyiv, the lingering impunity has hurt the media’s ability to cover sensitive issues, including corruption, abuse of power, and the ongoing conflict in eastern Ukraine.
Indeed, press freedom in Ukraine has come under increasing attack in the year Sheremet was murdered.
Investigative journalism is branded unpatriotic, and reporters who challenge official policies, as Sheremet did every day, are threatened, harassed, or placed under surveillance.
Ukrainian officials insist they are still working Sheremet’s case.
President Petro Poroshenko, who met with a CPJ fact-finding delegation on July 11, said he remains committed to bringing the killer(s) to justice.
Poroshenko even proposed adding an international partner to his government’s investigation, which could invigorate the probe.
But while this is a welcome move, it comes very late, and after months of missteps that have shaken the public’s trust.
Factually incorrect statements from top officials, including Ukraine’s interior minister, Arsen Avakov, have undermined the credibility of the investigation.
Avakov has alleged Russian involvement in Sheremet’s murder and suggested that the case is unlikely to be solved.
But in meetings with investigating agencies, the CPJ was told that Avakov has limited access to investigation files, and that his statements are unsupported by evidence.
Our delegation was also told that the authorities are examining several motives, but have not ruled out – or pinpointed – any single one.
Why, then, does Avakov continue to make contradictory statements and indulge in poorly sourced conjecture?
Equally worrying are reports that the investigation has been plagued by shoddy police work, including a failure to question key witnesses, check surveillance camera footage, or adequately explain the presence of a former internal security officer at the scene the night before the murder.
The editor-in-chief of Ukraine’s leading independent news website, Ukrainska Pravda, told CPJ that in the months before his death, Sheremet and his partner, Olena Prytula, the site’s co-founder, had been under surveillance.
Moreover, the staff had received threats clearly meant to stop them from reporting on specific, sensitive stories.
Yet Ukrainian authorities have not adequately responded to CPJ’s questions about their investigation of these allegations.
Taken together, these omissions and unexplained events raise serious questions about the integrity and legitimacy of the Ukrainian-led investigation.
If Poroshenko is serious about solving Sheremet’s murder, changes are needed.
Ukrainian officials must establish a clear hierarchy and assign someone to be responsible for resolving the case.
Moreover, Poroshenko should publicly commit more resources to the investigation, and forcefully condemn any attack on journalists.
And, most challenging of all, a new investigative ethos is needed to reduce the risk of departmental bias, especially if evidence points toward official or government entities, as some suggest it might.
Despite the president’s renewed engagement, we are not yet convinced that the Ukrainian government will pursue this case with the vigor it demands.
That is why external pressure is also needed.
The European Union is in a unique position to apply it.
The EU, in declaring Ukraine a priority partner for deeper political and economic ties, has the leverage to hold the Ukrainian government to account.
In 2014, the bloc pledged €12.8 billion ($15 billion) to Ukraine to bolster several key sectors, including law and civil society.
Progress in both fields would be set back significantly by a failure to reach a conclusion in the Sheremet case.
Sheremet spent more than two decades reporting in three post-Soviet countries, and was relentless in uncovering corruption wherever he reported.
For his tenacity, CPJ awarded him our International Press Freedom Award in 1998.
But he was also threatened, imprisoned, attacked, and stripped of his citizenship in Belarus.
Indeed, while Sheremet had many friends, who adored his charismatic personality, wit, and contagious optimism, he also had his share of enemies, who detested his uncompromising journalism.
Five years ago, Sheremet moved to Ukraine because he thought he would find a freer, safer environment in which to work.
Today, as attacks on the media continue in his adopted homeland, and with his own murder unsolved, the faith he placed in Ukraine is not being repaid.
Education Cannot Wait
LONDON – “Recall the face of the poorest and weakest man you have seen, and ask yourself if this step you contemplate is going to be any use to him.”
These words, spoken by Mahatma Gandhi in 1948, should be taken as a test of our sincerity, and as a challenge to our complacency, when considering the fate of the 30 million children displaced from their homes by civil wars and natural disasters.
More boys and girls have been uprooted by crisis than at any time since 1945.
They are likely to spend their school-age years without entering a classroom, their talents undeveloped and their potential unlocked.
There are now 75 million young people whose education has been interrupted by conflict and crisis.
Yet urgency – and international law, which mandates the education of all displaced children – fails to inspire action.
Displaced children are more likely to become the youngest laborers in the factory, the youngest brides at the altar, and the youngest soldiers in the trench.
Without opportunity, children are vulnerable to extremists and radicalization.
Every year, close to a half-million girls are trafficked and vanish.
The fate of these dispossessed is tethered to the thinnest of lifelines.
When disaster strikes, what can only be described as a begging bowl is handed around the world’s donor community.
Voluntary contributions are then administered by refugee agencies, charities, and NGOs, which heroically help refugees scrape by with the bare essentials – food, water, shelter, and protection.
In such circumstances, the right to education becomes an unaffordable “luxury.”
While UN Peacekeepers are funded by assessed contributions levied on member countries, the millions of children displaced by crises have no guarantee that anyone will fund their schooling.
Indeed, less than 2% of humanitarian aid reaches education.
Syria’s civil war, now entering its sixth year, and the first anniversary of Nepal’s devastating earthquake – two disasters that have forced millions more children into the streets – serve as painful reminders that we lack the means to return children to the classroom in the wake of such tragedies.
A permanent fund securing education for children in emergency situations is long overdue.
Instead of wasting months begging for aid, such a reserve fund would be capable of delivering it immediately.
At the onset of an emergency, the fund would swiftly assess where dispossessed children are, develop a strategy, and put in place a plan to provide education for them.
Now, for the first time, we are in a position to deliver on this promise.
Under the leadership of UNICEF Executive Director Anthony Lake, UNESCO Director-General Irina Bokova, UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi, Chair of the Global Partnership for Education Julia Gillard, and World Bank President, Jim Yong Kim – and with the support of the UN Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon – an unprecedented humanitarian fund for education in emergencies is about to be established.
The new “Education Cannot Wait” fund will respond to new realities and requirements.
Most child refugees are likely to spend more than a decade out of their own countries, so their plight cannot be considered temporary.
The breakthrough fund will support the education of refugees for up to five years, instead of the mere months of patchwork provisions that are presently on offer.
No longer will humanitarian, security, and development needs be split into silos with their own addresses and agendas.
A single fund will now meet these needs at once.
After all, when refugee children find a place in school, they are more secure, their parents are more hopeful, and their states are more stable.
The fund will not be bound by old World Bank rules that, until recently, excluded the education of refugee children in middle-income countries from concessional loans.
The initiative will be the first official humanitarian fund for education.
And a parallel UN-led fund will have distinct windows through which businesses, foundations, and individuals can contribute.
To be sure, delivering an education to displaced children demands a departure from pure voluntarism: a shift toward assessed contributions collected by levies from wealthy countries.
But, until this shift occurs, we will ask individual philanthropists, corporations and charities – as well as new and old aid donors – to come together to catalyze the venture.
Our sense of urgency, coupled with the requisite funds, promises to have a significant impact.
When it comes to securing schooling, no price tag is too steep.
The fund will harness today’s passions and key innovations.
We want technology firms to play a central role in providing new ideas and disruptive thinking.
We want firms that already offer refugees an online education, internet access and IT hardware to drive the provision of education to displaced and isolated girls and boys.
In establishing this fund, we are ending the era of the formulaic crisis response.
It was Gandhi’s belief that reflection could motivate action by recalibrating our moral compass.
What makes this fund unique is not the series of new benchmarks it sets.
Rather, it signals a change in how we meet the challenges of an emergency.
Going beyond present demands, the fund is based on the needs of the future.
In providing resources to deliver education, the fund is a bold affirmation of a better tomorrow – an unwavering promise to unlock talent, develop potential, and secure futures for all children, wherever they are.
By establishing “Education Cannot Wait”, we are sending a message to the downcast and dispossessed everywhere.
Education, at its best, offers something that food, shelter, and healthcare can never themselves provide: hope, the chance to plan, and to prepare for the future.
Your Data or Your Life
LONDON – Apple’s new watch keeps track of your health.
Google Now gathers the information needed to compute the ideal time for you to leave for the airport.
Amazon tells you the books you want, the groceries you need, the films you will like – and sells you the tablet that enables you to order them and more.
Your lights turn on when you get close to home, and your house adjusts to your choice of ambient temperature.
This amalgamation and synthesis of digital services and hardware is designed to make our lives easier, and there is no doubt that it has.
But have we stopped asking fundamental questions, both of ourselves and of the companies we entrust to do all of these things?
Have we given sufficient consideration to the potential cost of all of this comfort and ease, and asked ourselves if the price is worth it?
Every time we add a new device, we give away a little piece of ourselves.
We often do this with very little knowledge about who is getting it, much less whether we share their ethics and values.
We may have a superficial check-box understanding of what the companies behind this convenience do with our data; but, beyond the marketing, the actual people running these organizations are faceless and nameless.
We know little about them, but they sure know a lot about us.
The idea that companies can know where we are, what we have watched, or the content of our medical records was anathema a generation ago.
The vast array of details that defined a person was widely distributed.
The bank knew a bit, the doctor knew a bit, the tax authority knew a bit, but they did not all talk to one another.
Now Apple and Google know it all and store it in one handy place.
That is great for convenience, but not so great if they decide to use that information in ways with which we do not proactively agree.
And we have reason to call into question companies’ judgment in using that data.
The backlash to the news that Facebook used people’s news feeds to test whether what they viewed could alter their moods was proof of that.
I do not recall checking a box to say that that was okay.
Recently, hackers misappropriated photos sent via Snapchat, a service used primarily by young people that promises auto-deletion of all files upon viewing.
Likewise, health-care data were always considered private, so that patients would be open and honest with health-care professionals.
As the lines between health care and technology businesses become hazy, some manufacturers of “wearables” and the software that runs on them are lobbying to have their products exempted from being considered medical devices – and thus from regulatory requirements for reliability and data protection.
Privacy is only one part of a larger discussion around data ownership and data monopoly, security, and competition.
It is also about control and destiny.
It is about choice and proactively deciding how people’s data are used and how people use their own data.
More mature firms have phased in formal protocols, with ethics officers, risk committees, and other structures that oversee how data are collected and used, though not always successfully (indeed, they often depend on trial and error).
Small new companies may have neither such protocols nor the people – for example, independent board members – to impose them.
If serious ethical lapses occur, many consumers will no longer use the service, regardless of how promising the business model is.
We like new applications and try them out, handing over access to our Facebook or Twitter accounts without much thought about the migration of our personal data from big companies with some modicum of oversight to small companies without rigorous structures and limits.
Consumers believe or expect that someone somewhere is keeping an eye on this, but who exactly would that be?
In Europe, legislation to protect personal data is not comprehensive, and much of the rest of the world lacks even rudimentary safeguards.
After exploring this issue with legislators in several countries over the past couple of months, it has become abundantly clear that many do not have a full grasp of the myriad issues that need to be considered.
It is a difficult subject to address, and doing so is impeded by lobbying efforts and incomplete information.
In the short term, young companies should view ethics not as a marketing gimmick, but as a core concern.
All organizations should invest in ethics officers or some sort of review process involving people who can assess all of the implications of a great-sounding idea.
Legislators need to educate themselves – and the public – and exercise more oversight.
For example, just as many countries did with car seatbelts a generation ago, a public-safety campaign could be paired with legislation to explain and promote two-step verification.
In the longer term, as we rightly move toward universal Internet access, we need to ask: How much of ourselves are we willing to give away?
What happens when sharing becomes mandatory – when giving access to a personal Facebook account is a job requirement, and health services are withheld unless a patient submits their historical Fitbit data?
If that is the future we want, we should stride toward it with full awareness and a sense of purpose, not meander carelessly until we fall into a hole, look up, and wonder how we got there.
Is There A Right To Secede?
BARCELONA – The European Union has brought 28 countries into a closer political and economic union.
Paradoxically, it has also made it more feasible to contemplate the breakup of some of those countries.
Independence for a small state outside of a political and economic group like the EU would be risky nowadays.
Within the EU, however, the barriers between states – and thus the economic and political risks of independence – are lower.
Consider Scotland, where a popular referendum on independence will be held on September 18.
The referendum is the result of the landslide victory by the Scottish National Party in the 2011 Scottish Parliament election.
British Prime Minister David Cameron has argued against Scotland leaving the United Kingdom, but he has not opposed holding the referendum.
Opinion polls taken since the wording of the referendum (“Should Scotland be an independent country?”) was announced indicate that the “yes” side is unlikely to gain a clear majority.
In Spain, there is a national debate about independence for Catalonia, where national identity is strengthened by the fact that the majority of the region’s residents speak Catalan as well as Spanish.
By contrast, only about 1% of Scots can speak Scottish Gaelic.
Perhaps as a result, support for independence in Catalonia appears to be far broader, with about half of the region’s residents saying that they support secession.
But the Spanish parliament voted overwhelmingly against allowing the Catalan government to hold a referendum on independence, and the central government has said that such a vote would be unconstitutional.
Artur Mas, President of Catalonia’s regional government, has vowed to go ahead with a non-binding referendum anyway.
If a majority of the voters in a distinct region of a country favor independence, does that mean that they have a right to secede?
There are surely more questions that need to be addressed than that single one.
What if a region’s secession leaves behind a rump state that is no longer viable?
Within the EU, this is less of an issue, given that small states – in theory – still benefit from free trade within the Union; but, outside of the EU, the situation of the remaining state can be dire.
In September 1938, Hitler threatened to attack Czechoslovakia in order to bring the ethnic Germans living near the German border under his rule.
The Munich Agreement gave this region, referred to by the Nazis as the Sudetenland, to Germany, leaving Czechoslovakia without defensible borders and paving the way for the Nazi invasion and partition of the country the following March.
Had a free and fair referendum been offered to the Sudeten Germans, a majority might have backed union with Germany.
But would that have given them the right to leave the remainder of Czechoslovakia defenseless against its large and hostile neighbor?
The UK and Spain do not need to fear that independence for Scotland and Catalonia would expose them to such threats.
Nonetheless, the secession of Scotland would deprive the UK of significant North Sea oil revenues, on which the economics of Scottish independence largely relies, and Spain could also suffer from the loss of Catalonia’s disproportionately large contribution to the Spanish economy.
Widespread human rights violations, either caused or tolerated by a national government, can give rise to what is sometimes called a remedial right to secession for a region’s inhabitants.
If other remedies fail in such a situation, secession might be justified as a last resort, even if it imposes heavy costs on the rump state.
That was the case when Bangladesh seceded from Pakistan, and it was also allegedly the case when NATO supported Kosovo’s independence from Serbia.
But this is not true of Scotland or Catalonia; nor, despite Russian propaganda, does it appear to be the case for those regions of Ukraine with ethnic Russian majorities.
If Scotland and Catalonia ever become independent countries, it will only be because the UK and Spain permit it.
All states have an interest in stability, so it is hard to imagine that, in the absence of widespread, grave, and undeniable human rights violations, other states would recognize a region that, after being part of a state for many centuries, declared itself independent without the acquiescence of the country from which it secedes.
The EU is also unlikely to accept Scotland or Catalonia as a member if the UK or Spain rejects their claims to independence.
Indeed, European Commission President José Manuel Barroso has said that the EU may reject Scotland and Catalonia’s applications, or at least delay them considerably, even if the UK and Spain do accept their independence.
And, without EU membership, it is hard to imagine that a majority of people in Scotland or Catalonia would take the plunge into economic uncertainty that independence would bring.
The role of a referendum in a region seeking to secede can therefore only be a form of persuasion aimed at the government of the existing state.
A large turnout showing a clear majority for independence would be a way to say: See how strongly we feel about this issue.
We are so dissatisfied with the status quo that most of us now favor secession.
If you want us to stay, you need to address the grievances that have caused a majority of us to want to leave.
The Eternal Return of the Plague
NORMAN, OKLAHOMA – “Fearsome Plague Epidemic Strikes Madagascar.”
That recent New York Times headline might sound like the synopsis of a horror movie.
The epidemic gripping Madagascar is not just any plague, and it certainly isn’t some Hollywood apocalypse.
It’s the plague, caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis, agent of the notorious bubonic plague.
For most people, “the plague” conjures up images of the medieval Black Death, and perhaps a vaguely reassuring sense that, in the developed world, such ancient dangers are long past.
But in recent years, thanks to the work of geneticists, archaeologists, and historians, we now know that human civilization and the plague have a much deeper and more intimate association than previously assumed.
Lessons learned from studying this historic interaction could reshape how we think about global public health today.
All infectious diseases are caused by pathogens – bacteria, viruses, protozoa, and parasites – that are capable of subverting our immune systems long enough to make us sick.
These organisms are the product of their own biological evolution, and the history of the plague’s development is perhaps (along with maybe HIV) the most detailed biography of any pathogen known to science.
The plague bacterium, in its most destructive form, is about 3,000 years old.
It evolved in Central Asia as a rodent disease; humans were accidental victims.
From the germ’s point of view, people make poor hosts, because we die quickly and are usually a terminus, not a transmitter.
The plague is spread principally by the bite of fleas, and a few thousand years ago, the bacterium acquired a genetic mutation that made it ferociously effective at spreading.
This adaptation improved the plague’s biological fitness, which, for rodents – and the humans who live near them – has proven to be a nightmare.
Thanks to new genomic evidence, we can say with greater confidence how long this nightmare has been recurring.
One of the most surprising and solidly confirmed findings in recent years has been the prevalence of plague in samples from Stone Age and Bronze Age societies in Europe and Central Asia.
While it remains unclear what role plague played in the failure of those societies, it is reasonable to assume that the disease has long influenced human history.
What is now beyond question is that Yersinia pestis was indeed the pathogen responsible for two of the most destructive pandemics ever.
The Black Death, which lives on in popular imagination to this day, arrived from Central Asia in the 1340s, and in the space of a few years, wiped out roughly half of the population in the regions it struck.
The disease then lingered for a few more centuries, killing many more.
But this entire episode is properly known as the “second pandemic.”
The first pandemic began in AD 541, during the reign of the Roman Emperor Justinian.
The outbreak is known as the Justinianic plague, and, like the Black Death, it cut a swath of destruction from inner Asia to the shores of the Atlantic in the space of a few years.
Total mortality was in the tens of millions, and stupefied contemporaries were certain they were living on the verge of the last judgment.
As with the Black Death, later historians questioned whether a rodent disease could cause destruction on such a scale.
But in recent years, the pathogen’s genetic traces have been found in sixth-century graves, and the DNA evidence convicts Yersinia pestis of this ancient mass murder as definitively as it would in a modern courtroom.
The plague triggered a demographic crisis that helped to topple the Romans’ “eternal empire.”
Plague pandemics were events of mind-boggling ecological intricacy.
They involved a minimum of five species, in perilous alignment: the bacterium itself, the reservoir host such as marmots or gerbils, the flea vector, the rodent species in close quarters with humans, and the human victims.
The germ first had to leave its native Central Asia.
In the case of the Justinianic plague, it seems to have done so by exploiting the shipping networks in the Indian Ocean.
Once within the Roman Empire, it found an environment transformed by human civilization, along with massive colonies of rodents fattened on the ancient world’s ubiquitous granaries.
Human expansion helped rodents prosper, and rat infestations, in turn, intensified and prolonged the plague’s outbreak.
There is tantalizing evidence that climate change also played a role in triggering the first pandemic.
Just a few years before the appearance of the plague on Roman shores, the planet experienced one of the most abrupt incidents of climate change in the last few thousand years.
A spasm of volcanic explosions – in AD 536, when historians reported a year without summer, and again in AD 539-540 – upset the global climate system.
The precise mechanisms by which climate events fueled plague remain contested, but the link is unmistakable, and the lesson is worth underscoring: the complex relationship between climate and ecosystems impacts human health in unexpected ways.
The plague in Madagascar today is an offshoot of what is known as the “third plague pandemic,” a global dispersion of Yersinia pestisthat radiated from China in the late nineteenth century.
There still is no vaccine; while antibiotics are effective if administered early, the threat of antimicrobial resistance is real.
That may be the deepest lesson from the long history of this scourge.
Biological evolution is cunning and dangerous.
Small mutations can alter a pathogen’s virulence or its efficiency of transmission, and evolution is relentless.
We may have the upper hand over plague today, despite the headlines in East Africa.
But our long history with the disease demonstrates that our control over it is tenuous, and likely to be transient – and that threats to public health anywhere are threats to public health everywhere.
Water Management Is Health Management
LONDON – With climate change accelerating and its effects exacerbating other geopolitical and development crises, the role of environmental protection in preserving and improving human wellbeing has become starkly apparent.
This recognition lies at the heart of the concept of “planetary health,” which focuses on the health of human civilization and the condition of the natural systems on which it depends.
The concept’s logic is simple: if we try to deliver better health to a growing population, without regard for the health and security of our natural resources, we will not just struggle to make new strides; we will reverse the progress already made.
Where things get complicated is in applying the concept, particularly when addressing the nexus of water services, health, and ecosystem integrity.
Since at least 1854, when John Snow discovered that cholera was spread through contaminated water supplies in central London, humans have understood that polluted water is bad for our health.
The degradation of freshwater ecosystems often brings disease, just as the protection or strengthening of such ecosystems improves health outcomes.
But, while it is now well understood that progress in one area improves outcomes in another, such co-beneficial dynamics often are insufficient to spur investment in both areas.
For example, investing to protect a watershed can also protect biodiversity and improve water quality in associated rivers, thereby benefiting human health.
But if the goal is explicitly to improve human health, it might be more cost-effective simply to invest in a water-treatment plant.
A more compelling dynamic is complementarity: when investment in one area increases the returns on investment in other areas.
In this scenario, investments in protecting a watershed would aim not just to produce returns directly, but also to boost the returns of simultaneous investments in human health.
Complementarity produces mutually reinforcing dynamics that improve outcomes across the board.
A well-functioning water sector already attempts to balance complementary interventions.
Indeed, such a system amounts to a multidisciplinary triumph of human ingenuity and cooperation – involving engineering, hydrology, governance, and urban planning – with far-reaching complementary impacts on both human health and economic development.
In 1933, through the Tennessee Valley Authority Act, the United States established an agency whose purpose was to build hydroelectric dams on the Tennessee River.
That effort benefited industry, agriculture, flood control, and conservation throughout the Tennessee Valley watershed, until then one of the country’s most disadvantaged regions.
Since then, governments worldwide have recognized the potential of water infrastructure to complement other economic and social policies, including those intended to improve health outcomes.
It is no coincidence that one of the World Bank’s largest lending portfolios – $35 billion worth of investments – comprises water projects.
But understanding the potential of complementarity is just the first step.
To maximize results, we must design a coherent strategy that takes full advantage of the dynamic, at the lowest possible cost.
The question is whether there is an optimal mix of environmental protection and direct health interventions on which policymakers can rely to maximize investment returns for both.
A recent analysis suggests that, in rural areas, a 30% increase in upstream tree cover produces a 4% reduction in the probability of diarrheal disease in children – a result comparable to investing in an improved sanitation facility.
But, if that is true, we have yet to determine at what point reforestation becomes a better investment than improving sanitation, let alone increases the returns of other health interventions by the highest possible amount.
Another study found that an estimated 42% of the global malaria burden, including a half-million deaths annually, could be eliminated through policies focused on issues like land use, deforestation, water resource management, and settlement siting.
But the study didn’t cover the potential benefits of employing insecticide-treated nets as a tool for fighting malaria, ruling out a comparison of the two investments’ returns.
Worldwide, around 40% of cities’ source watersheds show high to moderate levels of degradation.
Sediment from agricultural and other sources increases the cost of water treatment, while loss of natural vegetation and land degradation can change water-flow patterns.
All of this can adversely affect supply, thereby increasing the need to store water in containers – such as drums, tanks, and concrete jars – that serve as mosquito larval habitats.
Can we show that ecological restoration of the watershed could do more than just insecticides or mosquito nets to support efforts to reduce malaria (and dengue) in cities?
In all of these cases, finding the best option requires knowing not just the relative contribution of different interventions, but understanding their complementarity.
In a world of limited resources, policymakers must prioritize their investments, including by differentiating the necessary from the desirable.
To that end, finding ways to identify and maximize complementarity is vital.
Some 2.1 billion people worldwide lack access to safe, readily available water at home, and more than twice as many – a whopping 4.5 billion – lack safely managed sanitation, severely undermining health outcomes and fueling river pollution.
With a growing share of the world’s population – including many of the same people – feeling the effects of environmental degradation and climate change firsthand, finding solutions that simultaneously advance environmental protection, water provision, and health could not be more important.
Global health and conservation professionals must cooperate more closely to find those solutions – and convince policymakers to pursue them.
Toward a Global Treaty on Plastic Waste
BERLIN – If there are any geologists in millions of years, they will easily be able to pinpoint the start of the so-called Anthropocene – the geological age during which humans became the dominant influence on our planet’s environment.
Wherever they look, they will find clear evidence of its onset, in the form of plastic waste.
Plastic is a key material in the world economy, found in cars, mobile phones, toys, clothes, packaging, medical devices, and much more.
Worldwide, 322 million metric tons of plastic were produced in 2015.
And the figure keeps growing; by 2050, it could be four times higher.
But plastic already is creating massive global environmental, economic, and social problems.
Despite requiring resources to produce, plastic is so cheap that it often is used for disposable – often single-use – products.
As a result, a huge amount of it ends up polluting the earth.
Plastic clogs cities’ sewer systems and increases the risk of flooding.
Larger pieces can fill with rainwater, providing a breeding ground for disease-spreading mosquitos.
Up to 13 million tons of plastic waste end up in the ocean each year; by 2050, there could be more plastic in there than fish.
The plastic that washes up on shores costs the tourism industry hundreds of millions of dollars every year.
Moreover, all that plastic poses a serious threat to wildlife.
Beyond the dead or dying seals, penguins, and turtles that had the bad fortune of becoming entangled in plastic rings or nets, biologists are finding dead whales and birds with stomachs stuffed with plastic debris.
Plastic products may not be all that good for humans, either.
While the plastics used, say, to package our foods are usually nontoxic, most plastics are laden with chemicals, from softeners (which can act as endocrine disruptors) to flame retardants (which can be carcinogenic or toxic in higher concentrations).
These chemicals can make it through the ocean and its food chain – and onto our plates.
Addressing the problem will not be easy; no single country or company, however determined, can do so on its own.
Many actors – including the biggest plastic producers and polluters, zero-waste initiatives, research labs, and waste-picker cooperatives – will have to tackle the problem head-on.
The first step is to create a high-level forum to facilitate discussion among such stakeholders, with the goal of developing a cooperative strategy for reducing plastic pollution.
Such a strategy should go beyond voluntary action plans and partnerships to focus on developing a legally binding international agreement, underpinned by a commitment from all governments to eliminate plastic pollution.
Negotiations on such a treaty could be launched this year, at the United Nations Environment Assembly in Nairobi in December.
Scientists have already advanced concrete proposals for a plastic-pollution treaty.
One of the authors of this article proposed a convention modeled after the Paris climate agreement: a binding overarching goal combined with voluntary national action plans and flexible measures to achieve them.
A research team from the University of Wollongong in Australia, taking inspiration from the Montreal Protocol, the treaty that safeguards the ozone layer, has suggested caps and bans on new plastic production.
Some might ask whether we should embark on yet another journey down the long, winding, and tiresome road of global treaty negotiations.
Can’t we engineer our way out of our plastic problem?
The short answer is, probably not.
Biodegradable plastics, for example, make sense only if they decompose quickly enough to avoid harming wildlife.
Even promising discoveries like bacteria or moths that can dissolve or digest plastics can provide only auxiliary support.
The only way truly to address the problem is to slash our plastic waste.
Technology might be able to help, offering more options for substitution and recycling; but, as the many zero-waste communities and cities around the world have shown, it is not necessary.
For example, Capannori, a town of 46,700 inhabitants near Lucca in Tuscany, signed a zero-waste strategy in 2007.
A decade later, it has reduced its waste by 40%.
With 82% of municipal waste now separated at source, just 18% of residual waste ends up in landfills.
Such experiences should inform and guide the national action plans that would form part of the treaty on plastics.
The European Commission’s “circular economy package” may provide another example worth emulating.
Though it has not yet been implemented, its waste targets have the potential to save the European Union 190 million tons of CO2 emissions per year.
That is the equivalent of annual emissions in the Netherlands.
Of course, the transition to zero waste will require some investment.
Any international treaty on plastic must therefore include a funding mechanism, and the “polluter pays” principle is the right place to start.
The global plastic industry, with annual revenues of about $750 billion, surely could find a few hundred million dollars to help clean up the mess it created.
A comprehensive, binding, and forward-looking global plastics treaty will not be easy to achieve.
It will take time and cost money, and it will inevitably include loopholes and have shortcomings.
It certainly will not solve the plastic pollution problem on its own.
But it is a prerequisite for success.
Plastic pollution is a defining problem of the Anthropocene.
It is, after all, a global scourge that is entirely of our making – and entirely within our power to solve as well.
Better Plastics for Healthier Oceans
LONDON – Plastics are among the most popular materials in use today.
Given the material’s versatility, it is little wonder that some 320 million tons of it are used around the world each year.
Indeed, the recent holidays left many with a mountain of plastic products and packaging.
But plastics also pose a serious environmental threat.
If not disposed of properly, plastics can lie or float around for decades.
In addition to being harmful to terrestrial and aquatic life, free-floating plastics in oceans can adsorb toxins and break up into micro-plastics, which then enter the food chain.
It is this seeming immortality that has led governments to tax certain environmentally damaging plastic products or ban them altogether.
Many governments are also encouraging better waste management, and the reuse, redesign, and recycling of plastic products.
This is prudent policymaking.
But while taxes, bans, and waste-management policies will reduce the problem of plastic pollution, they will not solve it.
And, because plastics are made from a byproduct of oil refining, a ban would have little or no impact on hydrocarbon extraction, either.
What taxes and bans will do is deprive the poorest people of a useful and inexpensive material.
The fact is that, despite the best efforts of well-intentioned lawmakers and nongovernmental organizations, thousands of tons of plastic waste are still entering the environment, particularly the oceans, every day.
Clearly, a better approach is needed.
Some governments and companies have been persuaded that “bio-plastics” – which are derived partly from biomass like cornstarch – are the solution.
But this argument is flawed: bio-plastics are very expensive and energy-intensive to produce, and still contain large amounts of material derived from oil.
Moreover, recycling bio-plastics requires that they be separated from ordinary plastic.
Such polymers are tested to biodegrade, but only in the particular conditions found in industrial composting.
In other words, while this technology might sound appealing, it will not solve the problem of plastic litter seeping into the environment.
The focus of the plastics industry has long been on a product’s functionality during its lifespan.
This approach is no longer tenable.
The world needs a new type of plastic – one that will perform well, but will also biodegrade much faster than the plastics we use today.
Enter oxo-biodegradable plastic.
Unlike other plastics, including bio-plastics, OBP biodegrades anywhere in the environment, and can be recycled if collected during its useful life.
Ordinary plastic products can be upgraded to OBP with existing machinery at the time of manufacture and at little to no extra cost, using technology that the Oxo-biodegradable Plastics Association is working to explain.
OBP is produced when a special additive is mixed with a normal polymer.
The additive (produced by a company where I am a director) dismantles the molecular structure of the polymer at the end of its useful life and enables natural decomposition in an open environment.
And, when it comes to OBP, decomposition doesn’t mean breakdown into plastic fragments.
As Ignacy Jakubowicz, a professor at the Research Institutes of Sweden and one of the world’s leading experts on polymers, explains, when OBPs break down, the material changes entirely, with hydrocarbon molecules becoming oxygen-containing molecules that can be assimilated back into the environment.
According to international standards (such as ASTM D6954), the use of OBP would demand proof of degradation and biodegradation, and confirmation that there are no heavy metals or eco-toxicity.
As plastics change, the ways countries integrate them into their economies must change, too.
The good news is that, though the United States and Europe have been slow to embrace innovative solutions, others have been more open to them.
For example, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have banned the import or manufacture of conventional plastics for a wide range of products, and both now require that plastic products be upgraded with OBP technology.
They have not opted for “bio-based” plastics.
The world does not need new bans or taxes.
Rather, it needs people who work with plastic, and their governments, to become as adaptable as the material itself, taking advantage of technological advances to ensure that we can make the most of a cheap and versatile material, without subjecting the environment to its damaging impact.
The Platform Economy
WASHINGTON, DC – Hardly a day goes by without another article, conference, or research initiative devoted to the future of work.
The robots are coming, or they’re not coming as fast as we think; when they do come, they’ll put everyone out of work, or they’ll create as many jobs as they destroy.
Thus the conversation goes.
But what if, instead of trying to predict the future, we look at realities that exist today for billions of people?
Some 80% of the global population lives in emerging economies – defined by informal markets and fluid employment structures.
The SHIFT: Commission on Work, Workers, and Technology invited groups in five cities across the United States to imagine four scenarios along two axes of change – more or less work, and more jobs or more tasks.
Participants were divided as to the amount of future work, but almost all foresaw the continuing disaggregation of jobs into tasks in both low- and high-end work, from driving to lawyering.
That is the reality in emerging economies today.
Examining work patterns in these diverse countries yields three key lessons.
First, people layer multiple work streams and derive income from more than one source.
Second, platform economies are emerging rapidly and build on traditional networks.
Finally, these work patterns often go hand in hand with dramatic income inequality.
Flexibility and uncertainty define informal markets in developing countries.
Those lucky men and women who have formal jobs (less than 40%) often have “side hustles” through which they sell their time, expertise, network, or ideas to others in an effort to hedge against an uncertain labor market.
A Nigerian saying – “you have a 9 to 5, a 5 to 9 and a weekend job” – aptly describes the environment of layered work.
The same pattern is starting to emerge in developed countries.
A report by the JPMorgan-Chase Institute concludes that platform jobs are largely a secondary source of income, used to offset dips in regular income.
A key difference, however, is that in emerging economies flexible networks of individuals or small businesses take the place of formal employers.
Kenya’s informal sector – called in Kiswahili the Jua Kali (“hot sun”) – is the country’s main job creator.
The 2017 Economic Survey in Kenya showed that the Jua Kali generated 747,300 jobs the previous year, whereas the formal sector added only 85,600.
The Jua Kali comprises sector-based associations among workers and artisans that harken back to medieval guilds.
The associations – of carpenters, mechanics, plumbers, and so on – enable pooled savings, provide opportunities to upgrade skills, and create a form of market regulation.
As technology has been added, many of the associations are going online to match supply and demand in the informal labor market more effectively.
Go-Jek in Indonesia (named as a pun on ojek, a motorcycle taxi) is a $2.5 billion company that delivers everything from food to hairdressers by motorbike through an app.
The company, with more than 200,000 drivers on the platform, boosts Indonesians’ productivity in the face of snarling traffic.
The market for low-cost legal services in Accra, Ghana, provides another interesting example.
Journalist Joseph Warungu describes a “narrow alleyway at the back of the court buildings” teeming with notaries, commissioners for oaths, letter writers, and lawyers offering services from witness statements to contracts, all “processed efficiently and at a pocket-friendly rate.”
That alleyway is a platform, bringing together multiple sellers of separate legal services together with buyers, in contrast to a traditional law firm, which requires clients to purchase multiple services from the same source.
It simply needs to migrate online.
Developed economies are only beginning to catch up.
Bliss Lawyers has “a bench” of more than 15,000 lawyers across the US who are paid over $200 an hour for “work on an engagement basis for in-house legal department and law firm clients.”
More broadly, the Business Talent Group provides “in-demand business talent on-demand,” across a wide range of professional services.
Emerging markets also offer a cautionary tale concerning the downside of the on-demand economy.
They have some of the highest levels of inequality in the world.
The world’s 50 most unequal economies are in Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America, with South Africa taking the prize for the highest income inequality.
Informal markets, lack of access to finance, and poor educational opportunities in these countries continue to trap most people in relative poverty.
Gig economy platforms that provide small jobs without benefits or career progression can supplement income and buffer other employment, but they do not add up to the security and advancement opportunities of a formal job.
Indeed, most emerging-market workers turn to the gig economy not out of a desire for flexibility or to follow their passions, but simply to make ends meet.
Nonetheless, informal markets in developing countries provide a vast field for experimentation to transform a patchwork of jobs into a steady upward path for workers.
Tailoring education to allow workers to get the on-demand skills they need when they need them, and creating verifiable work histories through blockchain, are two ways to help gig economy workers find suitable opportunities more efficiently and capture more value from selling their labor.
While developed countries in Europe, North America, and Asia are rapidly aging, emerging economies are predominantly youthful.
By 2040, one in four workers worldwide will be African.
They are products of dynamic informal markets, and that should ease their absorption into a tech-enabled gig economy.
Nigerian, Indonesian, and Vietnamese young people will shape global work trends at an increasingly rapid pace.
We can learn from them today to prepare for tomorrow.
Stopping the Child Killers
SEATTLE – In far too many places around the world, the biggest child killers are caused by the smallest of organisms – the viruses, bacteria, and single cell parasites that cause diarrhea and pneumonia.
Given the monumental advances that have been made in public health – both diseases are preventable and curable – this is inexcusable.
It is imperative that all children, especially those most at risk, have access to life-saving health-care services.
According to UNICEF, pneumonia and diarrhea kill a full one-quarter of the 5.9 million children under the age of five who die each year.
And a new report from the International Vaccine Access Center shows that nearly three-quarters of pneumonia and diarrhea deaths occur in just 15 countries.
In these countries and elsewhere, such deaths are most prevalent within the poorest and most marginalized communities.
While the figures do reflect progress in recent decades, the tragedy is that the improvement could have been much larger, had governments not consistently succumbed to the temptation to focus on only one or two interventions at a time.
To end child deaths from these diseases once and for all, governments must commit to scaling up simultaneously the full suite of interventions identified by the World Health Organization and UNICEF two years ago, in their integrated Global Action Plan for Pneumonia and Diarrhea.
One critical – and extraordinarily cost-effective – intervention is the promotion of exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of life, a practice that helps supports the development of a baby’s immune system.
As it stands, in 12 of the 15 countries suffering the most child deaths from pneumonia and diarrhea, exclusive breastfeeding rates fall short of the WHO’s 50% global target.
Furthermore, governments must ensure that all children have access to life-saving vaccines.
Though a vaccine for pneumococcal infection – a leading cause of pneumonia – was developed at the turn of the century, it is not included in routine immunization programs in five of the countries where pneumonia is most pervasive (Chad, China, India, Indonesia, and Somalia).
This must change.
As for diarrhea, a comprehensive global study found that moderate to severe cases are caused primarily by rotavirus, making that virus the leading killer of infants and toddlers worldwide.
But, though rotavirus vaccines have been rolled out in 79 countries – a significant accomplishment – a staggering 74% of the world’s infants remain unlikely to be inoculated this year.
The vaccine’s introduction for Indian infants next year will be a major milestone.
But other Asian countries, such as Bangladesh and Pakistan, have not yet decided whether to do the same.
When children contract diarrhea, they need access to the right treatments.
Oral rehydration salts and zinc supplements not only drastically reduce mortality rates; they are also inexpensive to scale up.
In treating pneumonia, access to antibiotics is essential.
The common denominator among these interventions is the need for sufficient well-trained health workers serving impoverished communities.
Indeed, health workers are needed to guide mothers as they attempt to breastfeed – which is not always as easy as it sounds – and reinforce the importance of the practice.
They are needed to deliver vaccines and treatments. And they are needed to dispense advice to families on how to protect their children from death by pneumonia, diarrhea, and other diseases, including through information about when to seek care if they do.
Governments have a pivotal role to play in ensuring that the poorest and most marginalized communities have access to critical health services, by providing the right training, tools, supervision, funding, and logistical support for health workers.
This – together with other critical interventions, such as the provision of clean water and effective sanitation facilities – will require a strong and sustained political commitment, one that civil society and the media, by keeping their governments accountable, can help to secure.
There are still far too many children around the world who do not have access to the essential health services they need to survive and thrive.
Accelerating the discussion of proven, low-cost methods to prevent, treat, and cure pneumonia and diarrhea is critical to give all children the chance they deserve.
Where you live should not determine whether you live.
Russiagate in Poland
WARSAW – While many Americans remain transfixed by investigations into Russian meddling in the 2016 US presidential election, Poles are learning that their country may have served as a testing ground for Russia’s efforts.
Russia has long sought to install pro-Kremlin politicians at the highest levels of power in Central and Eastern Europe.
And there is now evidence suggesting that Russian military intelligence agencies are wielding influence in Poland’s Ministry of Defense.
In 2014, when Poland was governed by Civic Platform (PO), it was the only country in Europe that had successfully staved off recession in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis.
During the PO government’s eight years in power, Poland’s GDP grew by almost 25%, while unemployment and the budget deficit fell by almost half.
Despite this strong performance, Jarosław Kaczyński’s Law and Justice (PiS) party resoundingly defeated PO in Poland’s 2015 parliamentary elections.
To understand why, we need to go back to 2013, when Marek Falenta, a shady Polish businessman, hired two waiters to record private conversations in a restaurant frequented by politicians.
These secret recordings fueled a scandal that forced almost all of the PO’s leadership out of government.
Among those who resigned was Marshal of the Sejm Radek Sikorski, the co-author of a European Union initiative designed to strengthen the resilience of certain Eastern European and Eurasian countries to Russian pressure.
PiS politicians also frequented venues where recordings were made, and yet none of their conversations were leaked.
Falenta, it turned out, had owed $26 million to a Russian firm, Kuzbasskaya Toplivnaya Kompaniya, with close ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin.
And while he was eventually convicted for his involvement in the eavesdropping plot, no one else involved in orchestrating the leaks has been identified.
At the same time, similar scandals removed liberal politicians from power in Hungary and Slovakia, which are now ruled by the most pro-Russian governments in the EU.
When the PiS assumed power in 2015, Poland’s foreign and defense policies took a bizarre turn, starting with the appointment of Antoni Macierewicz as Minister of Defense.
Macierewicz, the only PiS politician who acts independently – and sometimes in defiance – of Kaczyński, was also the man behind Poland’s botched 1992 lustration, or political screening, process, which delayed the country’s de-communization efforts.
Many still remember the notorious “Macierewicz List” from that period, which tarred innocent people as communist-era secret-police collaborators.
Under a later government, Macierewicz published a report on Poland’s counterintelligence agency, the Military Information Services, which outed undercover Polish intelligence agents and led to the disbanding of the agency.
While in power, the PiS has started disputes with Poland’s most important European allies: Germany, France, and the European Commission.
In November 2015, it ordered a raid on a NATO-affiliated counterintelligence center that had been established to track Russian intelligence efforts.
Then, Macierewicz’s defense ministry unexpectedly canceled a contract with France for the purchase of 50 Caracal helicopters, leaving Poland without a crucial military capacity to this day.
And earlier this year, Macierewicz fired 90% of the military’s General Staff and 82% of its General Command, and formed a new military force whose leadership consists of pro-Kremlin activists and NATO critics.
Recently, the Polish journalists Tomasz Piątek of Gazeta Wyborcza and Radosław Gruca of Fakt, along with the organization Miasto Jest Nasze (the City Is Ours), have uncovered highly suspicious associations from Macierewicz’s past.
For example, one of Macierewicz’s closest business and political associates after 1989 was Robert Lusnia, later found to have served as an informant both during and after the communist period, his recent handlers most likely being agents of Russia’s Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU) operating in Poland.
Piątek has also delineated “numerous and long-term connections between Macierewicz and Russian gangster and financier Semion Mogilevich and the Russian GRU.”
According to the American investigative journalist Robert I. Friedman, Mogilevich is “the most dangerous mobster in the world,” and is widely known to work closely with the GRU.
Macierewicz’s closest ally in the United States is the US senator-cum-lobbyist Alfonse D’Amato, who supported Trump during the 2016 campaign.
D’Amato’s assistant, Edmund Janniger, served as an adviser to Macierewicz until 2015.
The American press has reported that both D’Amato and Mogilevich have past ties to The Bank of New York Mellon, which extended loans to D’Amato’s Senate campaign in the early 1980s, and allegedly laundered money for Russian organized crime groups in the 1990s.
Today, D’Amato’s firm, Park Strategies, lobbies for the interests of US arms manufacturers Aerojet Rocketdyne and United Technologies at the Kremlin, and it has recently provided services for Poland’s Ministry of Defense under Macierewicz.
Indeed, Macierewicz hired Park Strategies to help with the 2016 NATO summit in Warsaw – a major event for arms makers.
And before Macierewicz canceled the arms contract with France, he met with D’Amato, a lobbyist also for the US arms manufacturer Lockheed Martin.
Afterwards, Macierewicz began calling for the purchase of Lockheed’s Black Hawk helicopters.
In response to these many revelations, Macierewicz decided not to file a civil suit against Piątek, which would have required him to prove the journalist’s findings incorrect.
Instead, he has called for Piątek to be criminally prosecuted for threatening a government official.
But Macierewicz is not the only PiS official under a Russian cloud.
The Guardian recently reported that, “Bartosz Kownacki, a key lieutenant of defense minister Antoni Macierewicz, was a member of a group of Polish international observers during Russia’s 2012 election.”
Kownacki was accompanied on that trip, according to the report, by “Mateusz Piskorski, the founder of a Polish think tank, the European Centre for Geopolitical Analysis (ECGA) who is now in detention in Poland, facing charges of spying for Moscow.”
It is in Putin’s interest to sow discord in the West, especially within the EU, and no one is furthering his aim of EU disintegration more effectively than the current Polish government.
Given its strong economy, Poland could be a powerful ally to France and Germany in a post-Brexit Europe that is working toward deeper integration.
But France and Germany cannot count on Poland so long as Kaczyński and Macierewicz are in charge, behaving toward the EU in ways that benefit only Russia.
Why Polish Judicial Independence Matters
BUDAPEST – After some delay, Poland’s government, controlled by the Law and Justice (PiS) party, has finally responded to concerns raised by the European Commission about its legislative attack on judicial independence.
But, according to Frans Timmermans, the Commission’s first vice president, Poland is still refusing to cooperate, and has not announced “any concrete measures to address the issues raised.”
It remains to be seen if the European Union will use the political and economic tools at its disposal to sanction the Polish government.
We believe it should – resolutely and swiftly.
The PiS’s efforts to bring Poland’s courts under political control violate the EU’s fundamental democratic values and threaten its governance of the single market.
At this point, continued inaction on the EU’s part could threaten the project of economic integration altogether.
Market integration among economies at different levels of development relies primarily on regulatory standardization.
The single market works because an entrepreneur in the Netherlands and an entrepreneur in Poland can both expect to be governed by the same rules, regardless of whether they are selling goods or investing in Italy, Hungary, France, or Bulgaria.
These agreed rules are enforced not just by EU courts and bureaucracies, but also by national courts in the member states.
The EU’s framework for enforcing common rules, however, does not automatically confer the same benefits to each member state.
When market integration was pursued in earnest in the 1980s, it was agreed that member states with less developed economies would be entitled to transfers until they had caught up with the bloc’s average level of development.
Today, such transfers represent about a third of the EU budget, and 2-5% of GDP in the recipient economies.
This arrangement was meant to reduce disparities among EU members to the point that transfers would no longer be needed.
But it always had a crucial weakness: the EU has only limited authority to control the domestic institutions in charge of ensuring that recipient countries spend the funds appropriately.
And a country’s judiciary is chief among those institutions.
We have researched how evolving state capacities affect economic development in 17 Central and Eastern European countries, and we found that autonomous judiciaries are of central importance.
Capable, independent courts are the prime movers behind the development of a professional state bureaucracy.
Without judicial oversight, there is no guarantee that supervisory agencies will monitor and enforce the rules of market competition effectively and impartially.
We have also found that increased judicial autonomy boosts economic development in countries even before they have joined the EU.
When a country’s courts become more reliable and predictable, its exports tend to increase and become more technologically complex soon thereafter.
By the same token, judiciaries can hinder economic development if they are not independent or reliable.
When domestic firms cannot count on courts to issue fair and consistent rulings, they will conclude that success depends less on entrepreneurship than on cronyism or loyalty to market incumbents.
Accordingly, they will invest less, and shy away from innovation.
Hungary’s recent experience demonstrates that if incumbents do not fear judicial oversight, they will engage in predatory behavior toward weaker market participants, thereby capturing larger segments of the economy.
This ultimately results in declining public revenue, which forces the government to look for other ways to finance basic public goods.
To keep the economy afloat and remain in power, the government will become all the more reliant on EU transfers.
The Polish and Hungarian governments have turned the worst nightmare of the single market’s founding fathers into a reality.
In both countries, the institutions that could help domestic actors to benefit from market integration are being undermined – to say nothing of citizens’ rights and opportunities – even as the illiberal regimes causing this erosion continue to receive EU funds.
This state of affairs has exposed the limits of EU-level control over how the bloc’s money is spent within member states; and it shows that the development of domestic institutions can be reversed all too easily.
When the single market was created, many assumed that it would provide ample incentives for domestic firms and policymakers to develop sound national-level institutions, in order to capitalize on lucrative new opportunities.
But that assumption’s flaws have now been laid bare.
The tragedy in Greece after the financial crisis a decade ago showed that incumbents will not necessarily take it upon themselves to develop strong institutions.
And in Poland and Hungary today, we are learning that illiberal governments will even go so far as to weaken their own country’s institutions for political gain.
The time has come for the EU to take bold action before other member-state governments try the same trick.
New Puppet, Same Puppet Master in Poland
WARSAW – Whether Poland’s parliament, the Sejm, would manage to hold a vote on Mateusz Morawiecki’s nomination as prime minister remained unclear until the last minute.
December 13 was fast approaching, and the ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party wanted to avoid holding the vote on that date at all costs.
For Poles, December 13 is associated with the communist government’s declaration of martial law in 1981.
On that night 36 years ago, Jarosław Kaczyński, the PiS’s chairman and today the de facto leader of Poland, was sleeping soundly while communism’s true opponents were arrested by the thousands.
Stanisław Piotrowicz, the state prosecutor under martial law (which remained in effect until 1983), is currently leading the PiS government’s campaign to seize control of the Polish judiciary.
Morawiecki has now been sworn in as prime minister, succeeding Beata Szydło, under whose premiership the PiS enjoyed higher favorability – reaching 47% in October – than at any other time in its history.
According to the most popular theory, the only reason for replacing her is PiS’s desire to mollify the European Union (which is poised to impose unprecedented sanctions on a Union member because of Poland’s failure to uphold EU norms) and attract investors.
Investment as a share of GDP fell significantly in 2016, to just above 18%, and has continued to fall through 2017, amounting to the worst performance in 21 years.
While serving as deputy prime minister in Szydło’s cabinet, Morawiecki, a former bank executive, announced a plan to attract investment in new technologies, which Poland needs to sustain economic convergence with its wealthier EU neighbors.
But Poland owes what limited economic growth it has experienced under the PiS government not to Morawiecki, but to Elżbieta Rafalska, the minister of labor and social policy, who has been propping up consumption with social measures such as a monthly child credit of 500 złoty ($140).
So, what is the real reason for Szydło’s ouster?
Simply put, during her tenure, the government took the Polish ship of state for such a ride that the keel eventually had to be replaced.
Her party has co-opted every institution and instrument of power that it can, with little thought about the consequences.
But now it will have a harder time broadening its hold on power.
Taking over or suppressing the private media, for example, would bring the party into conflict not just with the opposition, but also with entrenched business interests, which carry much more clout abroad than Poland’s beleaguered courts do.
Morawiecki confronted this reality the day after his nomination, when a draconian government fine against the independent TVN24 television network, a subsidiary of the American media company Scripps Networks Interactive, drew sharp rebukes from both the US Department of State and the EU.
In his first interview as prime minister, Morawiecki told the far-right broadcaster Radio Maryja that he plans to “re-Christianize Europe.”
Does that sound like someone seeking reconciliation with the EU?
Morawiecki is not exactly known for his tact or foresight.
When TVN24’s Monika Olejnik asked him to choose between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, he replied that it would be like choosing between plague and cholera.
Needless to say, Morawiecki’s first meeting with the US president will be interesting to watch.
The fact is that the Polish government’s overhaul has been in the works for some time.
But in the original plan, Kaczyński himself was supposed to step in as prime minister.
But he had second thoughts, fearing that the move would jeopardize the PiS’s chances in the 2019 parliamentary elections.
Kaczyński wants an overwhelming victory, and he knows that he, along with Antoni Macierewicz, the defense minister, is one of Poland’s least popular or trusted politicians.
Szydło and Morawiecki are viewed more favorably.
Kaczyński is, moreover, already prone to public outbursts, and he would have been expected to speak publicly – and even to answer occasional questions from journalists – were he to have assumed the premiership.
With Szydło, government officials were not too afraid to tell the boss unpleasant truths.
But with Kaczyński formally in charge, the government would quickly end up entangled in its own lies – deceiving itself and the public at the same time.
With Morawiecki as prime minister, Kaczyński can continue to use his current non-governmental role to control the government without having to take responsibility for its policies or actions.
In this, Kaczyński is emulating his idol, the interwar leader Józef Piłsudski (though the “First Marshal of Poland” did go on to serve as prime minister twice).
Given these political considerations, Morawiecki is good prime minister material for the same reason that Szydło was: he is a nobody in the party.
And now that he has Kaczyński’s support, he is deeply resented by other leading PiS figures such as Macierewicz and justice minister Zbigniew Ziobro, who has just assumed direct control of the courts.
This makes Morawiecki a reliable puppet.
And he is meant to serve a specific purpose.
After shoring up its position on the Polish right, PiS wants to broaden its appeal to the center in preparation for the next election.
Morawiecki job is to impede the opposition and counteract President Andrzej Duda, who has acted independently, such as by vetoing part of the government’s judicial power grab.
(Duda gave up eventually, but Kaczyński had already lost confidence in him.)
Morawiecki will seduce neither the EU nor the business community.
But he will make it easier for middle-class voters to identify with PiS.
In the first opinion poll conducted after his nomination, the party achieved a 50% favorability rating – a new record.
As always, Kaczyński’s top concern is to consolidate his own power.
He has never been interested in the European project, and he has demonstrated over the past two years that he has no use for the EU.
Sooner or later, the EU will demonstrate that it has no use for him, either, and Poland’s people will lose out once again.
Mourning Poland’s Anti-Populist Martyr
WARSAW – Late in the afternoon on October 19, a 54-year-old man outside the Palace of Culture and Science in Warsaw distributed several dozen copies of a letter addressed to the Polish people.
Then he set himself on fire - a protest and sacrifice that called to mind the protests of Buddhist monks against the Vietnam War a half-century ago, and that of the Czech student Jan Palach against the Soviet crushing of the Prague Spring in 1969.
The text of the letter that was left behind is eminently rational. It carefully enumerates and decries actions taken by Poland’s government that, according to Polish and international courts alike, amount to an attack on the rule of law and liberal democracy.
The letter accuses the government, controlled by the Law and Justice (PiS) party, of restricting civil liberties and undermining the judiciary.
Specifically, it condemns the PiS for its discrimination against immigrants, women, LGBT people, Muslims, and others, and for destroying the environment, by supporting coal-based energy, hunting, and logging in Białowieża Forest.
More broadly, the letter also denounces “the people holding the country’s highest offices” for abdicating government decision-making to PiS Chairman Jarosław Kaczyński, who holds no public office; and for converting public television and radio stations into PiS “propaganda organs.”
And it laments that the PiS government has made Poland an “object of ridicule” on the world stage.
One of the man’s goals in immolating himself, according to the letter, was to force “the chairman of PiS and the entire PiS nomenklatura to recognize that my death is their direct responsibility, and that they have my blood on their hands.”
The man hoped that his act of protest would influence PiS supporters – 47% of the population, according to the latest polls – who should not want their favored policies to be enacted in ways that undermine democracy and the rule of law.
But the letter also implores the party’s opponents – 16% of Poles support the largest opposition party – “to remember that PiS voters are our mothers, brothers, neighbors, friends, and colleagues.”
As such, they should not be vilified, but rather reminded of “the rules of democracy.”
The letter concludes by calling on all Poles to “wake up” and change their government before it causes irreparable damage to the country.
So far, all we know about the letter writer is that his first name is Piotr, and that he is currently in critical condition, with burns covering 60% of his body.
But, despite his anonymity, his ideas are resonating through Poland.
In a separate letter to the media, Piotr warned that the PiS would attempt to minimize his act of protest.
“Their first point of attack,” he predicted, would be to point out that he suffers from depression.
“I am what you could call a mentally ill person,” he wrote.
“But there are millions like me in Poland, and somehow they manage to function more or less normally.”
Piotr’s plea is clear: please do not confuse depression with insanity.
In Poland, the reactions to Piotr’s self-immolation have been mixed.
At first, the media were rather silent, with the exception of a few opposition pundits who spoke out to hold the PiS responsible.
In response to this criticism, Interior Minister Mariusz Błaszczak, tried, as predicted, to attribute Piotr’s action to his depression.
Błaszczak then described Piotr as “a victim of the opposition’s all-out propaganda, which proclaims that they are fighting the government in the streets and abroad.”
Meanwhile, the renowned Polish filmmaker Agnieszka Holland issued a strong rebuke against liberal media outlets that would attribute Piotr’s protest to mental illness.
It is an “act of extreme moral laziness,” she wrote on Oko.press, to explain “such extreme civic despair and self-sacrifice as a result of depression, mental illness, and a related desire to end one’s own life.”
Holland speaks from a position of authority on this topic.
She is the daughter of Henryk Holland, an anti-Communist dissident who committed suicide in 1961.
And in 2013, she made an HBO miniseries about Palach’s self-immolation in Wenceslas Square.
For my part, I believe the Polish people should heed the message that Piotr conveyed in his letter.
Even if his actions did stem from some personal crisis, they should not be written off as the behavior of an irrational person.
After all, we can’t possibly know more than the man himself about his intentions.
He deserves to have his stated motives and opinions known, discussed, and taken seriously.
But Piotr’s act should not be made a spectacle in Poland’s political fight, or wielded haphazardly as a blunt object against the PiS or anyone else.
As the World Health Organization states in its guidelines for journalists covering suicides, “Suicide should not be reported as unexplainable or in a simplistic way.”
Moreover, suicide victims should not be glorified as “martyrs and objects of public adulation,” lest other “susceptible persons” come to think “that their society honors suicidal behavior.”
After an act of despair such as what Poland witnessed this month, the first priority should be to mourn the victim.
The second should be to channel the despair that many are feeling in ways that nurture hope.
Economic Growth Is No Longer Enough
MADRID – Macroeconomic data from the world’s advanced economies can be mystifying when viewed in isolation.
But when analyzed collectively, the data reveal a troubling truth: without changes to how wealth is generated and distributed, the political convulsions that have swept the world in recent years will only intensify.
Consider, for example, wages and employment.
In the United States and many European countries, average salaries have stagnated, despite most economies having recovered from the 2008 financial crisis in terms of GDP and job growth.
Moreover, increases in employment have not led to a slowdown or a reversal of the decline in the wage share of total national income.
On the contrary, most of the wealth created since the 2008 crisis has gone to the rich.
This might explain the low levels of consumption that characterize most advanced economies, and the failure of extremely lax monetary policy to produce an uptick in inflation.
Employment, too, seems to be performing in anomalous ways.
Job creation, where it has taken place, has followed a different path than history suggests it should.
For example, most employment growth has been in high-skill or low-skill occupations, hollowing out the middle.
Many of the people who once comprised the Western middle class are now part of the middle-lower and lower classes, and live more economically precarious lives than ever before.
Productivity growth has also become polarized.
According to the OECD, in the last decade, productivity within “frontier firms” – defined as the top 5% of firms in terms of productivity growth – increased by more than a third, whereas the rest of the private sector experienced almost no productivity growth at all.
In other words, a smaller number of companies have made greater efficiency gains, but there has been relatively no diffusion of these benefits into the broader economy.
It is unclear why these trends are occurring, although the impact of new technologies and related network effects is certainly part of the reason.
At the macro level, aggregate US productivity has increased by more than 250% since the early 1970s, while hourly wages have remained stagnant.
This means that productivity growth has not only been concentrated within a narrow set of firms, but also that productivity and market labor income have decoupled.
The fundamental consequence of this is that wages are no longer performing the central redistributive role they have played for decades.
Simply put, gains in capital productivity are not being translated into higher median incomes, a breach of the social contract on which liberal economies rest.
It should be evident by now that many of the world’s economies are undergoing some form of structural change, and in the wake of that change, the “jobs-productivity-income” distribution triangle has gone askew.
This paradigm shift has led to the erosion of the Western middle class and the rise of the precariat, a new socioeconomic class comprising not just those who cannot find a job, but also those who are informally, casually, or otherwise insecurely employed.
We now have abundant evidence linking the perception of economic insecurity in the West with anti-elite sentiment, political radicalization, and attacks on minorities.
It is impossible to explain the recent rise of populist politics without considering the effects of these economic pathologies on average workers in the US and Europe.
To understand why the deviations from expected economic trajectories have occurred, one need look no further than the impact of technology on jobs.
Advanced technologies, particularly advanced computing and robotics, have enabled productivity gains to occur without a corresponding increase in wages.
The greater wealth generated by higher productivity goes instead to the owners of these technologies.
Automation of fairly sophisticated routine jobs is driving the polarization of the labor market.
What remains are either hard-to-automate tasks that require little or no skill, or hard-to-automate tasks that require very high skills.
The latter jobs are much smaller in number than the former, and they happen to be in frontier firms that are leveraging the effects of technology to outperform direct competitors, and to expand into new markets.
This brings us to the central question of our era: How can leaders address the externalities produced by rapid technological change, and thereby ensure economic and political sustainability?
Put another way, how can we construct a new social contract for the digital age?
Remedies are harder to come by than diagnoses.
It is unclear, for example, if applying old economic treatments would reverse current trends.
Pushing “structural reforms” and designing narrow macroeconomic policies aimed exclusively at increasing productivity might force Western workers to compete with technology to an even greater extent, exacerbating precariousness.
Perhaps our current economic arrangements can produce growth only at the aggregate level, while driving down most people’s living standards.
The debate about solutions has only just begun.
Reducing economic inequality will require reforms of education and taxation, with the tax burden shifting decisively from labor to capital.
Western countries will also need to create new redistributive mechanisms to supplement the declining role of wages in their economies.
The data make an overwhelming case for such reforms.
If Western leaders are to contain, and ultimately quell, the political convulsions that their countries are now experiencing, they have no choice but to respond by crafting new, inclusive growth models.
Can Movement Politics Renew European Democracy?
PRINCETON – Many people expected the big political story of 2017 to be about the triumph of populism in Europe.
But things didn’t turn out that way.
Instead, the biggest story was about self-styled “movements” upending or replacing traditional political parties.
Consider French President Emmanuel Macron’s La République En Marche!, which swept the French presidential and parliamentary elections this past spring.
Or consider how, at the end of the year, 31-year-old Sebastian Kurz became Chancellor of Austria after refashioning the conservative Austrian People’s Party (ÖVP) into a movement called “The Sebastian Kurz list – The New People’s Party.”
Across the European continent, more voters have come to see traditional political parties as self-interested and power-hungry.
In the developing world, too, parties with well-established pedigrees, such as the African National Congress (ANC) in South Africa, are now widely regarded as corrupt.
In many cases, traditional parties have become what political scientists call “cartels”: they use state resources to remain in power, and, regardless of their policy differences, they often work together to keep out challengers.
Young voters, in particular, seem to have less interest in working for traditional parties, which they view as overly bureaucratic, and thus boring.
One is reminded of Oscar Wilde’s famous quip about the problem with socialism: it takes up too many evenings.
Not surprisingly, then, the most innovative political experiments in Europe in recent years have emerged from street protests and mass assemblies that eschewed hierarchical forms of organization.
For example, Spain’s left-wing Podemos was formed after mass demonstrations by the indignados in 2011.
Italy’s populist Five Star Movement (M5S), which came out on top in Italy’s 2013 parliamentary elections and is predicted to do well again in 2018, emerged from large rallies organized by comedian Beppe Grillo against “la casta” – his derogatory term for what he sees as the country’s ruling casteof professional politicians and journalists.
Yet something funny happened between these movements’ origins as spontaneous, inclusive street protests and their later success at the ballot box.
Ironically, even as they have continued to tout horizontal forms of organization and participatory democracy, their charismatic leaders have concentrated ever more power in their own hands.
Podemos Secretary-General Pablo Iglesias, for instance, has drawn criticism from idealistic activists in the movement for his “hyper-leadership” and “online Leninism.”
In response, Iglesias has declared that, “one cannot storm heaven by consensus.”
Grillo holds no official position in M5S, which bills itself as a “non-association,” and yet he owns the blog that has been key to the movement’s success, as well as the copyright to its official symbol.
He has revoked M5S members’ right to use that symbol for supposedly breaking the “rules” – or what is officially called the “non-statute” – of his “anti-party.”
And those running for public office under the M5S banner must sign a contract promising to pay fines if they violate party principles.
Of course, political movements are not necessarily populist in nature.
As the Green and feminist movements have shown, a movement can contest traditional forms of politics without claiming to represent “the real people” or the “silent majority.”
But today’s political movements also tend to be less pluralistic than the large parties that have dominated post-war European politics.
This makes sense, given that “movement” implies not just dynamism, but also a presumption that all members are in complete agreement about the path forward.
The problem is that when everyone supposedly already agrees on where they are going, there seems to be no need for extensive democratic deliberation.
Thus, the movements that have emerged in Europe in recent years – on both the left and the right – have focused on strengthening their respective individual leaders, rather than empowering their rank-and-file members, even when they emphasize participatory democracy.
In the case of Macron and Kurz, each leader has tapped into the sense of dynamism and purpose that is usually a key feature of single-issue movement politics.
Kurz, for his part, has bent the entire ÖVP to his will.
In addition to giving it a new name, he has reorganized its internal structures and changed its official color from black to turquoise.
Still, the party’s conservative platform has hardly changed at all, suggesting that Kurz’s moves are about marketing and asserting his personal authority more than anything else.
In the end, Podemos, La République En Marche!, and Momentum, the youth movement that helped Jeremy Corbyn reshape the British Labour Party’s platform, are not important because they are movements per se.
Rather, they are important because they provide more political choices for citizens, especially those frustrated with prevailing duopolies – political systems dominated by two long-established parties offering nearly identical policy prescriptions.
In Corbyn’s case, movement politics could reestablish Labour’s progressive credentials, and reverse what many saw as an embrace of neoliberal policies under former Prime Minister Tony Blair.
But it would be naive to think that movements alone will make European politics more democratic.
If anything, they could operate even less democratically than traditional parties, owing to their strong plebiscitary forms of leadership.
Democracy Beyond the Nation-State
WASHINGTON, DC – According to the Harvard economist Dani Rodrik, it is impossible to have full national sovereignty, democracy, and globalization simultaneously.
The concept of a “political trilemma of the world economy,” which Javier Solana also recently explored, is useful, but incomplete.
Rodrik’s argument, elaborated in his new book, is that too much globalization erodes the sovereignty of democratic nation-states, by increasingly subjecting them to economic and financial forces that may not correspond with the wishes of the domestic majority.
By this logic, an authoritarian state may function better in a globalized world, because it is unconstrained by, say, electoral concerns.
With less globalization, democratic decision-making within the nation-state would be less constrained by external forces – particularly financial markets – meaning that its scope would be wider.
Globalization and democracy, without the nation-state, is also possible, though Rodrik is skeptical about whether democratic institutions could function on a global scale.
Of course, Rodrik does not portray this trilemma as a hard-and-fast rule.
Rather, his goal is to highlight the challenges associated with fostering or maintaining these three institutional arrangements, partly or fully.
But, to get the most out of Rodrik’s concept, it is necessary to account for another dimension: the many levels of governance that exist in today’s world.
The nation-state, managed by national government, remains the fundamental building block of the international order.
But below the nation-state are states (or provinces), cities, and regions, which may have their own governance structures.
Above, there are supranational blocs like the European Union and global institutions like the United Nations.
Any discussion of the trilemma must take into account these various levels of governance.
It is true that today’s widespread disillusionment with government is partly a backlash against globalization, which has seemed to impose itself on nation-states.
But another reason for the disillusionment may be that citizens feel disconnected from their national governments.
Yet subnational governments are not so far away, and citizens often feel that they can still exert significant influence over them.
As a result, the tension between democracy and globalization seems to be less acute at, say, the municipal level.
It helps that subnational governments tend to be focused on more local-level concerns – such as infrastructure, education, and housing – that are not perceived as being strongly influenced by globalization.
On the opposite end of the spectrum are supranational governance structures, such as the EU.
Not only does the EU often deal with globalization-related issues like trade; Europe’s citizens feel that the distant and disconnected “Brussels,” over which they have little influence, is infringing on the sovereignty of nation-states.
This sentiment, exemplified in the Brexit vote, can be observed across Europe.
The ways in which these dynamics can complicate Rodrik’s political trilemma have been on stark display in Catalonia, where the tension between local democracy and the nation-state is even more acute than that with globalization.
Indeed, many Catalans are more frustrated with Spain’s national government than they are with either globalization or the EU.
The same can be said of Scotland vis-à-vis the United Kingdom.
In this context, a retreat to the nation-state that rejects globalization, as is occurring in the United States under President Donald Trump, becomes even more problematic, because it threatens to resurrect all of the economic and political pathologies that nationalism incited in the past, and then some.
But what if we adopted a new approach, in which local-level democracy and sovereignty were strengthened instead?
In many countries, if not most, cities are the centers of innovation and progress, as the promise of agglomeration, economies of scale, and positive spillovers attract high-performing firms.
Citizens feel close to their municipal governments and proud of their cities, but their pride in their identity does not have the damaging qualities of nationalism.
As the nation-state cedes some of its power to regional, state, or municipal governments, the trilemma weakens.
Both democracy, with its concomitant sense of belonging, and globalization, driven by cosmopolitan cities open to the world, can thrive, without causing any country to lose sovereignty.
The benefits of such an approach could be profound.
But there are serious risks.
As successful metropolitan areas attract a growing share of a country’s capital, skilled labor, and innovative capacity, rural areas, in particular, are likely to face economic decline: fewer job opportunities, closure of hospitals and schools, and deteriorating infrastructure.
That trend, as we have seen, creates fertile ground for populist politicians to offer simplistic solutions, rooted in extreme ideologies that sow division and undermine progress.
That is why it is vital to find ways to help, from the start, those who may be left behind by such a system.
Here, the nation-state would retain a major role, though an appropriate balance must be struck, in order to prevent the trilemma from reasserting itself.
The Great Populists
WARSAW – The first challenge to the Western hegemony that followed the collapse of Communism in Europe was the emergence of the so-called BRICS countries – Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa – in the 2000s.
Rapidly growing and collectively accounting for nearly half of the world’s population, the rise of the BRICS seemed set to tip the balance of power away from the United States and Western Europe.
Today, the BRICS look like less of a geopolitical threat to the West.
Russia, Brazil, and South Africa are in severe economic straits, and China is wobbling.
Only India maintains its luster.
And yet the West is coming under pressure again, including in its own backyard.
This time, the challenge is political, not economic: the rise of politicians who relish conflict and disdain national and international law and democratic norms.
I call such leaders “PEKOs,” after the four most prominent examples of their kind: Russian President Vladimir Putin, Turkish President Recep Tayyep Erdoğan, the Polish politician Jarosław Kaczyński, and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán.
PEKOs do not view politics as the management of collective emotions in order to achieve broad policy goals: faster economic growth, a more equitable distribution of income, or greater national security, power, and prestige.
Instead, they regard politics as an endless series of intrigues and purges aimed at preserving personal power and privilege.
The PEKOs share the Russian revolutionary Vladimir Lenin’s belief that “politics must take precedence over economics.”
Indeed, they value it over every other kind of policy consideration.
Politics is not a means to an end, but the air they breathe, and policies are merely instruments in their endless struggle to stay alive.
It would be a mistake, however, to think of the PEKOs as today’s equivalent of the “Great Dictators” of the 1930s.
The PEKOs may be nationalists, but their opinions would not have been out of place in the drawing rooms of Europe before World War I (the same cannot be said of the Nazis or the Spanish Falange).
Nor is their economic approach necessarily statist.
Putin certainly has strong dirigiste leanings, but if Orbán and Kaczyński are deserving of the label, then so was French President Charles de Gaulle.
And Erdoğan has actually dismantled Kemalist statism in Turkey and introduced free-market policies.
The biggest difference between the Great Dictators and the PEKOs is that the latter regularly have to face their electorates.
Indeed, their confrontational politics is the central element of their survival strategy.
Each one of them has gained (or maintained) power by polarizing their societies and mobilizing their electoral base.
The PEKOs’ political style has been enabled by modern news media, which, scrambling for audience share, simplify and sensationalize issues.
Starkly antagonistic statements and positions tend to gain the most exposure.
This gives confrontational politicians a powerful advantage, and produces the electoral polarization on which the PEKOs have fed.
This political strategy is undoubtedly effective.
In Russia, for example, real wages fell by more than 9% in 2015, and the share of Russian families that cannot afford adequate food or clothing has increased from 22% to 39%.
And yet Putin’s approval rating remains at 80%.
Unlike the emergence of the BRICS, which ultimately was a boon to the world economy, the rise of the PEKOs poses a real threat – especially as they begin to apply their confrontational approach to foreign affairs and global economic governance.
International firms should be particularly concerned.
Having spread their operations across the world during the quarter-century since the fall of Communism, they have become dependent on rules-based stability and economic integration.
Their fortunes will increasingly depend on developing strategies to avoid (or at least hedge) the new risks posed by PEKOs.
To make matters worse, the PEKO phenomenon seems to be capable of spreading even to the heart of the West.
Examples include Scottish and Catalan nationalists and British politicians campaigning to pull the United Kingdom out of the European Union.
Those who champion these causes have been shockingly dismissive of the massive economic damage their proposals would likely cause their own societies.
Similarly, in at least two major Western democracies, serious candidates for the highest office are acting like PEKOs: US Presidential candidate Donald Trump and the French National Front leader Marine Le Pen, who will seek her country’s presidency in 2017.
If their bids for power succeed, the dangers posed to global stability will rise by an order of magnitude.
Growth Without Industrialization?
CAMBRIDGE – Despite low world prices for the commodities on which they tend to depend, many of the world’s poorest economies have been doing well.
Sub-Saharan Africa’s economic growth has slowed precipitously since 2015, but this reflects specific problems in three of its largest economies (Nigeria, Angola, and South Africa).
Ethiopia, Côte d’Ivoire, Tanzania, Senegal, Burkina Faso, and Rwanda are all projected to achieve growth of 6% or higher this year.
In Asia, the same is true of India, Myanmar, Bangladesh, Lao PDR, Cambodia, and Vietnam.
This is all good news, but it is also puzzling.
Developing economies that manage to grow rapidly on a sustained basis without relying on natural-resource booms – as most of these countries have for a decade or more – typically do so through export-oriented industrialization.
But few of these countries are experiencing much industrialization.
The share of manufacturing in low-income Sub-Saharan countries is broadly stagnant – and in some cases declining.
And despite much talk about “Make in India,” one of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s catchphrases, the country shows little indication of rapid industrialization.
Manufacturing became a powerful escalator of economic development for low-income countries for three reasons. First, it was relatively easy to absorb technology from abroad and generate high-productivity jobs.
Second, manufacturing jobs did not require much skill: farmers could be turned into production workers in factories with little investment in additional training.
And, third, manufacturing demand was not constrained by low domestic incomes: production could expand virtually without limit, through exports.
But things have been changing.
It is now well documented that manufacturing has become increasingly skill-intensive in recent decades.
Along with globalization, this has made it very difficult for newcomers to break into world markets for manufacturing in a big way and replicate the experience of Asia’s manufacturing superstars.
Except for a handful of exporters, developing economies have been experiencing premature deindustrialization.
It seems as if the escalator has been taken away from the lagging countries.
What, then, are we to make of the recent boom in some of the world’s poorest countries?
Have these countries a discovered a new growth model?
In recent research, Xinshen Diao of the International Food Policy Research Institute, Margaret McMillan of Tufts University, and I have looked at the growth patterns among this new crop of high-performing countries.
Our focus is on the patterns of structural change these countries have experienced. We document a couple of paradoxical findings.
First, growth-promoting structural change has been significant in the recent experience of low-income countries such as Ethiopia, Malawi, Senegal, and Tanzania, despite the absence of industrialization.
Labor has been moving from low-productivity agricultural activities to higher-productivity activities, but the latter are mostly services rather than manufacturing.
Second, rapid structural change in these countries has come at the expense of mostly negative labor productivity growth within non-agricultural sectors.
In other words, even though the services that absorbed new employment exhibited relatively high productivity early on, their edge diminished as they expanded.
This pattern contrasts sharply with the classic East Asian growth experience (such as in South Korea and China), in which structural change and gains in non-agricultural labor productivity both contributed strongly to overall growth.
The difference seems to be explained by the fact that the expansion of urban, modern sectors in recent high-growth episodes is driven by domestic demand rather than export-oriented industrialization.
In particular, the African model appears to be underpinned by positive aggregate demand shocks generated either by transfers from abroad or by productivity growth in agriculture.
In Ethiopia, for example, public investments in irrigation, transport, and power have produced a significant increase in agricultural productivity and incomes. This results in growth-promoting structural change, as increased demand spills over to non-agricultural sectors.
But non-agricultural labor productivity is driven down as a by-product, as returns to capital diminish and less productive firms are drawn in.
This is not to downplay the significance of rapid productivity growth in agriculture, the archetypal traditional sector.
Our research suggests that agriculture has played a key role in Africa not only on its own account, but also as a driver of growth-increasing structural change.
Diversification into non-traditional products and adoption of new production techniques can transform agriculture into a quasi-modern activity.
But there are limits to how far this process can carry the economy.
In part because of low income elasticity of demand for agricultural products, outflows of labor from agriculture are an inevitable outcome during the process of development.
The labor that is released must be absorbed in modern activities.
And if productivity is not growing in these modern sectors, economy-wide growth ultimately will stall.
The contribution that the structural-change component can make is necessarily self-limiting if the modern sector does not experience rapid productivity growth on its own.
Low-income African countries can sustain moderate rates of productivity growth into the future, on the back of steady improvements in human capital and governance. Continued convergence with rich-country income levels seems achievable.
But the evidence suggests that the growth rates brought about recently by rapid structural change are exceptional and may not last.
Francis of the Forest
WASHINGTON, DC – When Pope Francis visited Latin America in July, he made an impassioned plea for the protection of the Amazon rainforest and the people who live there.
“Our common home is being pillaged, laid waste and harmed with impunity,” he told activists gathered in Bolivia for the World Meeting of Popular Movements.
“Cowardice in defending it is a grave sin.”
Heeding Francis’s call for action is not only a moral issue; it is a practical one.
When world leaders meet at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris later this year to craft a response to the challenges of global warming, they should put in place policies to protect tropical forests and the people who make them their home.
Francis is hardly the first missionary to have visited the Amazon.
Franciscan, Jesuit, and Dominican priests have been spreading the gospel in the region for centuries.
What makes Francis’s appeal different is that his words were directed not so much at the local population, but at the residents of North America and Europe, where demand for timber, biofuels, and agricultural products drives the destruction of the rainforests and imperils the lives of indigenous populations.
Communities in the Amazon have suffered grievously from the economic incentives to cut down the rainforests.
Around the world, indigenous people are being threatened, murdered, and driven from their homelands.
Of the 116 environmental activists killed in 2014, 40% were indigenous leaders.
In September 2014, for example, Edwin Chota and three other leaders of the Asháninka communities in Peru, were brutally murdered, most likely by illegal loggers.
Two months later, José Isidro Tendetza Antún, a leader of the Shuar people in Ecuador, was tortured and killed while headed to a protest against a mining project that threatened his people’s homeland.
In addition to being an affront to human rights, deforestation and the accompanying assault on indigenous cultures is a serious threat to the fight against climate change.
The links between the loss of forest cover and global warming has been well documented.
Carbon-dioxide emissions from forest clearing and burning account for nearly 10% of global emissions.
Meanwhile, forest people have demonstrated that they are often the best guardians of the trees on which their livelihoods depend.
The forests where indigenous people live often hold more carbon than those managed by any other owners, public or private.
Indeed, indigenous reserves in the Brazilian Amazon have played a critical role in lowering deforestation rates – at a considerable cost.
In the past 12 years, more activists and indigenous leaders have been killed in Brazil than in any other country.
During the proceedings in Paris later this year, countries will be expected to present national plans – known as Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) – outlining the specific steps they will take to reduce CO2 emissions.
If Francis’s appeal is to be respected, these steps must include commitments to help indigenous people secure the right to their land and empower them to protect their forests against destruction.
So far, only a little more than one-quarter of the world’s countries have submitted preliminary INDCs for review.
Unfortunately, few countries with tropical forests have submitted their plans, and not one of the Amazon countries has done so.
Mexico, by contrast, is setting a good example.
The government has used its INDC to set several ambitious goals, including commitments to zero deforestation by the year 2030 and to restoring forest ecosystems in the country’s watersheds.
And yet, while Mexico has relatively strong formal land and property rights for indigenous peoples and local communities, those rights have yet to be integrated with other regulations – hindering any kind of economic development.
Industrialized countries, such as the United States and the members of the European Union, bear a special responsibility for providing solutions to the problem of deforestation.
Forest communities must be provided with assistance in managing their resources and maintaining their livelihoods.
The Green Climate Fund, established by the United Nations to help developing countries mitigate CO2 emissions and adapt to climate change, should include provisions specifically for indigenous people, along the lines of the Climate Investment Fund’s Dedicated Grant Mechanism.
Francis’s upcoming trips will include visits to Washington, DC and Paris, where he is expected to continue his advocacy on behalf of the environment.
It is up to our leaders to answer his call and turn prayers into policy.
A British Test of Reason
PARIS – If voters in the United Kingdom decide in the country’s referendum on June 23 to leave the European Union, it will not be for economic reasons.
They may choose Brexit because they want full sovereignty, because they hate Brussels, or because they want migrants to return home, but not because they expect great economic benefits.
The pro-Brexit camp initially appeared to be holding two strong economic cards.
The first was UK citizens’ overwhelming rejection of their country’s net fiscal transfer to the rest of the EU, which currently amounts to 0.4% of GDP.
Since Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher first demanded to have “her money back” in 1979, the budgetary costs of EU membership have completely overshadowed its economic benefits in the public’s view.
The second card was the sorry state of continental Europe’s economy.
In terms of GDP growth, employment, or innovation, other EU countries, on average, lag behind the UK (and, to an even greater extent, the United States).
Whereas EU membership was once regarded as a gateway to prosperity, it is increasingly viewed as a drag on progress.
But lately, as John Van Reenen of the London School of Economics recently put it, the economic case for Brexit has been largely missing in action.
Its advocates are at pains to explain what kind of trade and partnership agreements, if any, Britain could enter into with the EU, much less how those agreements would be superior to the current arrangement.
As a result, it is tough to argue that the UK would receive a net economic boost – or even that it will not suffer considerably – by leaving the EU.
Of the eight economic evaluations recently surveyed by the Institute for Fiscal Studies, a respected independent research institution, only one claims that leaving the EU would lead to significant economic gains.
And that study – produced, unsurprisingly, by Economists for Brexit – has been sharply criticized by the rest of the economic profession for lacking an appropriate analytical basis.
Most studies find that Britain would suffer significantly from leaving the EU.
UK exporters would end up participating less in the large EU market, and they would be shut out of EU-negotiated agreements ensuring access to major international markets.
While the UK could negotiate new agreements with these partners, that would take time, and, acting alone, its negotiating power would presumably be weaker.
This means that the UK would trade less with EU and non-EU partners alike.
It would pay higher prices for inputs and consumer goods, and British firms’ reduced integration into global value chains would undermine productivity.
The cost in terms of foregone GDP would be 5-20 times higher than the saving implied by not contributing to the EU budget.
That is not an appealing deal, to say the least.
All modern analysis of economic internationalization shows that foreign trade is a powerful selection mechanism.
It provides major growth opportunities for the most productive and innovative firms, while enabling them to learn from their overseas competitors.
It is no accident that the world’s best firms – which have the highest productivity, profits, and wages, and invest in strengthening human capital – are trade champions.
Brexit’s adverse impact on UK firms’ scope for development would further increase the economic cost.
These arguments have been forcefully advanced ahead of the referendum.
Yet they have not simplified the debate on the costs and benefits of Brexit.
This may be partly because that debate has not played out along party lines.
Prime Minister David Cameron’s Conservatives are deeply divided on the topic, while Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party is lukewarm about the EU.
Because the choice is not between left and right, independent views have gained greater weigtht.
The June 23 referendum is important in its own right, owing to its far-reaching implications for the UK’s relationship with Europe.
But it will also deliver broader lessons.
If British voters decide to leave the EU, it will indicate that rational economic arguments carry less weight than emotional appeals.
Such an outcome will bolster populist forces elsewhere – from Italy to France to the US – in their advocacy of isolationist policies that most experts regard as economic nonsense.
To oppose such forces and policies, mainstream political parties will have to address their failure, even with the facts on their side, to offer a narrative compelling enough to convince voters to choose economic openness.
A vote by a majority of British citizens to remain in the EU would have the opposite impact, highlighting that, whatever negative feelings people may have about a policy or entity, reason and logic cannot be tossed aside.
Equally important, such an outcome could encourage greater scrutiny of the economic consequences of populist programs in the US and the rest of Europe.
What is at stake in the June 23 referendum is therefore not only the relationship between Britain and the EU – or even the future of the “European project.”
How voters decide will be an important test of whether democratic choices in advanced countries are governed by economic rationality or popular passions.
Politics in the Way of Progress
BERKELEY – There are 17 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which aim to tackle problems including poverty, hunger, disease, inequality, climate change, ecological degradation, and many others in between.
Clearly, 17 is too many.
As Frederick the Great supposedly said, “He who defends everything defends nothing.”
Similarly, those who emphasize everything emphasize nothing.
This points to the problem of forging goals through consensus: they can end up being a wish list for everything short of heaven on Earth.
But, to be effective, goals should operate like turnpikes, which allow you to make progress toward a specific destination much faster than if you had taken the scenic route.
The purpose of consensus building, then, should be to get us to the on-ramp, after which it becomes harder to make a wrong turn or reverse course.
Still, there could be obstacles on the road ahead.
For Tsinghua University’s Andrew Sheng and Xiao Geng of the University of Hong Kong, these include “technological disruption, geopolitical rivalry, and widening social inequality,” but, above all, “populist calls for nationalist policies, including trade protectionism.”
Sheng and Geng see a world in which “the sovereign state still reigns supreme, with national interests overshadowing shared objectives.”
They point out that, for advanced and developing economies alike, “paying for global public goods has become all the more unappealing,” given that “both democratic and authoritarian governance” have struggled to deliver “equitable development.”
Their conclusion is that “achieving the SDGs will probably be impossible” in a world beholden to “the antiquated Westphalian model of nation-states.”
After all, there is “no global tax mechanism to ensure the provision of global public goods,” and “no global monetary or welfare policies to maintain price stability and social peace.”
Another obstacle, argues Mark Suzman of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, is that “without a more deliberate, data-driven focus on the needs of women and girls in particular, progress toward a wide range of [SDG] objectives will suffer.”
Over the past two centuries, the world has made significant strides in reducing infant mortality, such that the typical woman no longer has to spend five years of her life pregnant and another ten years nursing.
Yet traditional patriarchal systems are still blocking women from contributing as much as they otherwise could, and without more data, we cannot see where those blockages are occurring.
Nobel laureate economist Michael Spence, for his part, warns that as long as there are “non-inclusive growth patterns” in both developing and advanced economies, there is little hope of “reducing poverty and fulfilling basic human aspirations for health, security, and the chance to contribute productively and creatively to society.”
And, complicating matters further, inequitable growth risks fueling “political or social turmoil, often marked by ideological or ethnic polarization, which then leads either to wide policy swings or to policy paralysis.”
And Kaushik Basu of Cornell University laments that a “growth slowdown” in India, once “a poster child for political stability and economic growth among emerging economies,” has become a “source of serious concern not just domestically, but around the world.”
To right the Indian ship, Basu calls on the government to focus its development efforts on specific sectors such as health, education, and medical tourism, and to do more to attract capital investment.
To me, a common underlying concern in all of these commentaries is not so much economics as politics and people – and a politics of people.
We live in a world that is far richer than that of any previous generation.
In theory, it should be easy to ensure that all people have the nutrition and health care they need to live full lives.
Educating all people so that they can make the best use of modern technologies and the other resources at their disposal should be rather straightforward.
And it should be obvious to everyone – even the richest among us – that providing comfort in old age, and prosperity for the next generation, requires that the wealthiest pay enough in taxes to ensure that growth is truly and equitably shared.
The problem is that while many people work toward the SDGs, political confidence men (and some women) are throwing up new barriers, by stoking the resentments of those who have benefited the most from inequitable growth, as well as those who have missed out.
In the United States, one can see this every hour on Fox News, where Mexican auto-parts workers, Salvadoran refugees, Muslims, “ungrateful” non-white Americans, and “globalists” of all stripes are routinely vilified.
And, of course, one can see the same thing in other countries around the world.
But many of those sitting at home watching cable news (or reading commentaries about the SDGs) hail from the top 50% of the income distribution in the Global North, or from the top 20% in the Global South.
We are the ones who need to be sufficiently grateful for our circumstances.
Some of us have much more than others; but we all have far more than we deserve.
Then again, perhaps we should stop thinking in terms of what is “deserved” at all.
“For we each of us deserve everything,” a character in Ursula K. Le Guin’s 1974 novel The Dispossessed reminds us, “and we each of us deserve nothing.”
In other words, achieving the SDGs may require a radically different approach.
“Free your mind of the idea of deserving, the idea of earning,” Le Guin’s character continues, “and you will begin to be able to think.”
The Crisis of Market Fundamentalism
LONDON – The biggest political surprise of 2016 was that everyone was so surprised.
I certainly had no excuse to be caught unawares: soon after the 2008 crisis, I wrote a book suggesting that a collapse of confidence in political institutions would follow the economic collapse, with a lag of five years or so.
We’ve seen this sequence before.
The first breakdown of globalization, described by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels in their 1848 The Communist Manifesto, was followed by reform laws creating unprecedented rights for the working class.
The breakdown of British imperialism after World War I was followed by the New Deal and the welfare state.
And the breakdown of Keynesian economics after 1968 was followed by the Thatcher-Reagan revolution.
In my book Capitalism 4.0, I argued that comparable political upheavals would follow the fourth systemic breakdown of global capitalism heralded by the 2008 crisis.
When a particular model of capitalism is working successfully, material progress relieves political pressures.
But when the economy fails – and the failure is not just a transient phase but a symptom of deep contradictions – capitalism’s disruptive social side effects can turn politically toxic.
That is what happened after 2008.
Once the failure of free trade, deregulation, and monetarism came to be seen as leading to a “new normal” of permanent austerity and diminished expectations, rather than just to a temporary banking crisis, the inequalities, job losses, and cultural dislocations of the pre-crisis period could no longer be legitimized – just as the extortionate taxes of the 1950s and 1960s lost their legitimacy in the stagflation of the 1970s.
If we are witnessing this kind of transformation, then piecemeal reformers who try to address specific grievances about immigration, trade, or income inequality will lose out to radical politicians who challenge the entire system.
And, in some ways, the radicals will be right.
The disappearance of “good” manufacturing jobs cannot be blamed on immigration, trade, or technology.
But whereas these vectors of economic competition increase total national income, they do not necessarily distribute income gains in a socially acceptable way.
To do that requires deliberate political intervention on at least two fronts.
First, macroeconomic management must ensure that demand always grows as strongly as the supply potential created by technology and globalization.
This is the fundamental Keynesian insight that was temporarily rejected in the heyday of monetarism during the early 1980s, successfully reinstated in the 1990s (at least in the US and Britain), but then forgotten again in the deficit panic after 2009.
A return to Keynesian demand management could be the main economic benefit of Donald Trump’s incoming US administration, as expansionary fiscal policies replace much less efficient efforts at monetary stimulus.
The US may now be ready to abandon the monetarist dogmas of central-bank independence and inflation targeting, and to restore full employment as the top priority of demand management.
For Europe, however, this revolution in macroeconomic thinking is still years away.
At the same time, a second, more momentous, intellectual revolution will be needed regarding government intervention in social outcomes and economic structures.
Market fundamentalism conceals a profound contradiction.
Free trade, technological progress, and other forces that promote economic “efficiency” are presented as beneficial to society, even if they harm individual workers or businesses, because growing national incomes allow winners to compensate losers, ensuring that nobody is left worse off.
This principle of so-called Pareto optimality underlies all moral claims for free-market economics.
Liberalizing policies are justified in theory only by the assumption that political decisions will redistribute some of the gains from winners to losers in socially acceptable ways.
But what happens if politicians do the opposite in practice?
By deregulating finance and trade, intensifying competition, and weakening unions, governments created the theoretical conditions that demanded redistribution from winners to losers.
But advocates of market fundamentalism did not just forget redistribution; they forbade it.
The pretext was that taxes, welfare payments, and other government interventions impair incentives and distort competition, reducing economic growth for society as a whole.
But, as Margaret Thatcher famously said, “[…] there’s no such thing as society.
There are individual men and women and there are families.”
By focusing on the social benefits of competition while ignoring the costs to specific people, the market fundamentalists disregarded the principle of individualism at the heart of their own ideology.
After this year’s political upheavals, the fatal contradiction between social benefits and individual losses can no longer be ignored.
If trade, competition, and technological progress are to power the next phase of capitalism, they will have to be paired with government interventions to redistribute the gains from growth in ways that Thatcher and Reagan declared taboo.
Breaking these taboos need not mean returning to the high tax rates, inflation, and dependency culture of the 1970s.
Just as fiscal and monetary policy can be calibrated to minimize both unemployment and inflation, redistribution can be designed not merely to recycle taxes into welfare, but to help more directly when workers and communities suffer from globalization and technological change.
Instead of providing cash handouts that push people from work into long-term unemployment or retirement, governments can redistribute the benefits of growth by supporting employment and incomes with regional and industrial subsidies and minimum-wage laws.
Among the most effective interventions of this type, demonstrated in Germany and Scandinavia, is to spend money on high-quality vocational education and re-training for workers and students outside universities, creating non-academic routes to a middle-class standard of living.
These may all sound like obvious nostrums, but governments have mostly done the opposite.
They have made tax systems less progressive and slashed spending on education, industrial policies and regional subsidies, pouring money instead into health care, pensions, and cash hand-outs that encourage early retirement and disability.
The redistribution has been away from low-paid young workers, whose jobs and wages are genuinely threatened by trade and immigration, and toward the managerial and financial elites, who have gained the most from globalization, and elderly retirees, whose guaranteed pensions protect them from economic disruptions.
Yet this year’s political upheavals have been driven by elderly voters, while young voters mostly supported the status quo.
This paradox shows the post-crisis confusion and disillusionment is not yet over.
But the search for new economic models that I called “Capitalism 4.1” has clearly started – for better or worse.
Only More Europe Can Beat Europe’s Nationalists
BRUSSELS – British voters’ choice to leave the European Union is unfortunate, but unsurprising.
For decades, British politicians have avoided making the case for EU membership, or even explaining to the British people how the Union works and why it is necessary.
Throughout his premiership, David Cameron failed to show any leadership or willingness to engage in a meaningful way with the EU.
One foot was always out the door as he repeatedly railed against faceless bureaucrats in Brussels.
Sadly, his last-minute attempt to defend EU membership during the Brexit campaign was not enough to undo the effects on British public opinion of decades of lies.
Britain has chosen isolation in Europe, against the advice of its friends and allies.
Now that its post-imperial decline is complete, the most important lesson to take away from the “Brexit” referendum that sealed its fate is that one cannot defeat nationalism by pandering to nationalists.
If the EU wants to tackle the strains of nationalism that are undermining its very raison d'être, it will have to listen to people’s concerns and offer a radical new vision for effective governance.
Otherwise, the nationalist cancer will spread.
To begin with, the remaining EU countries must now uphold European law and push for a quick and clean divorce.
The United Kingdom’s citizens voted to leave, and its political leaders insist that they will respect the referendum’s outcome, so it is not “punishment” to insist that they do so as soon as possible.
If British inaction causes Europe to continue to suffer economically from political uncertainty, a full separation should be carried out unilaterally.
Politically, the UK is already on its way to becoming an adversary, rather than a trusted partner, of the EU.
Before reversing herself under fire, Theresa May – the home secretary, who is now the leading candidate to succeed Cameron as Prime Minister – implicitly threatened the future status of EU nationals living in the UK by promising only that they would be “part of the negotiation” for Britain’s exit.
May actually opposed Brexit.
Yet her anti-European hostility differs only in degree, not in kind, from that of pro-Brexit politicians, such as Daniel Hannan, a Conservative MEP, and Nigel Farage, the leader of the UK Independence Party, who rejoice at the possibility of additional exit referenda across the EU.
Fortunately, post-Brexit contagion has so far failed to materialize, most likely thanks to the embarrassing public spectacle that the UK has become since June 23, with its economic prospects dimming, its financial sector – a global powerhouse – scouting new locations, and its leaders stabbing one another in the back.
In fact, the referendum may have even prompted EU countries – including those with noisy Euroskeptic parties, such as Denmark and Sweden – to close ranks in support of EU membership.
A post-referendum poll in Sweden found 66% of respondents still in favor of EU membership.
In Denmark, similar polling after the Brexit referendum showed a 9% jump in support of EU membership.
EU leaders must not sit on their hands.
The Brexit crisis should be treated as an opportunity for the Union, given that concerns about globalization, terrorism, immigration, and inequality are now mainstream.
A divided Europe has failed to respond to these challenges; and, while the British will be missed, the EU will now be less divided.
Still, today’s EU is not capable of decisive, large-scale action.
To provide an alternative to the emotional appeal of populist nationalism, the Union must become more responsive to its citizens’ demands.
This will require radical structural reforms to the eurozone and to the EU’s central political institutions.
Economists generally agree that a single currency without a fiscal union or a common treasury is unsustainable.
If Europeans do not finish the job they started when they established the euro, they will continue to experience the economic pain of structural disunity.
Complete integration would deliver prosperity and better governance.
Europe’s security arrangements suffer similar shortfalls.
It is absurd that Europe has the globally respected European Space Agency, but no credible organization to collect and share intelligence in the fight against terrorism.
The attacks in Paris last November should have made it obvious that borderless terrorism demands borderless intelligence, yet EU member states continue to put individual sovereignty ahead of collective security.
More inter-governmental cooperation simply won’t do.
Europe needs a central intelligence authority with teeth.
Only by starting on such far-reaching reforms can Europe begin to stem the rise of populism that led to the success of the UK’s “Leave” campaign.
Some would say that more sovereign powers should be returned to EU member states. I could not disagree more.
This would only further weaken the project of integration that has safeguarded peace and prosperity in Europe for decades.
Populism and Euroskepticism are the enemies of that project. The only way to beat them is to build a Europe that works for its citizens.
Anything less works only for the demagogues who would follow the UK into the wilderness.
The UK’s Multilateral Trade Future
CAMBRIDGE – As the United Kingdom negotiates the terms of its divorce from the European Union, it would be wise for the country’s leaders to begin looking further into the future to determine what approach to international trade relations would serve it best.
Does the UK really want to hang its future on bilateral agreements with a long list of individual trade partners?
Or would it be better off joining existing mega-regional free-trade agreements, while working to strengthen the global multilateral system under the World Trade Organization?
The bilateral approach would demand a huge amount of time and resources, with UK negotiators engaging in a series of discussions with each and every country with which they wanted to do business.
The end result would be a tangled network of deals that would only exacerbate the balkanization of the international trading system.
This approach limits gains from trade.
For example, the Inter-American Development Bank reports that the trade gains from Latin America’s 33 small regional trade agreements have been meager.
The key to boosting those gains, according to the IADB, is to adopt a new strategy that expands access across and within markets.
This suggests that, for the UK, mega-regional trade agreements – which provide access to multiple markets, but entail lower levels of fiscal and regulatory integration than the EU – are the best way forward.
After all, it is this approach that would enable UK firms to position themselves in well-developed and integrated supply chains, serving much larger markets than those to which a bilateral agreement would grant them access.
The argument can be made that a multilateral approach is not just the better option; it is the only one.
Consider the recent challenges faced by Bombardier, a Canadian multinational that produces 100-150-seat passenger jets using globally sourced parts, including wings made by Bombardier UK, the largest manufacturing employer in Northern Ireland.
Bombardier negotiated the sale of up to 125 of its jets to Delta Air Lines.
But the American aviation giant Boeing challenged the sale, alleging that, enabled by subsidies at home, Bombardier was selling the jets at below-market rates, giving the company an unfair advantage.
Despite loud protests from Canada and the UK, the US Department of Commerce now seems set to impose an extremely high import tariff of about 300%.
The effects of that duty will radiate throughout the supply chain, hitting the 4,200 employees of Bombardier UK.
This experience demonstrates the limitations of bilateral agreements, especially in a world where supply chains and markets extend far beyond the countries involved.
The UK may negotiate a bilateral free-trade agreement with, say, Canada, but UK firms will secure few benefits, unless Canadian firms can sell products with UK components to their other trading partners.
The Bombardier episode also highlights the importance of engagement in – and reform of – the WTO, under whose rules the US-initiated proceedings against Bombardier are taking place.
The impact of WTO rules and resolution mechanisms is far-reaching, as 164 countries worldwide subscribe to them.
Yet WTO rules have their flaws.
For example, they allow exporting countries to provide financial support and subsidies to specific industries; but they also give importing countries the right to use tariffs to offset these subsidies.
The WTO has heard countless disputes over its subsidies and dumping rules, and it is now sure to hear one more, over the Bombardier case, because the US and Canada have different ideas about how to interpret these rules.
Though no one is happy with the current WTO rules, efforts to reform them have so far ended in deadlock.
But recent high-value cases involving high-tech products like airplanes, semiconductors, and green technologies, including solar panels and biodiesel, make clear that the problem cannot be ignored.
And the fact is that concerns over state aid and competition policy can be addressed only in a multilateral forum like the WTO.
Because the UK has historically shown far less appetite for industrial subsidies than its trading partners have, it stands to gain from clear international rules on industrial support and anti-subsidy tariffs.
Given this, the UK has a strong incentive to engage with – and help to upgrade – the WTO.
Another multilateral forum that could prove invaluable to the UK is the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a mega-regional trade agreement that provides for duty-free trade and includes modest commitments in areas like state aid and competition policy, without requiring EU-level integration.
Though the TPP suffered a setback last year, when Donald Trump withdrew the United States, last month the 11 Pacific Rim countries remaining in the deal committed to keeping it alive.
The TPP does not have to limit its membership to the Pacific; the UK could engage with it.
Given its free-trade credentials and international stature, the UK could help to breathe new life into these and other trade negotiations that have been thrown into disarray by the Trump administration’s protectionist impulses.
With Brexit looming, the UK has no choice but to redesign its future trading relationships.
As a major producer of sophisticated components, its long-term trade strategy should focus on gaining deep and unfettered access to integrated cross-border supply chains.
That means pivoting away from bilateral deals, toward a multilateral approach that enables the country to rebalance and expand its trading arrangements around the world.
Poverty Is Also a Psychosocial Problem
BRIGHTON – Being poor is a highly shameful experience, degrading one’s dignity and sense of self-worth.
While the manifestations and causes of poverty differ, the humiliation that accompanies it is universal.
Recent research conducted at the University of Oxford found that from China to the United Kingdom, people facing economic hardship – even children – experience a nearly identical assault on their pride and self-esteem.
Yet, despite the clear evidence linking poverty to psychological distress, policies tacking poverty do not typically take shame into account.
Rather, poverty reduction efforts tend to focus on tangible manifestations of deprivation such as lack of income or education.
As a result, solutions to poverty often implicitly assume that more material wealth or improved living conditions will automatically translate into non-tangible benefits, including improved mental wellbeing.
This lack of focus on the “psychosocial” side of poverty – the interaction between social forces and individual attitude or behavior – is misguided.
If we are to alleviate human suffering and achieve the UN’s premier Sustainable Development Goal of ending poverty “in all its forms” by 2030, addressing the intrinsic and instrumental roles that shame plays in poverty must be front and center in our efforts.
The crippling sense of dishonor that accompanies poverty, and impedes people from taking positive action to improve their situation, has been seen around the world.
In India, the shame associated with crop losses and financial stress has pushed farmers to substance abuse and, in extreme cases, suicide.
In Tanzania, researchers studying bilingual education have found that a fear of being mocked can prevent students with weaker English skills from participating in class.
And in Uganda, poor high school students say the inability to pay fees, purchase uniforms, or obtain school supplies is a constant source of humiliation.
To address poverty-related shame, and adequately account for the role shame plays in perpetuating poverty, a number of steps must be taken.
For starters, policymakers should recognize the problem.
Rather than seeing shame as an unfortunate byproduct of living in poverty, human development planners should consider how poverty undermines human dignity.
The Nobel economics laureate Amartya Sen, one of the most influential voices on poverty reduction, has long argued that shame is a driver of “absolute” poverty.
Taking shame seriously must be part of any poverty-reduction strategy.
Moreover, shame, a lack of self-confidence, and low self-esteem can negatively impact how people view their ability to affect change, sustaining a perception of inadequacy that can be debilitating and trap them in poverty.
To help people escape, human development strategies must consider how to bolster personal agency, aspiration, and self-efficacy – the belief in one’s ability to influence events that affect one’s life.
Finally, policymakers must be aware that programs aimed at reducing poverty, if not properly implemented, can actually increase feelings of shame.
For example, researchers working in India in 2005 found that Indian women stopped going to health clinics in order to avoid debasing treatment by health workers – to the detriment of their own wellbeing and that of their children.
Women in South Africa applying for child support grants have reported similar experiences, as have food bank users in the UK.
In fact, many respondents in Britain said the stigma of receiving free food was so severe that “fear” and “embarrassment” were common emotions.
The issue of shame, and the need to take it more seriously in poverty-reduction policies, is slowly gaining traction.
Academics who research human suffering have recognized that “recipient dignity” is a crucial component of successful poverty alleviation.
For example, a 2016 review of cash transfer programs in Africa found that the absence of stress and shame enhanced confidence in recipients, leading to improved decision-making and productivity.
Building on such evidence, the University of Oxford is extending its research on the “shame-poverty nexus,” to study how the international development sector can “shame-proof” anti-poverty policies.
Programs aimed at reducing poverty are moving in the right direction, but much work remains to be done to integrate the psychosocial component of poverty into policy and planning.
Only when policymakers truly grasp that dignity and self-respect are unavoidable prerequisites in the struggle against deprivation – rather than outcomes of its alleviation – will the world have a fighting chance of eradicating poverty in all its forms.
The Power of Monuments
NEW YORK – The ghastly spectacle last month of neo-Nazis marching through Charlottesville, Virginia, carrying torches and barking slogans about the supremacy of the white race, was sparked by the city’s plans to remove a statue of Robert E. Lee, the leader of the Confederate army, which fought to retain slavery in the secessionist South during the American Civil War.
The statue of General Lee on his horse has been there since 1924, a time when the lynching of black citizens was not a rarity.
Inspired by the events taking place in Charlottesville, advocates have emerged in Britain seeking to pull Admiral Nelson off his famous column on Trafalgar Square in London, because the British naval hero supported the slave trade.
And two years ago, protesters at the University of Oxford demanded the removal of a sculpture of Cecil Rhodes from Oriel College, where the old imperialist had once been a student, because his views on race and empire are now considered to be obnoxious.
There always was something magical about this kind of iconoclasm, which rests on the belief that smashing an image will somehow solve the problems associated with it.
When English Protestants challenged the power of the Roman Catholic Church in the sixteenth century, mobs laid waste to stone-carved saints and other holy representations with pick-hammers and axes.
Eighteenth-century revolutionaries did the same to churches in France.
The most radical example occurred in China only a little more than 50 years ago, when Red Guards destroyed Buddhist temples and burned Confucian books – or indeed anything old and traditional – to herald the Cultural Revolution.
It is easy to deplore this type of destruction.
Great buildings and works of art are lost.
One is tempted to assume that only people who believe in the magical power of images would wish to erase them.
The sensible way to deal with monuments of the past would be to see them simply as artifacts of history.
And yet it is not so simple.
Who would argue that after 1945 streets and squares in German cities should continue to be named after Adolf Hitler?
It was surely not just a childish mistake to remove sculptures of the Führer – or of Soviet leaders in Central and Eastern Europe after 1989.
One could argue that images of these leaders and their henchmen lacked the artistic value of great churches of medieval England, or Tang Dynasty Buddhist sculptures in China.
But then statues of General Lee are hardly worth preserving for artistic reasons either.
The question is where we should draw the line.
Should a historical figure be judged by the amount of blood on his hands?
Or should we establish a proper time frame?
It might be argued that monuments celebrating villains who lived within living memory and would still cause grief to surviving victims must be removed, and that anything older should be left alone.
But that doesn’t quite work, either.
The argument for preserving a sculpture of Hitler in a public place, assuming that such a thing still exists, does not get stronger as time goes on.
Many people in the US South argue that Confederate monuments should be protected as mere reminders of the past, as part of a common “heritage.”
The problem is that history is not always neutral.
It can still be toxic.
The way we tell stories of our past, and keep memories alive in cultural artifacts, is a large part of how we view ourselves collectively.
This demands a certain degree of consensus, which often does not exist, especially when there has been a civil war.
The case of postwar Germany is quite straightforward.
Both East and West Germany set out to build their collective futures in direct contrast to the Nazi past.
Only a resentful fringe still wishes to cling to fond memories of the Third Reich.
Nonetheless, to this day, German authorities ban the display of Nazi imagery, fearing that it might still tempt people to repeat the darkest episodes of their country’s history.
This fear is understandable, and not wholly irrational.
Such temptations could even become stronger as Nazism fades from living memory.
Britain has a less traumatic recent history.
The views of Cecil Rhodes, or Admiral Nelson, though fairly conventional in their time, are certainly no longer fashionable today.
It is highly unlikely that many British people gazing up at Nelson on his column or passing Oriel College, Oxford, will be inspired to advocate slavery or build an empire in Africa.
The American South, however, is still a problem.
The losers in the Civil War were never quite reconciled to their defeat.
For many southerners, though by no means all, the Confederate cause and its monuments are still felt to be part of their collective identity.
Although hardly anyone in his right mind would advocate the revival of slavery, nostalgia for the Old South is still tinged with racism.
That is why statues of General Lee in front of court buildings and other public places are noxious, and why many people, including southern liberals, wish to see them removed.
There is no perfect solution to this problem, precisely because it is not just about images carved from stone.
Resentment in the South is political.
The wounds of the Civil War remain unhealed.
Much of the rural south is poorer and less educated than other parts of the US.
People feel ignored and looked down upon by urban coastal elites.
That is why so many of them voted for Donald Trump.
Knocking down a few statues will not solve this problem. It might even make matters worse.
Publicizing the Plight of Journalists
AMSTERDAM – Every five days, on average, somewhere in the world, a journalist is murdered for being a journalist.
Nine out of ten times, no one is prosecuted, creating an atmosphere of impunity that extends beyond death threats or violence.
Imprisonment of journalists is at an all-time high, and members of the press routinely suffer harassment and intimidation while on assignment.
Today, journalism is one of the most dangerous professions anywhere.
One way to address this state of affairs is by talking about it.
Three recent examples highlight the risks journalists take to report the news, and underscore why publicizing their plight is the only way to bring about change.
Consider Maria Ressa, CEO of Rappler.com, an online news network based in the Philippines.
Since founding Rappler in 2012, Ressa’s website has become an invaluable source of information about the extrajudicial killings linked to President Rodrigo Duterte’s “war on drugs.”
For her enterprising reporting, Ressa has received more than 80 death threats in the last month alone.
Many of these warnings have come from anonymous bloggers, with IP addresses traceable to the president’s associates.
Then there is the case of William Ntege, a journalist who reported on recent protests against Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni’s decision to run in the next presidential election, despite constitutional prohibitions preventing him from doing so.
Ntege was severely beaten by police for his coverage, and held in jail for more than ten days.
Finally, there is the erosion of press freedoms in Myanmar.
A new clause written into the country’s media law allows citizens to file a lawsuit if they have a complaint with an article or news item, even if the reporting does not directly mention them.
This legal provision – in sharp contrast to international norms – has led to 61 cases filed against journalists since February 2016, when Aung San Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy came to power.
Infringements of press freedom like these have become common tactics for autocratic regimes, from Turkey to Russia and beyond.
But it is not only despots and strongmen who have declared war on the press.
In Colombia and Mexico, hundreds of journalists have been placed under armed guard to protect them from criminal syndicates.
Yet this hasn’t stopped journalists across Latin America from leaving the profession in droves.
A favorite strategy of Mexican drug gangs seeking to stay out of the headlines is to threaten investigative journalists’ children.
No wonder the media’s ranks are shrinking.
Part of the reason most consumers of news do not know these stories is that organizations like mine have long worked to ensure that journalists never become the story.
Press freedom groups have typically operated under the assumption that the best way to protect fact-based, investigative journalism is to shield the storyteller from violence.
And, like most journalists, we have opted to do our jobs quietly, rather than burdening readers and viewers with how dangerous the profession has become.
But it is time to change our approach, and make a point of highlighting the hazards.
For example, Ntege was released only after considerable effort by a team of lawyers retained by Reporters Respond, the Free Press Unlimited emergency fund for journalist safety.
Since the fund’s inception in 2011, it has helped dozens of journalists around the world, including, most recently, a group of reporters fleeing mob violence in Burundi.
And a huge number of organizations aid journalists in distress in the Middle East, in Eastern Europe, and elsewhere.
These stories behind the news must be told.
Of course, telling these tales is just the beginning.
Press freedom advocates must also deliver journalists a stronger, more coordinated framework for their protection and safety.
To that end, my organization is engaging with other global entities to strengthen the UN Plan of Action on the Safety of Journalists and the Issue of Impunity.
We have also begun holding regular meetings with other media freedom groups to devise a path forward.
And, we have started working to ensure that media protections are backed up by legislation and enforcement.
Journalists will need brave prosecutors and judges to hold attackers accountable if impunity is to end.
But the most important changes must come from within the media industry itself.
Because journalists’ safety directly affects news organizations’ employees, freelancers, and audiences, these organizations should report on the topic.
With attacks on the press increasing, the old approach – prideful silence – no longer makes sense.
If the journalists use their platforms to inform the world of the dangers they and their colleagues face, the world will have to listen.
Violence against journalists has historically been an issue that has remained behind the headlines.
On November 2, as the world recognizes the International Day to End Impunity for Crimes Against Journalists, let’s commit to making these stories front-page news.
Probing the Productivity Paradox
WASHINGTON, DC – Over the last decade or so, productivity growth has slowed considerably in most major developed economies, even as impressive advances have been made in areas like computing, mobile telephony, and robotics.
All of these advances ostensibly should have boosted productivity; and yet, in the United States, a world leader in technological innovation, business-sector labor productivity growth in 2004-2014 averaged less than half the rate of the previous decade.
What is going on?
One theory that has gained a lot of traction lately is that the so-called productivity paradox does not actually exist.
Productivity growth only seems to be dropping, the logic goes, because the statistics we use to measure it fail to capture fully recent gains, especially those from new and higher-quality information and communication technology (ICT).
If prices do not reflect quality improvements in the new products, price deflators are overestimated, and real output is underestimated.
Moreover, the skeptics point out, standard measures of productivity are based on GDP, which, by definition, includes only output produced.
Consumer surplus – which is growing fast, as Internet-based services like Google search and Facebook generate substantial utility to consumers, at a market price of close to zero – is ignored.
There is some logic to this argument.
Indeed, a recent review of research on productivity by the Brookings Institution and the Chumir Foundation confirmed that gains from new technologies are underestimated, owing to measurement issues relating to both product quality and consumer surplus.
But these two types of mismeasurement, the report continues, explain only a relatively small share of the slowdown in economic gains.
Furthermore, these lapses have existed for a long time, and they do not seem to have increased substantially in recent years.
The conclusion is clear: the productivity-growth slowdown is real.
Perhaps, then, we must look at the other component of the paradox: technological innovation.
Many have argued that the real issue is that recent technological innovations have been less consequential than their predecessors.
New ICT technologies, the “techno-pessimists” claim, simply do not bring the kind of economy-wide benefits that were brought by, say, the internal combustion engine and electrification.
“Techno-optimists,” for their part, believe that ICT advances do have the potential to drive rapid productivity growth; their benefits are merely subject to lags and come in waves.
What do the numbers say?
Firm-level data show that productivity growth has held up relatively well for firms that are at the technological frontier.
It is the less technologically advanced firms, which are often smaller, that have experienced the major growth slowdowns.
This suggests that the problem may not be the technology itself, but rather its slow diffusion.
There is also a macroeconomic element to the decline in productivity growth, rooted in deficient aggregate demand.
According to former US Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, when the desired level of investment is below the desired level of savings despite a nominal interest rate of zero, chronically deficient demand constrains GDP and productivity growth, producing so-called “secular stagnation.”
But, of course, demand- and supply-side arguments are inextricably linked.
And, indeed, techno-pessimist expectations, which can lower expected profits, may be discouraging investment.
Meanwhile, excessive income concentration at the top – a situation that inadequate technological diffusion may exacerbate – contributes to excess savings.
Any strategy to address the problems underpinning low productivity growth – from inadequate technological diffusion to income inequality – must address skill constraints and mismatches affecting the labor market’s ability to adjust.
As it stands, workers, particularly from lower income groups, are slow to respond to demand for new higher-level skills, owing to lags in education and training, labor-market rigidities, and perhaps also geographical factors.
These factors, together with rent capture and winner-take-all markets, can entrench inequality and blunt markets’ competitiveness.
Spurring investment is also important.
In most advanced economies and many emerging economies, investment rates fell sharply in the wake of the 2008 global financial crisis, and have still not returned to pre-crisis levels.
But innovation is often embedded in capital and needs new investment to spread across economies.
Fortunately, world leaders seem to recognize some of the imperatives they face.
At the recent G20 summit in Hangzhou, China, world leaders emphasized the need to boost investment and accelerate structural reforms to enhance productivity and lift potential growth.
One hopes that this is the first step toward an integrated approach that addresses the forces impeding technology diffusion, undermining competitiveness, and exacerbating inequality.
We cannot know how new technologies will affect the world economy in the long term.
But we know one thing: the productivity paradox is real, and it is contributing to rising inequality in many societies.
It is time to address it.
Inequality in the Twenty-First Century
MUMBAI – At the end of a low and dishonest year, reminiscent of the “low, dishonest decade” about which W.H. Auden wrote in his poem “September 1, 1939,” the world’s “clever hopes” are giving way to recognition that many severe problems must be tackled.
And, among the severest, with the gravest long-term and even existential implications, is economic inequality.
The alarming level of economic inequality globally has been well documented by prominent economists, including Thomas Piketty, François Bourguignon, Branko Milanović, and Joseph E. Stiglitz, and well-known institutions, including OXFAM and the World Bank.
And it is obvious even from a casual stroll through the streets of New York, New Delhi, Beijing, or Berlin.
Voices on the right often claim that this inequality is not only justifiable, but also appropriate: wealth is a just reward for hard work, while poverty is an earned punishment for laziness.
This is a myth.
The reality is that the poor, more often than not, must work extremely hard, often in difficult conditions, just to survive.
Moreover, if a wealthy person does have a particularly strong work ethic, it is likely attributable not just to their genetic predisposition, but also to their upbringing, including whatever privileges, values, and opportunities their background may have afforded them.
So there is no real moral argument for outsize wealth amid widespread poverty.
This is not to say that there is no justification for any amount of inequality.
After all, inequality can reflect differences in preferences: some people might consider the pursuit of material wealth more worthwhile than others.
Moreover, differential rewards do indeed create incentives for people to learn, work, and innovate, activities that promote overall growth and advance poverty reduction.
But, at a certain point, inequality becomes so severe that it has the opposite effect.
And we are far beyond that point.
Plenty of people – including many of the world’s wealthy – recognize how unacceptable severe inequality is, both morally and economically.
But if the rich speak out against it, they are often shut down and labeled hypocrites.
Apparently, the desire to lessen inequality can be considered credible or genuine only by first sacrificing one’s own wealth.
The truth, of course, is that the decision not to renounce, unilaterally, one’s wealth does not discredit a preference for a more equitable society.
To label a wealthy critic of extreme inequality as a hypocrite amounts to an ad hominem attack and a logical fallacy, intended to silence those whose voices could make a difference.
Fortunately, this tactic seems to be losing some of its potency.
It is heartening to see wealthy individuals defying these attacks, not only by openly acknowledging the economic and social damage caused by extreme inequality, but also by criticizing a system that, despite enabling them to prosper, has left too many without opportunities.
In particular, some wealthy Americans are condemning the current tax legislation being pushed by Congressional Republicans and President Donald Trump’s administration, which offers outsize cuts to the highest earners – people like them.
As Jack Bogle, the founder of Vanguard Group and a certain beneficiary of the proposed cuts, put it, the plan – which is all but guaranteed to exacerbate inequality – is a “moral abomination.”
Yet recognizing the flaws in current structures is just the beginning.
The greater challenge is to create a viable blueprint for an equitable society. (It is the absence of such a blueprint that has led so many well-meaning movements in history to end in failure.)
In this case, the focus must be on expanding profit-sharing arrangements, without stifling or centralizing market incentives that are crucial to drive growth.
A first step would be to give all of a country’s residents the right to a certain share of the economy’s profits.
This idea has been advanced in various forms by Marty Weitzman, Hillel Steiner, Richard Freeman, and, just last month, Matt Bruenig.
But it is particularly vital today, as the share of wages in national income declines, and the share of profits and rents rises – a trend that technological progress is accelerating.
There is another dimension to profit-sharing that has received little attention, related to monopolies and competition.
With modern digital technology, the returns to scale are so large that it no longer makes sense to demand that, say, 1,000 firms produce versions of the same good, each meeting one-thousandth of total demand.
A more efficient approach would have 1,000 firms each creating one part of that good.
So, when it comes to automobiles, for example, one firm would produce all of the gears, another producing all of the brake pads, and so on.
Traditional antitrust and pro-competition legislation – which began in 1890 with the Sherman Act in the US – prevents such an efficient system from taking hold.
But a monopoly of production need not mean a monopoly of income, as long as the shares in each company are widely held.
It is thus time for a radical change, one that replaces traditional anti-monopoly laws with legislation mandating a wider dispersal of shareholding within each company.
These ideas are largely untested, so much work would need to be done before they could be made operational.
But as the world lurches from one crisis to another, and inequality continues to deepen, we do not have the luxury of sticking to the status quo.
Unless we confront the inequality challenge head on, social cohesion and democracy itself will come under growing threat.
Facing the Four Structural Threats to US Democracy
BERKELEY – It has been one year since Donald Trump was elected president of the United States, and America’s democratic institutions are clearly under strain.
A mere 20% of Americans now trust the federal government to “do the right thing,” while trust in Congress has fallen below 9%.
Among congressional Republicans, in particular, a “take-no-prisoners” extremism is undermining the federal government’s capacity for action, which is precisely what many on the far right want.
According to some pessimists, the US Constitution was not designed to address the challenges of a country so sharply divided by income, race, and partisanship.
Yet state and local governments are still trusted by most voters, and they have the power under the Tenth Amendment of the US Constitution to strengthen democratic institutions.
Already, many states and cities are adopting reforms to encourage political compromise and improve democratic governance.
Better yet, some of these reforms have national implications, because they will clean up the process by which members of Congress are elected.
State and local reform movements are focused on four structural threats to democracy: gerrymandering; poorly designed primary processes; money in politics; and legislative procedures that impede compromise.
Gerrymandering, whereby state legislators redraw congressional districts to favor their own party, allows politicians to choose voters, rather than the other way around.
While the practice dates back to at least 1812, when then-Massachusetts Governor Elbridge Gerry oversaw the redrawing of his state’s senatorial districts, it has been perfected in recent decades, mainly by Republican-dominated state legislatures.
Republican-drawn districts in Texas and the six swing states of Ohio, Florida, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Virginia had a clear influence in elections to the US House of Representatives in 2016.
Now, almost all of these states’ electoral maps are being challenged as unconstitutional.
And in Gill v. Whitford, a landmark case from Wisconsin, the US Supreme Court will soon issue its first ruling in a decade on the constitutionality of gerrymandering.
Elsewhere, state governments have taken the more radical step of establishing special redistricting commissions that are independent of the two dominant political parties.
And in 24 states, voters can propose ballot initiatives to change districting rules and limit the impact of gerrymandering.
Voters in California and Arizona have already done so, and similar measures will likely be on the ballot in other states in 2018 or 2020.
But even with independently drawn districts, elections in many parts of the country will not be competitive, because voters from the same party often live in close proximity.
To address this, the political scientists T. Anthony Quinn and R. Michael Alvarez recommend reforming the primary process to “give voters more choices, which in turn can stimulate increased voter turnout.”
By opening up party primaries to more candidates, or by using ranked-choice voting (RCV) – which allows voters to list as many candidates as they want, in order of preference – we can ensure that elected officials represent the full spectrum of voters.
RCV has already been adopted by a number of American cities and the state of Maine, and one hopes it will continue to spread in the years ahead.
A third necessary reform concerns money in politics.
Ideally, we should have strict limits and transparency requirements for all political donations.
But the Supreme Court made achieving that much harder with its controversial Citizens United decision in 2010, when it held that campaign donations – even from corporations – are a protected form of free speech.
The court’s ruling not only invalidated existing campaign-finance law; it also overturned several prior Supreme Court decisions.
Not surprisingly, hidden spending by big donors has skyrocketed in the past seven years.
Ballooning undisclosed political spending and social-media advertising – by both domestic and foreign entities – has made increased transparency an urgent necessity.
With details continuing to emerge about how Russia used social media to influence the outcome of the 2016 election, a growing chorus is calling for stronger legislation to regulate online activities.
Currently, platforms such as Facebook and Twitter are not subject to the Federal Election Commission’s transparency rules.
The regulation of political spending is substantially different at the state level.
All 50 states require disclosure for contributions to campaigns for state offices, 39 states have a cap for individual contributions, and 22 states prohibit corporations from contributing to political campaigns altogether.
Furthermore, many states are exploring the possibility of making disclosure rules permanent through constitutional amendments.
And 13 states already offer a public-financing option for candidates running for state office, with many more poised to follow suit in response to grassroots pressure.
A final structural threat to American democracy is the partisan manipulation of legislative procedures.
When the majority party in either house of Congress routinely changes the rules to suit its own ends, crafting bipartisan solutions becomes almost impossible.
Similarly, at the state level, legislative supermajorities, arbitrary thresholds for passing budget and tax measures, and ballot initiatives financed by special interests can all impede bipartisan problem solving.
But as California has shown, structural barriers to good governance can be eliminated through citizen-driven reforms.
In recent years, the California legislature has cleaned up redistricting, introduced “top two primaries” and an aggressive disclosure system, reformed term limits, eliminated a supermajority rule for state budgetary measures, and improved the ballot-initiative process.
As a result, the legislature has become dramatically more effective, and its approval rating has gone from just 14% seven years ago to 57% today – its highest level since 1988.
There is little reason to believe that Congress will reform itself.
But if the movement for progressive federalism continues to gain momentum and push through meaningful state- and local-level reforms, federal lawmakers will not be able to maintain the status quo indefinitely.
With a renewed confidence in democracy, citizens can take action to ensure that elected officials are governed by the right incentives, and motivated to pursue bipartisan solutions to the country’s problems.
If California can do it, so can other states.
America’s founders created the Tenth Amendment precisely because they worried about dysfunction in the capital.
It’s time we used it.
How Federalism Can Trump Populism
BERKELEY – America remains deeply divided on many economic and political issues.
Just as US President Donald Trump was touting the accomplishments of his first 100 days in office, a federal court, responding to a legal complaint brought by several jurisdictions, temporarily blocked his executive order to strip federal funding from “sanctuary” states and cities.
According to the ruling, Trump’s order violates the Constitution’s separation of powers clause, due-process guarantees, and the Tenth Amendment, which states that, “The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.”
In other words, states and cities may cooperate with the federal government by carrying out federal policies; but the Tenth Amendment provides the constitutional basis for them to challenge or resist federal policies that conflict with their own goals (in this case, shielding undocumented immigrants from arrest and possible deportation).
Citizens’ needs vary widely across the country, and federalism helps to ensure that they are addressed.
State and municipal governments can implement policies more efficiently when they are free to source local ideas and enter into local partnerships with non-governmental actors.
Local-level pilot programs and policy experiments also accelerate innovation, with authorities able to close ineffective programs quickly and expand those that work.
And, because a federalist approach encourages transparency and accountability in how policies are implemented, it also bolsters the public’s trust in government institutions and elected officials.
This is why most Americans have maintained their confidence in state and local governments, even as their trust in the federal government has reached all-time lows.
State and municipal officials are often responsible for implementing federal policies – concerning health care, education, employment, law enforcement, and environmental protection – that directly affect people’s lives.
And the federal government, for its part, uses a variety of tools to encourage innovation among state and local governments, including waivers, pay-for-performance contracts, and challenge grants.
Waivers and state flexibility in Medicaid are at the heart of the fractious political showdown over health care.
During the past decade, many state and local governments have focused their attention on environmental policy.
In 2006, 12 states sued the Environmental Protection Agency for its failure to classify greenhouse gases as pollutants, and to regulate them accordingly.
In 2007, the Supreme Court issued a 5-4 decision, siding with the states; and in 2009, the EPA concluded that certain greenhouse gases endanger public welfare.
That finding provided a basis for the Obama administration’s new auto-emissions standards and Clean Power Plan, which were established to help America meet its commitments under the 2015 Paris climate agreement.
Trump has now signed an executive order to roll back the Clean Power Plan, claiming, ironically, that he wants to weaken federal regulations as a way to return power to the states.
Still, many states are already on track to meet the plan’s emissions targets, and have established their own standards for emissions and renewable energy, as well as their own cap-and-trade systems.
And many municipal governments have joined the fight against carbon emissions by expanding mass transit and making government buildings more energy efficient.
California is leading the way in these efforts.
It has implemented the strictest CO2 emissions standards in the US, and it is a leader in the Under U2 Coalition, a group of 170 national and subnational governments (representing 37% of the global economy) that are committed to achieving the Paris agreement’s emissions targets.
In addition to pursuing their own environmental policies, state and local governments can also resist or undermine federal policies.
For starters, they can simply abstain from taking action, as we have seen with some states’ reaction to federal education reforms.
Or they can withhold the state-level resources needed to enforce federal laws, as states that have decriminalized marijuana have done, and as sanctuary states and cities are now doing.
The immigration showdown will ultimately be adjudicated in the court system; and Trump has already lost his first battles there.
Under federalism – whether cooperative or “uncooperative” – it is often assumed that state and local governments are pursuing the same goals.
In fact, there is a deep divide between left-leaning “blue” cities and the right-leaning “red” states where many are located.
And there are many ways that state governments can thwart progressive federalism at the municipal level. Cities, for their part, often lack the information and resources necessary for developing and implementing effective policies.
A number of organizations have now emerged to strengthen the policy-making capacity of city governments including Michael Bloomberg’s Government Innovation Program, Fuse Corps, Results for America, Social Finance, Third Sector Capital Partners, and USAFacts.
There have been several legal fights recently between city governments and state legislatures over the principle of preemption, which holds that state laws override local laws.
According to Preemption Watch, in 2016 alone, at least 36 state governments – most of them Republican-led – preempted cities by introducing laws on a wide range of issues, from minimum wage to environmental protection, gun control, fracking, immigration, and anti-discrimination ordinances.
And 42 states have set limits on the taxes and expenditures of their cities.
The political struggle between red states and blue cities will continue to play out in judicial and legislative battles, while giving rise to new citizen-led initiatives.
A new movement of grassroots progressive federalism, reflecting the powers conferred on citizens by the Tenth Amendment, has already begun to emerge.
It is apparent in huge citizen marches, and in coordinated civil-society initiatives advocating for a national popular vote, congressional redistricting, automatic voter registration, and a higher minimum wage.
Trump did not accomplish much in his first 100 days.
But he did unwittingly remind many Americans that the US Constitution delegates substantial political authority to states, cities, and individual citizens.
And his administration has only further highlighted the importance of an independent judiciary, where the coming years’ battles among local, state, and federal government entities will be fought.
The Public Sphere’s New Enemies
NEW YORK – Before November’s terrorist attacks in Paris, it was legal to stage a demonstration in a public square in that city.
Now it isn’t.
In Uganda, although citizens campaigning against corruption or in favor of gay rights often faced a hostile public, they didn’t face jail time for demonstrating.
But under a frighteningly vague new statute, now they do.
In Egypt, government authorities recently raided and shut down prominent cultural institutions – an art gallery, a theater, and a publishing house – where artists and activists once gathered.
All around the world, it seems, the walls are closing in on the space that people need to assemble, associate, express themselves freely, and register dissent.
Even as the Internet and communications technology have made speaking up publicly technically easier than ever, ubiquitous state and commercial surveillance has ensured that expression, association, and protest remain constrained.
In short, speaking up has never required more courage.
For me, this shift could not hit closer to home.
In November, the Open Society Foundations (the global philanthropies of George Soros, which I lead) became the second organization blacklisted under a Russian law, enacted in May, that allows the country’s prosecutor general to ban foreign organizations and suspend their financial support of local activists.
Because anyone who engages with us is subject to possible prosecution and imprisonment, we have had no choice but to cut off relations with the dozens of Russian citizens we supported in their efforts to preserve some fragment of democracy in their country.
Of course, there is nothing wrong with regulating public space and the organizations that use it.
In the early 1990s, some new governments in Eastern Europe, Africa, and Latin America, underestimating the power of an active citizenry and civil society, failed to regulate adequately advocacy organizations and the space in which they work.
But over the last two decades, as active citizens have toppled regimes in dozens of countries, governments have moved too far in the opposite direction, imposing excessive regulations on those organizations and that space.
In the process, they are criminalizing the most basic forms of democratic practice.
In some cases, governments do not even bother to create a legal precedent for their actions.
Last spring in Burundi, President Pierre Nkurunziza assumed a third term in office, despite the two-term limit enshrined in the constitution.
When citizens took to the streets to protest, they were violently suppressed.
Even countries with some of the world’s most robust democratic traditions have been cracking down.
After the Paris attacks, France and Belgium (where the plot was planned and organized) suspended civil liberties indefinitely, transforming themselves overnight into what are, at least by statute, police states.
In both countries, demonstrations have been banned; places of worship have been closed; and hundreds of people have been detained and interrogated for having voiced an unconventional opinion.
This approach is exacting a heavy toll.
Thousands of people who had planned to protest at the United Nations climate talks last month had to settle for leaving their shoes.
It was a startling image, illustrating how fear can overrun the commitments needed to maintain open societies and political freedoms even in Europe, the birthplace of modern citizenship.
There is no simple formula for regulating public space or safeguarding peaceful political dissent in an age of terrorism and globalization.
But two basic principles are clear.
First, the world needs stronger international governance of the movement of people and money, and fewer restrictions on speech, association, and dissent.
Lately, governments have been moving in the wrong direction.
But 2016 offers plenty of opportunities for correction, in areas ranging from trade to migration.
Second, non-profit organizations working to improve public policy need the same rights to secure international funding as for-profit entrepreneurs seeking to provide goods and services.
Foreign direct investment should be encouraged, not hindered, regardless of whether it will support goods production and job creation or stronger public policies and more active citizenship.
The responsibility for changing course does not fall exclusively on governments.
All of us who value open public space must stand shoulder to shoulder in support of the policy frameworks and institutions that safeguard it.
Now is a time for solidarity across movements, causes, and countries.
When simply taking up the activism of a concerned citizen can land you in jail and fear of surveillance encourages mass passivity, single-issue politics is not a winning strategy.
The best way to defend public space is to occupy it, even if you are championing a cause different from that of the person standing next to you.
In 2016, we must fill – and thus protect – that space together.
PROMESA’s Dangerous Premises
NEW YORK – Puerto Rico’s economy is in deep trouble.
More than a decade of recession has made the public debt unsustainable and is fueling migration outflows to the United States mainland, affecting the lives of thousands of families and imposing a higher burden on those who stay.
Reversing this destabilizing dynamic will require a debt restructuring that provides the relief needed to implement pro-growth policies.
Unfortunately, what is being offered isn’t nearly enough.
Puerto Rico’s debt is to be restructured under a framework established by the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act (PROMESA).
That federal law, enacted in June 2016, also established an Oversight Board with fiscal decision-making authority for the US commonwealth.
The restructuring process started on May 3, when the Board filed a petition in federal court.
But many crucial decisions have yet to be taken, such as how much overall debt relief will be provided, and how the “haircut” will be distributed among holders of different types of bonds.
These decisions will determine which policies are feasible to boost Puerto Rico’s economic prospects – and thus how much it can pay its creditors.
At the center of any effort to resolve the debt crisis must be the understanding that just as today’s debt restructuring affects Puerto Rico’s future growth, Puerto Rico’s future growth affects how much debt restructuring is needed.
Yet the ten-year fiscal plan approved by the Board for the 2017-2026 period – which inevitably will form the basis of debt-restructuring discussions – seems to ignore this circularity.
The plan itself recognizes that its adoption implies another “lost decade” of economic activity and will weaken the island’s debt sustainability, thus perpetuating a crisis that all parties would like to end .
Unfortunately, the Board’s already-deep projected fall in real GNP is highly optimistic, because it relies on a number of implausible and/or controversial assumptions.
Five flaws in the Board’s fiscal plan stand out.
First, the projected fiscal multipliers – the amount by which GNP will fall as a result of each dollar of fiscal contraction – used for the GNP forecast assume that a contraction of one dollar in the primary fiscal deficit will be associated with a $1.34 contraction of GNP.
That value lies on the lower end of the range of estimated fiscal multipliers for countries or regions experiencing recessions.
The value of fiscal multipliers depends on how the economy is performing.
Point estimates of multipliers associated with non-defense spending for regions or countries in recessions range from 1.09 to 3.5.
And, because Puerto Rico is not in any ordinary recession, it is not enough (or even appropriate) to analyze what to expect in the best-case scenario.
A proper assessment of the consequences of the fiscal policies demanded by the plan should focus not on a single value, but on a range of values based on plausible scenarios from an optimistic to a pessimistic bound.
For example, simply using a multiplier of 2.0 and maintaining all of the plan’s other (unrealistic) assumptions causes a 9.4% projected cumulative fall in real GNP during fiscal years 2018 and 2019, compared to the fiscal plan’s estimate of 7.2%.
A second flaw is that the plan’s GNP projections ignore the endogenous feedback effects that declining economic activity will have on fiscal revenues.
A reduction in public spending that depresses economic activity also reduces the tax base.
Thus, the government would need to do more than what the plan foresees to achieve the revenue targets.
Third, whereas the plan’s contractionary policies push the economy below the Board’s baseline GNP estimates, a number of structural reforms, mostly meant to affect aggregate supply, allegedly push it above.
Indeed, these reforms seem to be the only force driving the (nominal) recovery that the plan projects after 2022.
But this simply is not credible.
Puerto Rico’s economy is in a demand-constrained regime, and there is no reason to expect this to change in the foreseeable future.
Thus, economic recovery in the short term requires aggressive government stimulus, particularly given that any structural reform that reduces spending (such as a decrease in pensions) will be more likely to have a contractionary effect in an economy that is demand-constrained.
Other measures, such as cutting funding for public education, are likely to reduce demand now and lower aggregate supply over the long run.
Fourth, the plan’s assumption about outward migration is controversial at best.
Puerto Rico’s population has declined from approximately 3.8 million in 2000 to a little more than 3.4 million in 2016.
Between 2010 and 2016, the annual rate of population contraction exceeded 1%, and reached 1.8% in 2016.
A deeper recession – as anticipated by the Board’s plan – will further decrease opportunities in the island, fueling more migration to the mainland.
And yet the plan assumes that the migration flows will taper off, with the population declining by only 0.2% per year over the 2017-2026 period.
Given the destabilizing dynamics that the fiscal plan will trigger, out-migration will be higher than the plan assumes, the size of the economy will shrink, and the per capita debt burden on those remaining will increase.
Finally, instead of specifying a comprehensive debt-restructuring proposal, the plan simply specifies the amount that will be repaid to creditors during the next decade.
But future macroeconomic dynamics cannot be assessed without an estimate of the debt relief that will be provided.
Indeed, the lack of a restructuring plan heightens uncertainty and thus impedes the investment needed to restore economic growth.
Filing for what is essentially bankruptcy was a sensible move.
Otherwise, Puerto Rico would have been exposed to massive litigation that would have undermined restructuring efforts and lengthened the road to economic recovery.
But what the plan should have done is to define the policies Puerto Rico needs to recover, and simultaneously present a restructuring proposal that grants enough relief to make those policies feasible.
Instead, by approving the 2017-2026 fiscal plan, the PROMESA Oversight Board put itself in a difficult position.
Using that plan as the basis for calculating Puerto Rico’s relief needs risks leading to the flawed conclusion that Puerto Rico can manage a recovery with a much smaller haircut than it needs.
Unless the plan is urgently redefined on the basis of credible assumptions, Puerto Rico will not recover, debt sustainability will not be restored, and the Board will have failed in its mission.
What Puerto Rico Needs
WASHINGTON, DC – President Donald Trump and the US Congress are coming under mounting pressure to increase assistance to Puerto Rico.
The devastation caused there last week by Hurricane Maria has only exacerbated severe longer-term problems resulting from deferred maintenance on the island’s critical infrastructure.
Puerto Rico needs more than short-term assistance (although this is also urgent); it needs bipartisan support to rebuild, with an initial and essential focus on a more robust and cheaper supply of electricity.
The existing electricity grid has substantially collapsed, with the Federal Emergency Management Administration (FEMA) estimating that up to 90% of the transmission system may have been destroyed by the hurricane.
A major dam is at risk.
Damage to the air traffic control infrastructure has severely limited flights to and from the island.
As Governor Ricardo Rosselló has stated publicly, there is now a real risk of a major humanitarian disaster.
Donations are flowing in, but the total will be small relative to what is needed.
The Trump administration says that FEMA is working hard and effectively.
Let’s hope they are right.
There will be a lot of questions about whether Puerto Rico’s roughly 3.4 million US citizens receive the same support as Texas and Florida (and other parts of the 50 states) when natural disaster strikes.
But the bigger question is this: What will be done – and by whom – to help Puerto Rico really recover?
Puerto Rico – a dependent territory of the US – needs major investment in its essential infrastructure to bring it at least to the level of the 50 states.
After the humanitarian situation is stabilized, policymakers should focus on providing Puerto Rico with stable, reliable, and cost-effective electric power, generated primarily by renewables and distributed over a smart, resilient grid.
Ensuring energy availability will be indispensable for stability and sustained economic growth.
Merely propping up aging infrastructure will not be effective.
Cheaper and more resilient electricity benefits everyone – from the sidewalk vendor to the most sophisticated pharmaceutical operation.
And all the technology needed to provide it is available in the US today.
Ironically, the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA), the bankrupt incumbent energy provider, has been effective primarily in building its own competition.
Electricity prices on the island are higher than anywhere else in the US (except Hawaii), and service is unreliable.
As a result, an ever-growing number of customers have shunned PREPA’s offerings, relying instead on their own diesel-powered generators.
Noel Zamot, who serves as Revitalization Coordinator under the Financial Oversight and Management Board for Puerto Rico, has suggested that a smart, resilient grid would be designed from the ground up, and would rely on distributed generation to mitigate the impact of future natural disasters or human attacks.
Smaller, more agile power-generation units would be linked to a sophisticated monitoring and control system to ensure immediate startup and generation following outages.
Moreover, at least 50% of all energy could come from renewables (solar, wind, tidal, and more), including through the use of advanced storage technologies, some of which are currently under development.
The bulk of long-haul transmission lines would be shielded or buried, and an information strategy that deploys sensors appropriately would detect losses, whatever their source.
Such a grid would stabilize costs for existing businesses, likely reducing the single biggest cost for most small and medium-size enterprises.
And it would create conditions for truly innovative future scenarios.
Imagine Puerto Rico becoming the electric vehicle capital of the world, with well-apportioned recharging stations, near-zero emissions, and car sharing for the tourism sector.
Puerto Rico could even become an energy exporter, supplying excess capacity to nearby neighbors in the US and British Virgin Islands.
All of this (with the exception of large-scale storage for renewables) is achievable with existing technology.
The key issues are strategic, organizational, and regulatory.
With government support, and an understanding of the proper governance structure and processes for effective regulation, this vision could be executed within the coming decade.
And building this grid would generate plenty of good jobs.
The federal government’s role should be to make Puerto Rico a hub for investing in clean, renewable energy that is resilient to weather shocks.
New technology that results from this investment could be commercialized and sold to a world that is struggling to adapt to climate change and extreme weather.
The Trump administration would have trouble passing such a package of long-run investment through Congress with only Republican support; various ideological objections would no doubt be raised.
But this is a perfect opportunity for Trump to reach out to the Democrats, and to demonstrate that both sides can cooperate on rebuilding and updating essential national infrastructure.
The Last Silovik?
MOSCOW – President Vladimir Putin’s regime is as sphinxlike as any that has ever ruled Russia, and now there is a new mystery afoot.
Is Igor Sechin – perhaps the most powerful of the St. Petersburg siloviki who helped establish Putin’s regime 18 years ago – about to fall?
The siloviki, the grey men who emerged from the security and military apparatus, have ruled the roost in Russia for the last generation.
Sechin had a more substantial KGB career than Putin himself, and has held many of the key posts in his patron’s administration.
Since 2012, he has been CEO of the state-owned oil giant Rosneft, Russia’s third-largest company (after Gazprom and Lukoil), whose board chairman since September is former German Chancellor Gerhard Schröder.
Under Sechin’s leadership, Rosneft has become a state within a state, with a quarter-million employees, $65 billion in revenue, and 50 subsidiaries at home and abroad – as many as Gazprom.
And Rosneft, even more than Gazprom, has pioneered the modus operandi of the Putin system since 2004, when it took over the assets of Yukos, following the imprisonment of the company’s head, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, a Putin opponent, on fraud and embezzlement charges.
Sechin has always had a direct line to Putin.
Many Russians have long assumed that he is also the eyes and ears of the KGB’s successor, the Federal Security Service (FSB), in the natural-resource sector, which forms the core of Russia’s economy and is the hub of the country’s corrupt power networks.
Yet, today, Sechin is involved in a very public – and symbolically significant – courtroom fight.
He has been summoned three times by a Moscow criminal court to testify in a case against Alexei Ulyukaev, a former minister of economic development.
But Sechin has consistently failed to appear, with his office recently telling the court that he wouldn’t be available until next year.
Sechin’s excuses for not showing up have been pretty standard: the summons was lost, and his schedule – which included big government trips to Vietnam and Turkey – did not allow it.
But there is nothing standard about a Russian court ordering a figure of Sechin’s stature to testify publicly.
On the contrary, in the world of Kremlin politics, the move is as bizarre as it gets.
It all began a year ago, when Ulyukaev was detained at Rosneft’s Moscow headquarters, where he was allegedly attempting to secure a $2 million bribe from Sechin, in exchange for his support for Rosneft’s planned acquisition of a majority of state shares in Bashneft, a regional oil company.
Sechin had, after a previous conversation on the topic, reported Ulyukaev to the FSB, who were waiting to take the minister into custody.
Yet bribery is how Russia operates, so the decision to pursue a bribery case against a powerful player is never just about the rule of law.
In this case, the real motivation behind Sechin’s decision to go after Ulyukaev is uncertain.
Perhaps he felt that the minister needed reminding of his place in the rigid Kremlin hierarchy.
Or perhaps, as has been rumored, Ulyukaev was working with other officials to rein in Sechin by stopping Rosneft from acquiring the Bashneft shares.
In any case, Sechin’s plan – about which Putin may well have known nothing – soon backfired, as the legal proceedings became public.
Particularly damning, transcripts of Sechin’s secret recordings of his conversation with Ulyukaev – part of a sting operation in which Sechin played a leading role – were disclosed in September.
Sechin called the court’s decision to open the case to the public “professional cretinism.”
He claims that “cases like this should be closed from all sides,” because “they contain state secrets.”
But the truth is that Sechin was both arrogant and a fool to assume that he would not get dragged into the case.
Of course, given Sechin’s role in entrapping Ulyukaev, logic dictates that he should have been the first witness called.
But, in Russia, powerful or famous figures – such as, for example, Khodorkovsky – do not become embroiled in legal cases without the Kremlin’s explicit approval.
No low-level Moscow court judge or prosecutor could possibly have summoned Sechin unilaterally.
So when Sechin was called as the last witness – unlucky number 13 – there was only one logical conclusion: Putin, who has already ousted a number of the leading siloviki who brought him to power, had decided to take Sechin down a peg or two.
The gray cardinal of Rosneft had stepped too far out of line.
As in the Khodorkovsky case, the Kremlin seems to be using the courtroom as a platform for clarifying the positions of the Russian elite.
This is particularly important in the run-up to the 2018 presidential election, not least because it is rumored that Putin is seeking a trusted flunky to take over his post, at least temporarily.
Even if Putin does run again – the more likely outcome, given his penchant for total control – he will be seeking a subservient prime minister.
The current one, Dmitri Medvedev, has been discredited as inefficient and – to a public that views him as a political pygmy – unworthy of the level of personal corruption that has been exposed.
By going after one of Putin’s ministers, Sechin appeared to be flexing his muscles, perhaps believing that this would prove his readiness as a prime-time political player.
Instead, the episode has merely shown, yet again, that there is no real “number two” in Russia; there is only Putin, controlling the FSB, the courts, and the commanding heights of the economy.
Whether Putin decides to remain president or temporarily to fill the post with a puppet, as he did in 2008 with Medvedev, his message could not be clearer: I, and only I, am in charge.
Is Vladimir Putin Losing His Grip?
MOSCOW – In 1984, just before Mikhail Gorbachev’s ascent to power, there was a sense in Moscow that the Soviet Union was petrified, and nothing could change.
Then everything did change, exposing the extent of the transformation that had occurred beneath the surface.
Today, a similar mood pervades Moscow, with President Vladimir Putin’s regime appearing stable, even unbreachable.
But, as was the case back then, a closer look reveals a number of chinks in the armor.
In many ways, Russia has been moving backward in recent decades.
In the 1990s, Russia was a freewheeling place, where virtually everything was allowed.
Moscow had 20 daily newspapers, with views ranging from liberal to Stalinist.
Today, Russian civil society is severely stifled, and to watch television in Moscow is to find 20 channels controlled by the Kremlin.
In 1991, Boris Yeltsin, in one of his first actions as President, broke up the old KGB into several agencies, cut its staff by half, and slashed its budget.
Today, the KGB’s successor, the Federal Security Service (FSB), has seized complete control over Russia’s security apparatus, including by arresting high-level generals in other law-enforcement agencies.
The result is a single security service that is more powerful than at any time since Stalin – and viewed as independent from the Kremlin.
On the economic front, too, Russia has backtracked.
In 2003, Russia’s private sector produced 70% of the country’s GDP.
Today, the state sector generates most of the country’s output, squeezing out small and medium-size enterprises, and five big state banks dominate the financial market.
Moreover, Putin’s policy of “de-offshoring” has imposed such cumbersome controls on the business leaders of the 1990s that most have sold off their assets in Russia and decamped to London or Monaco.
This trend has been accelerated by Russia’s lack of any real property rights, which has enabled the Kremlin to cut Russia’s wealthy down to size at will, often targeting the most law-abiding among them.
Small wonder that forecasts for annual GDP growth are stuck at 1.5-2%.
The regime wants to change this pattern.
In May 2016, Putin asked three expert groups to recommend economic-reform programs: a liberal group led by former Finance Minister Alexei Kudrin; a technocratic group led by Economy Minister Maxim Oreshkin; and the more statist Stolypin Club led by Putin’s business ombudsman Boris Titov.
Each group has delivered thousands of pages of expert reports.
But any shift toward respecting the rule of law would be incompatible with the kleptocratic character of Putin’s regime, implying that genuine reform is out of the question.
The mandate given to the three groups thus appears to have been little more than therapy for social scientists, a way to keep them busy – and out of the opposition.
Far from embracing change, Putin will seek a fourth term in next year’s presidential election – a race he will surely win, given the Kremlin’s control over the media and the courts.
But, to render his victory credible, Putin needs Russia’s dispirited population to show up to vote.
It is rumored that Sergei Kiriyenko, the Kremlin’s first deputy chief of staff, is targeting 70% turnout, with 70% of those votes going to Putin.
That won’t be easy to achieve.
In the State Duma elections in September 2016, only 47.8% of registered voters turned out.
In local elections last month, even fewer bothered to participate, with Vladivostok reporting just 13% turnout.
If voters are going to show up for next year’s presidential election, they will need to believe that real change is possible.
Putin needs a credible rival, not the same old Kremlin-linked candidates – the communist Gennady Zyuganov, the nationalist buffoon Vladimir Zhirinovsky, and the purported liberal Grigory Yavlinsky – to join the race.
The socialite Ksenia Sobchak, who announced her candidacy after meeting with Putin, may seem able to inject some life into the campaign.
But there is only one real option to secure a large voter turnout: the anti-corruption campaigner and vocal Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny.
In September 2013, when Navalny ran for mayor of Moscow, he received 27% of the vote.
But the independent pollster Levada Center reckons that, despite strong support for Navalny in Moscow, he would not obtain more votes today.
Given this, some Kremlin advisers want to let Navalny run, while keeping him off national television.
And it seems that the Kremlin may be considering just that, as it has allowed Navalny to hold large campaign meetings with up to 10,000 people in 100 cities.
But others in Putin’s inner circle would prefer to lock up Navalny for the fourth time this year – no surprise, given his proven capacity to disrupt the Kremlin’s authority.
Last March, for example, Navalny produced a 50-minute documentary on corruption, revealing that Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev had used $1.3 billion in bribes to purchase six palaces and two vineyards.
The film, watched on YouTube by some 25 million people, effectively killed Medvedev’s political career.
Now, Putin will need to consider who should succeed Medvedev.
In the past, he has usually installed a loyal non-entity in that position, and he has many possible candidates, such as the remarkably ineffective Gazprom Chairman Alexei Miller.
The question is whether the next prime minister will be more closely allied with Putin or the FSB.
The United States may play an unexpected role in this drama.
The recently enacted Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, which calls for a report on Russian “oligarchs and parastatal entities” within 180 days, offers the US a unique opportunity to influence the Kremlin before the presidential election.
Many of Russia’s wealthy have already fled Russia in fear of the FSB.
Now, Russia may see another wave of departures, with those close to the Kremlin fearing that Putin can no longer protect them.
Putin may be guaranteed another presidential term, but a regime that cannot satisfy even its rulers is hardly sustainable.
The History of Russia’s Future
MOSCOW – Strategic vision has never been a Russian attribute, and it certainly was absent in 2012.
Russia’s vast territory continually seems to obscure for its leaders the need to plan for the future, while its seemingly infinite supply of natural resources convinces them that the country can handle any contingency.
As a result, Russia is perpetually unprepared for the future.
Indeed, just as its leaders failed to prepare for the fall of communism, the softening of the Russian economy shows that they are poorly equipped for the coming decades, which will be characterized by depleted resources, a declining population, and shrinking territory.
Vladimir Putin’s return to the presidency this year marked a new low for Russian strategic vision.
After all, the past is the only future that Putin has ever wanted for the country.
When the Soviet Union collapsed, the Kremlin lost not only control of vast portions of territory, but also half of the USSR’s nearly 300 million people.
Since then, the population has fallen by millions more, owing to Russia’s high mortality rate, especially among men.
Over the same period, the population of the United States has grown from 248 million to more than 300 million.
Despite calls by the Russian public for reform – from modernization of the military and decrepit and corrupt legal institutions to diversification of the economy beyond natural-resource extraction and the military-industrial complex – Putin has stuck to his autocratic guns.
When Defense Minister Anatoly Serdyukov tried to reform Russia’s armed forces – by expanding the military’s training in modern defense techniques, cutting costs, and boosting efficiency – he was replaced by Sergei Shoigu, Moscow’s former governor and a die-hard Putin loyalist, who restored the outdated system.
Even the army’s new uniforms, which border on the comic with their eighteenth-century epaulets and World War II jackets, invoke the past, rather than provide the comfort and efficiency needed in modern warfare.
More ominously, in a move reminiscent of Stalin, Putin has initiated a new anti-extremism law, according to which anyone can be accused of terrorism, espionage, being a foreign agent, or disseminating hatred.
The law has proven to be a powerful tool in stifling dissent, which can include mass protests against election fraud, journalists working to expose corruption, or a librarian in Siberia fulfilling a patron’s request for a banned book.
Likewise, Putin’s foreign policy remains mired in old Russian obsessions, beginning with restoring the empire in whatever form possible.
In his effort to prove that losing its imperial status has not diminished Russia’s global role, Putin has meddled relentlessly in international decisions, opposing sanctions against Iran and supporting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s regime, even as it slaughters its own citizens.
Furthermore, while Russia has finally joined the World Trade Organization, doubts about the country’s human-rights record persist.
In 2009, for example, Sergei Magnitsky, a lawyer, was accused of embezzlement after uncovering a fraudulent tax-refund scheme run by Russian officials.
He died in prison after he was badly beaten and denied medical treatment.
In response, the US Congress has just enacted the Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law Accountability Act, which prohibits anyone implicated in Magnitsky’s detention or death – or others suspected of gross human-rights abuses – from entering the US or using its banking system.
Similar laws have been adopted in Canada and across Western Europe.
But, instead of admitting the crime and working to bring the perpetrators to justice, Russia’s leaders have fought back, declaring that certain Europeans and Americans will, in turn, be barred from visiting Russia.
Putin’s unwillingness to heed popular discontent, and his failure to develop relations with the West during his 12 years in power, has backed him into a corner – and he is running out of ideas.
In his most recent attempt to restore Russia’s empire, he announced the creation of the Eurasian Economic Union with Belarus and Kazakhstan.
(Putin is courting the other ex-Soviet Central Asian countries, as well as Ukraine and Georgia).
But, even here, the President is bullying the very leaders he seeks to woo.
Given that Ukraine’s participation would significantly enhance the union’s legitimacy, Russia is using all available tactics – from lower gas prices to trade sanctions – to persuade its leaders to join.
But Ukraine’s President Viktor Yanukovych, who nurtures his own thuggish reputation, wants no part of it.
Putin’s effort to unify the ex-Soviet states is hardly the only initiative that exemplifies his flawed vision.
In order to appeal to the leaders of East Asia’s fast-growing economies – which Putin has called the most important factor for Russia’s long-term success – the government spent billions of dollars this year to modernize the dilapidated port of Vladivostok.
But, given that Asian leaders view Russia as little more than a natural-resource milk cow, it is far from clear that the investment will pay off, particularly given the absence of a comprehensive economic-development plan for the region.
Putin hopes that harsh policies, at home and abroad, will allow him to maintain a stranglehold on Russia.
But they have merely ensured the country’s decline.
As 2013 begins, Russia is back on the hamster wheel of history, treating the past as prologue – and thus wasting its resources and blighting its people’s lives.
What’s Wrong With Executive Compensation?
LONDON – It’s annual general meeting (AGM) season for public companies around the world, and, as in previous years, one issue has been moving company news from the business section to the front page: executive pay.
Companies continue to announce compensation packages for their top managers that leave people agape, not just because the gap between companies’ highest- and lowest-paid workers is so wide, but also because the compensation bears so little relation to firms’ performance.
Nonetheless, a concerted pushback has begun, led by a group that companies and their boards might actually pay attention to: their largest and most influential investors.
Hedge funds, pension funds, and sovereign wealth funds are stating that they are looking closely at C-suite remuneration, and that it is time to take reform seriously.
Norway’s sovereign wealth fund, worth $870 billion, has said that it is setting its sights on pay structures.
Aberdeen Asset Management and Royal London Asset Management were among a group of shareholders who strongly objected to BP’s proposed 20% increase in compensation for CEO Bob Dudley in a year when BP made record losses, and they joined 59% of investors in rejecting the package.
Though the BP vote was non-binding, it was a clear signal to the company and its board.
Similarly, 54% of Renault SA’s shareholders, which include the French state, opposed CEO Carlos Ghosn’s €25 million ($28 million) remuneration package at the company’s AGM in April.
It, too, was a non-binding vote, and the board chose to disregard it.
But ignoring shareholder sentiment is becoming untenable.
Discontent cuts across all sectors, from banking, with calls for a review at Lloyds Bank, to media and advertising, with an outcry, yet again, about the pay awarded to WPP’s Martin Sorrell; at £70.4 million, his latest package makes him the United Kingdom’s highest-paid CEO.
At Berkshire Hathaway’s AGM in April, Warren Buffett advocated for compensation plans that fit the needs of the business, rather than vice versa.
This happens when a “very greedy chief executive…designs a pyramid so that a whole bunch of other people down the line get overpaid… just so it doesn’t look like he’s all by himself, in terms of that fantastic pay-off he’s arranged for himself.”
Part of the issue is that executive remuneration packages have become too complex.
Gone are the days when CEOs did the job and were paid a wage.
It is almost as if remuneration committees have taken a leaf from Sun Tzu's The Art of War: “The whole secret lies in confusing the enemy, so that he cannot fathom our real intent.”
Explanations for remuneration calculations can run for pages, and often board members who aren’t on the remuneration committee cannot unravel them.
Moreover, bonus targets are fundamentally flawed.
Markets are fraught with “unknown unknowns.”
Boards often don’t know now what will need to happen later.
And that means goals based on the past or the supposed future reward what we currently think rather than actual performance.
When pay is driven by strict adherence to targets set 12 months before, CEOs look back, instead of focusing on the present and on what comes next.
Compensation needs to reflect whether the CEO won all the battles but lost the war.
But avoiding what might be called the “Dudley Paradox” – a CEO is paid a huge bonus for hitting targets, even as the company suffers major losses – requires boards to stop delegating the entire pay discussion to the compensation committee and waiting for the decisions to arrive, fait accompli, tied up in a bow.
The full board should review the company’s operations and strategy thoroughly; only then should the compensation committee set about creating the program to act on it.
Having such a program in place is especially important when a new CEO or senior executive is hired.
At a time of great hope and a desire to woo the candidate, desperation or enthusiasm can lead to poor judgment and badly formulated packages, which, once negotiated, are not subject to shareholder vote.
A prime example is Yahoo’s firing of Henrique De Castro in 2014.
After only 15 months on the job as COO, De Castro walked away with $109 million.
Lastly, CEOs should show leadership in how they manage their own compensation negotiations.
If they are responsible for all aspects of the company, then they cannot abdicate responsibility with a “Because I’m worth it” attitude when news of their large pay packages becomes public.
More important, they need to recognize that no law obliges them to take what they can get.
They could hit the targets and earn the pay, but look at the company’s results and choose to adjust the total accordingly.
The CEO needs to be talking about the business of the company to its workforce, investors, and the wider world, not be stuck at the AGM defending the executive team’s salaries.
The revolt against large pay packages won’t go away.
For all the reported cases, many more are simmering beneath the surface of public scrutiny.
Unless these companies address head-on the quiet hand-wringing among board members and grumbling among investors, they will find themselves on the front pages next.
Can Ramaphosa Fix South Africa?
WASHINGTON, DC – Cyril Ramaphosa’s victory in December’s contest to lead South Africa’s ruling African National Congress (ANC) was a resounding repudiation of President Jacob Zuma.
Ramaphosa will now almost certainly be elected South Africa’s president in 2019 – if not before.
He has promised to stimulate the country’s moribund economy and implement a wide-ranging anti-corruption agenda.
The key question, however, is how much impact change at the top will have on South Africa’s troubled democracy.
Ramaphosa is unlikely to be a miracle worker.
First, he faces the challenge of reforming his own party.
The ANC’s identity as the party that liberated South Africa from the scourge of apartheid in 1994 has delivered it every election since.
Yet today the ANC stands accused of both fecklessness and moral decay, and it suffered unprecedented losses to the opposition Democratic Alliance in urban areas in local elections in 2016.
Disillusioned ANC members can be strong allies for Ramaphosa’s reform attempts; they were powerful enough to elect him over Zuma’s preferred candidate, his ex-wife and former African Union Commission chair Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma.
But, as in many countries, from Iran to Russia, young urban voters pushing for change run up against older rural voters, the core of the ANC’s base.
These voters are unlikely to turn against the party, thus buffering any existential threat to its dominance at the ballot box and putting a damper on reform efforts.
The larger challenge facing Ramaphosa comes from the state itself.
He must tackle the structural decay fostered under Zuma.
South Africa’s networks of patronage and corruption have become so endemic that the term “state capture” – coined by the World Bank to describe central Asian post-Soviet states where oligarchs coopted public institutions for personal profit – has entered widespread use.
South Africa’s state capture is deeply embedded.
The country is a democracy, for all its flaws, with complex institutions.
Unlike in a tightly controlled dictatorship, cutting off the head will not kill the monster.
In order to coopt so many interests, Zuma’s tentacular patronage networks must reach through many layers of bureaucracy and business hierarchies.
Dissolving this lucrative conglomeration at a time when the economy has little else to offer multitudes of civil servants and workers – unemployment currently stands at almost 28% – will be difficult and unpopular.
Moreover, Zuma is weakened but not gone.
Ramaphosa won the leadership contest by a slim margin, and his elected deputy, David Mabuza, and ANC secretary-general, Ace Magashule, are Zuma acolytes.
Zuma’s faction has also notionally retained control of the ANC’s 86-member National Executive Committee.
Although some members’ allegiances now appear to be in flux, the NEC was vital in shielding Zuma from previous attempts to remove him.
Finally, Ramaphosa himself may well be conflicted.
As a key architect of the deal that ended the apartheid regime, he proved himself to be a formidable negotiator.
He was tipped to be Nelson Mandela’s deputy when Mandela became South Africa’s first post-apartheid president, but he stepped aside when asked, demonstrating pragmatism and patience.
But he is also very much a product of the ANC system.
His large fortune was tantamount to a gift from the ANC’s Black Economic Empowerment programs in the 1990s.
While he is viewed as clean despite his lavish lifestyle, he has certainly benefited from ANC patronage.
Assuming Ramaphosa has the determination, political savvy, and support to drive sweeping change, he will not be alone.
Some of South Africa’s institutions – including the judiciary and the public protector – have proven resilient in the face of immense pressure to capitulate to Zuma’s agenda.
On December 29, the Constitutional Court delivered a shot in the arm to those who want to see Zuma removed before the end of his term in 2019.
The court ruled that Parliament had failed to hold the president accountable in a scandal concerning diverted state funds.
The judges demanded the National Assembly consider impeachment.
The courts’ moral stature makes them an important ally in efforts to clean up South African politics.
But impeachment, a lengthy and fraught process, would be unlikely to lead to Zuma’s removal much before the end of his term.
The other path to consolidate Ramaphosa’s position is a no-confidence vote within the NEC.
But, in a clear sign of his current weakness, Zuma was able to keep a no-confidence motion off the NEC agenda earlier this month, only by making a major concession: permitting an inquiry into state capture that he had been blocking for more than a year.
His own links with the scandal-plagued Gupta family will feature prominently.
The ANC’s national executive committee has debated establishing a process to secure Zuma’s resignation, which Ramaphosa supporters want within weeks.
But no timeline has yet been specified.
Given Zuma’s political acumen, he could well prolong the process for many months.
Nonetheless, his days are numbered.
Ramaphosa, for his part, has cautioned that Zuma should never be humiliated.
His acknowledgement that power within the ANC is “a very delicate matter” is telling.
He understands all too clearly the constraints he faces.
The international community can play a role in supporting Ramaphosa.
The classic scenario is to expect too much of a new leader and then to become disillusioned when he fails to deliver quickly.
If international investors and stakeholders who support his agenda are too impatient, he will be unable to bring about the economic growth that will bolster his support among South African voters.
Ramaphosa’s victory is an important sign that many within the ANC understand that they must change or risk being remembered as the party that allowed an avaricious few to sell off the country.
But change will be slow and hard.
Ramaphosa is expected to win a high-stakes game with a middling hand.
South African voters and the watching world must understand that his opponents are unlikely to fold quickly.
Why Do Cities Become Unaffordable?
NEW HAVEN – Inequality is usually measured by comparing incomes across households within a country.
But there is also a different kind of inequality: in the affordability of homes across cities.
The impact of this form of inequality is no less worrying.
In many of the world’s urban centers, homes are becoming prohibitively expensive for people with moderate incomes.
As a city’s real-estate prices rise, some inhabitants may feel compelled to leave.
Of course, if that inhabitant already owned a house there that they can sell, they may regard the price increase as a windfall that they can claim by departing.
If not, however, they may be forced out with no compensation.
The consequences are not just economic.
People may be forced out of cities where they have spent their entire lives.
Leaving amounts to losing lifelong connections, and therefore can be traumatic.
If too many lifelong inhabitants are driven out by rising housing prices, the city itself suffers from a loss of identity and even culture.
As such people depart, an expensive city gradually becomes an enclave of high-income households, and begins to take on their values.
With people of various income levels increasingly divided by geography, income inequality can worsen and the risk of social polarization – and even serious conflict – can grow.
As this year’s Demographia International Housing Affordability Survey shows, there are already massive disparities across major global cities (measured by the ratio of median home prices to median household income).
A high ratio correlates with high pressure for people to leave.
This year’s survey, which covered 92 cities in nine countries, showed that, as of late 2016, Hong Kong had the least affordable housing, with a price-to-income ratio of 18.1.
That means that paying off a 30-year mortgage on a median-price home would cost a median-income buyer more than half of their income – and that is without interest.
Mortgage rates are low in Hong Kong, but not zero, suggesting it is just about impossible for a median-income household to purchase a home there without access to additional funds from, say, a parent, or, if the buyer is an immigrant, from abroad.
After Hong Kong, the list continues with Sydney (12.2), Vancouver (11.8), Auckland (10), San Jose/Silicon Valley (9.6), Melbourne (9.5), and Los Angeles (9.3).
Next come London and Toronto – at 8.5 and 7.7, respectively – where housing is extremely expensive, but incomes are also high.
Meanwhile, some attractive world cities are quite affordable, relative to incomes.
In New York City, the median home price stands at 5.7 times median household income.
In Montreal and Singapore, that ratio is 4.8; in Tokyo and Yokohama, it is 4.7; and in Chicago, it is 3.8.
Maybe the figures for these outlier cities aren’t precise.
They are hard to check, and there must be inconsistencies across cities, countries, and continents.
For example, the geographical boundaries of the areas used to compute median price and median rent may vary.
In some cities, higher-priced homes may tend to turn over more rapidly than in others.
And some cities may be inhabited by larger families, implying bigger houses than in other cities.
But it seems unlikely that the errors could be so significant that they would change the basic conclusion: home affordability around the world is highly variable.
The question, then, is why residents of some cities face extremely – even prohibitively – high prices.
In many cases, the answer appears to be related to barriers to housing construction.
Using satellite data for major US cities, the economist Albert Saiz of MIT confirmed that tighter physical constraints – such as surrounding bodies of water or land gradients that make properties unsuitable for extensive building – tend to correlate with higher home prices.
But the barriers may also be political.
A huge dose of moderate-income housing construction would have a major impact on affordability.
But the existing owners of high-priced homes have little incentive to support such construction, which would diminish the value of their own investment.
Indeed, their resistance may be as intractable as a lake’s edge.
As a result, municipal governments may be unwilling to grant permits to expand supply.
Insufficient options for construction can be the driving force behind a rising price-to-income ratio, with home prices increasing over the long term even if the city has acquired no new industry, cachet, or talent.
Once the city has run out of available building sites, its continued growth must be accommodated by the departure of lower-income people.
The rise in housing prices, relative to income, is unlikely to be sudden, not least because speculators, anticipating the change, may bid up prices in advance.
They may even overshoot, temporarily pushing the ratios even higher than necessary, creating a bubble and causing unnecessary angst among residents.
But this tendency can be mitigated, if civil society recognizes the importance of preserving lower-income housing.
Many of the calls to resist further construction, residents must understand, are being made by special interests; indeed, they amount to a kind of rent seeking by homeowners seeking to boost their own homes’ resale value.
In his recent book The New Urban Crisis, the University of Toronto’s Richard Florida decries this phenomenon, comparing opponents of housing construction to the early-nineteenth-century Luddites, who smashed the mechanical looms that were taking their weaving jobs.
In some cases, a city may be on its way to becoming a “great city,” and market forces should be allowed to drive out lower-income people who can’t participate fully in this greatness to make way for those who can.
But, more often, a city with a high housing-price-to-income ratio is less a “great city” than a supply-constrained one lacking in empathy, humanitarian impulse, and, increasingly, diversity.
And that creates fertile ground for dangerous animosities.
The Real Risk to the Global Economy
WASHINGTON, DC – One of the great mysteries of today’s global markets is their irrepressible enthusiasm, even as the world around them appears on the verge of chaos or collapse.
And yet, investors may be more rational than they appear when it comes to pricing in political risks.
If investing is foremost about discounting future cash flows, it’s important to focus precisely on what will and will not affect those calculations.
The potential crises that may be most dramatic or violent are, ironically, the ones that the market has the easiest time looking through.
Far more dangerous are gradual shifts in international global institutions that upend expectations about how key players will behave.
Such shifts may emerge only slowly, but they can fundamentally change the calculus for pricing in risks and potential returns.
Today’s market is easy to explain in terms of fundamental factors: earnings are growing, inflation has been kept at bay, and the global economy appears to be experiencing a broad, synchronized expansion.
In October, the International Monetary Fund updated its global outlook to predict that only a handful of small countries will suffer a recession next year.
And while the major central banks are planning, or have already begun, to tighten monetary policy, interest rates will remain low for now.
Political crises, however sensational they may be, are not likely to change investors’ economic calculus.
Even after the greatest calamities of the twentieth century, markets bounced back fairly quickly.
After Japan’s attack on Pearl Harbor, US stock markets fell by 10%, but recovered within six weeks.
Similarly, after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, US stocks dropped nearly 12%, but bounced back in a month.
After the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, stock prices fell less than 3%, and recovered the next day.
Yes, each political crisis is different.
But through most of them, veteran emerging-markets investor Jens Nystedt notes, market participants can count on a response from policymakers.
Central banks and finance ministries will almost always rush to offset rising risk premia by adjusting interest rates or fiscal policies, and investors bid assets back to their pre-crisis values.
Today, a conflict with North Korea over its nuclear and missile programs tops most lists of potential crises.
Open warfare or a nuclear incident on the Korean Peninsula would trigger a humanitarian disaster, interrupt trade with South Korea – the world’s 13th largest economy – and send political shockwaves around the world.
And yet such a disaster would most likely be brief, and its outcome would be clear almost immediately.
The world’s major powers would remain more or less aligned, and future cash flows on most investments would continue undisturbed.
The same can be said of Saudi Arabia, where Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman just purged the government and security apparatus to consolidate his power.
Even if a sudden upheaval in the Kingdom were to transform the balance of power in the Middle East, the country would still want to maintain its exports.
And if there were an interruption in global oil flows, it would be cushioned by competing producers and new technologies.
Similarly, a full-scale political or economic collapse in Venezuela would have serious regional implications, and might result in an even deeper humanitarian crisis there.
But it would most likely not have any broader, much less systemic, impact on energy and financial markets.
Such scenarios are often in the headlines, so their occurrence is less likely to come as a surprise.
But even when a crisis, like a cyber attack or an epidemic, erupts unexpectedly, the ensuing market disruption usually lasts only as long as it takes for investors to reassess discount rates and future profit streams.
By contrast, changes in broadly shared economic assumptions are far more likely to trigger a sell-off, by prompting investors to reassess the likelihood of actually realizing projected cash flows.
There might be a dawning awareness among investors that growth rates are slowing, or that central banks have missed the emergence of inflation once again.
Or the change might come more suddenly, with, say, the discovery of large pockets of toxic loans that are unlikely to be repaid.
As emerging-market investors well know, political changes can affect economic assumptions.
But, again, the risk stems less from unpredictable shocks than from the slow erosion of institutions that investors trust to make an uncertain world more predictable.
For example, investors in Turkey know that the country’s turn away from democracy has distanced it from Europe and introduced new risks for future returns.
On the other hand, in Brazil, despite an ongoing corruption scandal that has toppled one president and could topple another, investors recognize that the country’s institutions are working – albeit in their own cumbersome way – and they have priced risks accordingly.
The greatest political risk to global markets today, then, is that the key players shaping investor expectations undergo a fundamental realignment.
Most concerning of all is the United States, which is now seeking to carve out a new global role for itself under President Donald Trump.
By withdrawing from international agreements and trying to renegotiate existing trade deals, the US has already become less predictable.
Looking ahead, if Trump and future US leaders continue to engage with other countries through zero-sum transactions rather than cooperative institution-building, the world will be unable to muster a joint response to the next period of global market turmoil.
Ultimately, a less reliable US will require a higher discount rate almost everywhere.
Unless other economic cycles intervene before investors’ expectations shift, that will be the end of the current market boom.
Rebuilding the Asylum System
NEW YORK – The European Union needs to accept responsibility for the lack of a common asylum policy, which has transformed this year’s growing influx of refugees from a manageable problem into yet another political crisis.
Each member state has selfishly focused on its own interests, often acting against the interests of others.
This precipitated panic among asylum seekers, the general public, and the authorities responsible for law and order. Asylum seekers have been the main victims.
The EU needs a comprehensive plan to respond to the crisis, one that reasserts effective governance over the flows of asylum-seekers so that they take place in a safe, orderly way, and at a pace that reflects Europe’s capacity to absorb them.
To be comprehensive, the plan has to extend beyond the borders of Europe.
It is less disruptive and much less expensive to maintain potential asylum-seekers in or close to their present location.
As the origin of the current crisis is Syria, the fate of the Syrian population has to be the first priority.
But other asylum seekers and migrants must not be forgotten.
Similarly, a European plan must be accompanied by a global response, under the authority of the United Nations and involving its member states.
This would distribute the burden of the Syrian crisis over a larger number of states, while also establishing global standards for dealing with the problems of forced migration more generally.
Here are the six components of a comprehensive plan.
First, the EU has to accept at least a million asylum-seekers annually for the foreseeable future.
And, to do that, it must share the burden fairly – a principle that a qualified majority finally established at last Wednesday’s summit.
Adequate financing is critical.
The EU should provide €15,000 ($16,800) per asylum-seeker for each of the first two years to help cover housing, health care, and education costs – and to make accepting refugees more appealing to member states.
It can raise these funds by issuing long-term bonds using its largely untapped AAA borrowing capacity, which will have the added benefit of providing a justified fiscal stimulus to the European economy.
It is equally important to allow both states and asylum-seekers to express their preferences, using the least possible coercion.
Placing refugees where they want to go – and where they are wanted – is a sine qua non of success.
Second, the EU must lead the global effort to provide adequate funding to Lebanon, Jordan, and Turkey to support the four million refugees currently living in those countries.
Thus far, only a fraction of the funding needed for even basic care has been raised.
If education, training, and other essential needs are included, the annual costs are at least €5,000 per refugee, or €20 billion.
EU aid today to Turkey, though doubled last week, still amounts to just €1 billion.
In addition, the EU also should help create special economic zones with preferred trade status in the region, including in Tunisia and Morocco, to attract investment and generate jobs for both locals and refugees.
The EU would need to make an annual commitment to frontline countries of at least €8-10 billion, with the balance coming from the United States and the rest of the world.
This could be added to the amount of long-term bonds issued to support asylum-seekers in Europe.
Third, the EU must immediately start building a single EU Asylum and Migration Agency and eventually a single EU Border Guard.
The current patchwork of 28 separate asylum systems does not work: it is expensive, inefficient, and produces wildly inconsistent results in determining who qualifies for asylum.
The new agency would gradually streamline procedures; establish common rules for employment and entrepreneurship, as well as consistent benefits; and develop an effective, rights-respecting return policy for migrants who do not qualify for asylum.
Fourth, safe channels must be established for asylum-seekers, starting with getting them from Greece and Italy to their destination countries.
This is very urgent in order to calm the panic.
The next logical step is to extend safe avenues to the frontline region, thereby reducing the number of migrants who make the dangerous Mediterranean crossing.
If asylum-seekers have a reasonable chance of ultimately reaching Europe, they are far more likely to stay where they are.
This will require negotiating with frontline countries, in cooperation with the UN Refugee Agency, to establish processing centers there – with Turkey as the priority.
The operational and financial arrangements developed by the EU should be used to establish global standards for the treatment of asylum-seekers and migrants.
This is the fifth piece of the comprehensive plan.
Finally, to absorb and integrate more than a million asylum seekers and migrants a year, the EU needs to mobilize the private sector – NGOs, church groups, and businesses – to act as sponsors.
This will require not only sufficient funding, but also the human and IT capacity to match migrants and sponsors.
The exodus from war-torn Syria should never have become a crisis.
It was long in the making, easy to foresee, and eminently manageable by Europe and the international community.
Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán has now also produced a six-point plan to address the crisis.
But his plan, which subordinates the human rights of asylum-seekers and migrants to the security of borders, threatens to divide and destroy the EU by renouncing the values on which it was built and violating the laws that are supposed to govern it.
The EU must respond with a genuinely European asylum policy that will put an end to the panic and the unnecessary human suffering.
Resuscitating Africa’s Health Care
FREETOWN, SIERRA LEONE – In late October, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) confirmed what many had long suspected: millions of dollars donated to fight the Ebola outbreaks in Guinea and Sierra Leone had been mismanaged and stolen.
The world’s oldest humanitarian organization was “outraged” by the findings, it said.
Needless to say, they were not alone.
I was national coordinator of Ebola burials for Sierra Leone at the height of the epidemic.
For much of the crisis, beginning in 2014, we lacked the equipment and materials needed to contain the deadly virus.
We lost many health workers amid the dearth of resources, and the thought of losing my own life – leaving behind a family and two young children – terrified me daily.
These were anxious times for my country.
That anxiety has not vanished.
My thoughts frequently return to colleagues who died during the heroic fight.
And now, with confirmation that huge sums of aid were stolen, the grief is compounded by anger and disappointment – at the fraud itself, but also for what it says about Africa’s struggles to improve health-care access and outcomes.
The rampant fraud illustrates how problematic it can be when donors channel resources through big NGOs like the Red Cross.
And the IFRC’s revelation is likely just the tip of the iceberg.
Sierra Leone’s minister of health and sanitation first warned of the possibility of widespread fraud in May 2015; he even called for a full accounting of money received and spent.
Unfortunately, his request was largely ignored.
The silence was lamentable, but not surprising; tracking donor funds is extremely difficult.
When governments and private donors pledge monetary aid, the funds typically pass through a chain of large groups that determine how it will be allocated.
But a full accounting often is never provided.
For example, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs estimates that $3.3 billion was donated to the countries that were hardest hit by Ebola.
And yet, the office’s data do not show how the money was spent.
There is widespread agreement among governments, development partners, and relief agencies that in a crisis like that caused by Ebola – or any other health emergency, for that matter – strong financial management is critical.
Only with disciplined budgeting can staff be properly equipped and paid, hospitals stocked, and triage centers opened.
When well-intentioned pledges fail to reach those in need, the result is measured in a lack of resources – from a shortage of doctors to a lack of vehicles to transport the sick and bury the dead.
Anger was my first emotion upon learning of the IFRC funding fraud.
But it is the second sentiment – disappointment – that must drive Africa forward.
If the continent is to make gains in achieving universal health coverage (UHC) and improving the quality of health care for everyone, it must start by ensuring that resources are used efficiently and fairly.
Some progress has been made in strengthening national planning processes and principles.
And, according to the UHC 2030 Alliance, which works to improve the quality of and access to health-care systems around the world, recipient countries have done far more than their international counterparts to establish more effective budgetary frameworks.
But Africa still has a long way to go before financial management and procurement systems meet adequate standards.
To improve the quality of Africa’s health-care systems, and avoid a repeat of the IFRC’s Ebola funding fiasco, countries that receive aid need better financial management protocols.
In health emergencies, immediate aid is essential.
But if that aid is to be allocated properly, recipient countries must already have the ability to manage large sums transparently.
The goal must be to ensure that recipient countries have oversight over how donor funds are spent.
At the moment, the opposite is happening, and most African countries are like the parched sailor adrift at sea – we see money everywhere, but we have no ability to use it.
To drink from the ocean of aid, African countries must first take control of their health-care funding destinies.
To do that, resources much be used efficiently.
A regional and sector-wide approach is critical to improving coordination and preventing duplication.
After the war and genocide in Rwanda, for example, the country’s government required that all development partners work according to the government’s agenda.
Today, Rwanda is among the world leaders in health-care access and outcomes.
Rwanda’s experience should serve as a model for other countries.
As the world observed Universal Health Coverage Day in December, I was left to reflect on the horrors of the last few years, and consider what steps we must take to improve health care in the future.
In Sierra Leone, as elsewhere, the focus must be on strong leadership, governance, and partnerships.
But most of all, we must use our collective dissatisfaction with past failures to fuel efforts to make quality health care a reality for everyone.
The Real Side of Fake News
NEW YORK – Today’s digital devices and social networks deliver so much information that even the savviest consumer cannot evaluate all of it.
We seem to be living in a version of Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World, where truth is drowned in a sea of irrelevance.
But the future need not be the dystopia that the present seems to suggest.
The share of Americans who get their news from social media has grown rapidly in recent years, to 62% as of 2016.
And yet, according to a recent study by the Pew Research Center, media, academic, technology, and publishing professionals have increasingly come to view the Internet as a cesspool of hate speech, anger, and trolls.
Much of what arrives on our digital doorstep these days is best described as “fake news”: hoax stories, propaganda, and other forms of misinformation.
But while “fake news” is a useful label for a very real problem, it does not tell us if we are in fact living in a “post-truth” world; and, if so, whom we should hold responsible.
To answer those questions, we need to examine the fake-news infrastructure.
Many of the anonymous political hobbyists and social hackers who are creating and disseminating fake news do so on Reddit.
With around 300 million monthly users globally, Reddit is the fourth most visited website in the US, and eighth in the world, as of this month.
A casual observer who visits Reddit will find what looks like a Web 1.0 message board that is ridden with near-indecipherable jargon and acronyms, such as “HH,” “cucks,” “centipedes,” and “God Emperor of the Internet.”
These are insider code words that did not emerge accidentally.
They respectively refer to “Heil Hitler,” critics of the so-called alt-right, Trump supporters, and, of course, Trump himself.
Despite being wildly popular, Reddit is mentioned in mainstream media coverage only when its most controversial conversations boil over, as occurred in 2008, when a Reddit subpage (or subreddit) called “Jailbait” provided a platform for users to exchange child pornography.
Following a public outcry, Reddit banned the subreddit in 2011, as it did again when the public took notice of a subreddit about stalking women called “CreepShots.”
Still, misogyny and hate speech have continued to flow freely on the site.
In an ugly masquerade of free speech, Reddit has hosted subreddits called “BeatingWomen,” “FatPeopleHate,” and “The Chimpire” (promoting racism).
Most recently, a “Pizzagate” subreddit hosted conspiracy theorists claiming that Hillary Clinton ran a child pornography ring out of a pizza restaurant in Washington, DC.
When Edgar Maddison Welch, armed with an AR-15, arrived at the establishment and started firing off rounds, the media finally, but only temporarily, took notice of Reddit’s role in the fake-news phenomenon.
Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian, for his part, doesn’t seem to spend much time worrying about the potential dangers posed by his website.
When Ohanian delivered a keynote address at the popular SXSW Interactive Festival in Austin, Texas, this year, he didn’t talk about the line between free speech and hate speech.
Nor did he mention the infamous subreddit “The_Donald,” which has more than 300,000 registered users, and may have played a critical role in electing Donald Trump.
Instead, he spoke about a Reddit user called “Shitty Watercolour,” and he declared “pseudonymity” to be the hallmark of freedom and uncensored speech.
During an “Ask Me Anything” session after his speech, Ohanian took no questions about Pizzagate, “The_Donald,” or hate speech.
To be sure, Reddit isn’t the only supporter of the kind of online anonymity that allows users to distribute hate speech and fake news without consequences.
And there are those who worry that cleaning up Reddit will only drive the trolls underground to less public sites like Voat.
But while other large online platforms such as Facebook are taking steps to address the problem, Reddit remains defiant.
Reddit’s relative immunity from criticism may help to explain its indifference.
As a top-ten site for US web traffic, it acts as a major conduit for media outlets, which use it to increase their page views, and thus their advertising revenues.
Reddit itself is owned by some familiar names.
Its single largest shareholder is Advance Publications, the parent company of Condé Nast; and its other investors include Marc Andreessen, Peter Thiel, Sam Altman, Ron Conway, Snoop Dogg, Jared Leto, and Josh Kushner, the brother of White House Senior Adviser Jared Kushner.
Sadly, none of these high-profile investors seems to have objected to Reddit’s hosting of subreddits called “WhiteNationalism,” “rapeisfun,” “BurningKids,” “cutefemalecorpses,” and so on.
Fake news is a symptom of a larger problem.
With advertising revenues declining, media organizations are increasingly desperate for clicks.
Most readers do not hesitate to share or re-tweet headlines that support their own biases and beliefs.
And technology companies shrug and claim that they are “just a platform,” while they reap profits from the traffic that fake news brings in.
So, what can news consumers do to push back against fake news?
For starters, we should be demanding that trusted media outlets avoid hosting their content on anonymous sites like Reddit.
And we should apply more pressure on companies like Advance Publications to take responsibility for the sites they own and what happens there.
Above all, that means rolling back the culture of digital anonymity that facilitates hate speech and misinformation.
Digital platforms should require those who espouse ideas and share information to sign their names to their output.
Pseudonyms are for fiction writers.
Reducing Inequality and Poverty in America
CAMBRIDGE – With a new American president and Congress taking office just six months from now, the time has come to rethink the government’s programs aimed at helping the poor.
The current election season has reflected widespread concern about the issue of inequality.
Reducing poverty, rather than penalizing earned success, is the right focus for dealing with it.
The United States government now spends more than $600 billion a year on programs to help the poor.
That’s about 4% of America’s total GDP.
Half of those outlays are for health programs, including Medicaid and the health-insurance subsidies under the 2010 Affordable Care Act (so-called Obamacare).
The other half are for a complex range of programs including food stamps, housing subsidies, the Earned Income Tax Credit, and cash relief.
To put that 4% of GDP in perspective, the federal government’s total revenue from the personal income tax is less than 9% of GDP, implying that nearly half is spent on these means-tested programs.
Spending on these programs also exceeds that for defense (3.3% of GDP) and the 3.3% of GDP spent on all other nondefense discretionary programs.
But, despite this large expenditure, the proportion of the population living in poverty is officially estimated at 15%, about the same as it was 50 years ago.
Experts agree, however, that the government’s poverty measure doesn’t correctly reflect the progress that has occurred, because official statistics focus only on cash income and ignore almost all of the government’s transfer payments.
Many of those who are poor, or would otherwise be poor, are also aided by Social Security benefits for retirees and survivors, and by Medicare for the disabled and those over age 65.
Because eligibility for benefits under these programs does not depend on income or wealth, the amounts spent for these programs are not included in outlays targeted at the poor.
The existing approach to helping the poor needs reform.
Myriad overlapping programs with different eligibility rules are difficult for the poor to navigate, create bad work incentives, and are unnecessarily costly to taxpayers.
The largest of the ten major means-tested programs is the food subsidy program, now called SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program).
Some 46 million people, about one-seventh of the US population, receive monthly benefits totaling $75 billion per year.
Despite its widespread use, the government estimates that only about 70% of those who are eligible receive benefits.
Eligibility to receive SNAP benefits is limited to households with incomes below 130% of the poverty level, about $1,700 a month for a family of three.
Because a decision by a second adult to work could eliminate eligibility, the program discourages employment and reduces earned incomes.
Although SNAP is described as a nutrition program, the average benefit of $130 per month is far less than these low-income households spend on food.
The program is thus really equivalent to a cash transfer.
As such, it dominates the program launched by President Bill Clinton to provide cash assistance with significant restrictions.
When Clinton declared in 1996 that he would “end welfare as we know it,” he worked with Congress to create the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program, which requires recipients to work and limits their lifetime eligibility to 60 months.
As a result of these conditions, the $17 billion program has declined in scale and has a participation rate of less than 50% percent of eligible households.
How should programs for the poor be changed to increase participation and avoid adverse effects on work incentives?
One bad idea that is getting a surprising amount of favorable attention is the so-called Universal Income Benefit: providing enough money to all households (below the age of 65) to keep them above the poverty line, even if they had no other income.
The amount given to each household would depend on the number of adults and children, but not on the household’s income or wealth.
This unconditional transfer would solve the problem of lifting all Americans out of poverty.
But it would be impossibly expensive.
Even if it replaced all of the means-tested programs for the poor other than the health programs, its net cost would exceed $1.5 trillion a year, or more than 9% of GDP.
To pay for that without raising the deficit would require doubling the personal income tax.
So the Universal Income Benefit is definitely a non-starter.
The best way to help the poor is the negative income tax plan originally proposed by both Milton Friedman (the conservative economist at the University of Chicago) and James Tobin (the liberal economist at Yale University).
All households below the age of 65 would receive an amount of money that would keep them out of poverty if they had no other income; but the amount of the transfer would decline gradually as their household income rose.
Above a certain threshold, the household would pay an income tax as they do today; below that level, the “tax” would be negative.
The rate at which the transfer declines would be set to limit adverse incentives while protecting the household’s living standard.
The health-care programs for the poor would continue.
While there is no perfect solution to the difficult problem of dealing with poverty, some solutions are better – often much better – than others.
The negative income tax may be the best way possible to achieve simplicity, inclusiveness, and moderate taxpayer cost.
The Referendum Charade
NEW YORK – Referendums are all the rage in Europe.
In June, British voters will decide whether the United Kingdom should remain in the European Union.
The Hungarian government has called for a referendum on accepting its quota of refugees set by the EU.
Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orbán, has already said that Hungary would resist letting them in.
“All the terrorists are basically migrants,” he said.
The referendum is likely to go his way.
Perhaps the oddest referendum will take place in April in the Netherlands, following a successful petition campaign.
The question put to Dutch citizens will be whether the Netherlands should sign up to an association agreement between the EU and Ukraine.
All other EU member countries have already agreed, but without the Dutch it cannot be ratified.
One might think that the details of trade agreements and tariff barriers with Ukraine would baffle most Dutch voters, and one might also wonder why they should care enough to hold a referendum.
But referendums fit the populist mood that is sweeping many countries, from Donald Trump’s America to Orbán’s Hungary.
Referendums are an example of what is known as “direct democracy.”
The voice of the people (or rather, the People) is not heard through their elected representatives in government, but directly through plebiscites.
When Winston Churchill suggested in 1945 that the British people should vote in a referendum on whether to continue the wartime coalition government, the Labour leader Clement Attlee opposed it.
He called referendums un-British and a “device of dictators and demagogues.”
Attlee was right.
Even though referendums are sometimes used in representative democracies, as when British voters elected to stay in the European Economic Community in 1975, dictators are much keener on them.
After invading Austria in 1938, Hitler asked the Austrians in a plebiscite whether they wanted to be annexed by Germany.
It was a choice they could not really refuse.
Despots like to be backed by plebiscites, because they do not only pretend to represent the People; they are the People.
The vogue for referendums today reflects distrust of political representatives.
Normally, in a liberal democracy, we vote for men and women expecting them to study and decide on issues that most ordinary citizens have neither the time nor the knowledge to deal with themselves.
Trade agreements are typically something that voters would not be asked to concern themselves with directly.
A referendum is not usually an accurate sounding of people’s rational faculties or a test of their expertise.
Referendums are about gut feelings, which can be easily manipulated by demagogues.
That is why demagogues like them.
So far, the Brexit debate in Britain has been almost entirely emotional, focusing on the historical greatness of Britain, the horrors of foreign tyrannies, or, conversely, fears of what might happen if the status quo were to be upset.
Very few British voters have a clue about how the European Commission actually works, or the role of the European Council, but most have some feeling about Britain standing alone against Hitler, or the prospect of being “swamped” by immigrants.
Usually, in a referendum, people decide on where they stand for reasons that have little to do with the question put to them.
Some people in Britain might choose to leave the EU just because they don’t like Prime Minister David Cameron, who is in favor of staying in.
Voters in the Netherlands and France voted against the proposed EU Constitution in 2005.
Very few had probably ever read the Constitution; it is in fact an unreadable document. The “no” vote stemmed from general discontent with political elites associated with “Brussels.”
To some extent, this was understandable – and not without justification.
EU negotiations are complex and opaque to most people, and EU institutions are remote.
No wonder many citizens feel that they have lost control over their political affairs.
Democratic national governments look more and more impotent, and the EU is not a democracy.
The desire for referendums is not only a sign of internal national divisions; it is yet another symptom of a global populist demand to “take back our country.”
This may be mostly delusional (outside the EU, Britain may actually have less power over its fate than if it stays in), but the crisis of confidence needs to be taken seriously.
After all, even if referendums are often frivolous, their consequences are not.
What happens in Ukraine is important.
Britain’s exit from the EU could have devastating results not only for the UK, but for the rest of Europe, too.
Hungary’s successful example of refusing to cooperate in solving the refugee crisis could provoke other countries to follow suit.
The fundamental problem is that a large number of people feel unrepresented.
Old party politics, governed by old elites working traditional networks of influence, no longer give many citizens a sense of participating in a democracy.
The extraordinary influence of a handful of billionaires in the US, and the lack of transparency in EU politics, aggravate this problem.
Direct democracy will not reestablish people's confidence in their political representatives.
But if a greater degree of trust is not restored, power will go to leaders who claim to speak in the People’s voice.
And nothing good ever came from that.
Putting a Price on Rainforests
NEW YORK – In early October, shortly after Hurricane Maria made landfall in Puerto Rico, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said on Twitter that his company could, given the opportunity, rebuild the island’s electrical grid using solar power.
Coming in the midst of so much human suffering, it was a bold claim.
But from a technological perspective, the timing was perfect.
By late October, solar panels and high-capacity batteries had been installed at San Juan’s Hospital del Niño, and additional projects are in the works.
This type of response to a natural disaster – replacing a fossil-fuel-reliant power grid with renewable energy – should be applauded.
But no matter how clean and efficient renewable energy sources may be, they will never fully mitigate the climatic effects that are bringing more hurricanes like Maria ashore.
There is another way to do that, and it is far cheaper than what Musk has proposed.
Puerto Rico is home to one of the most efficient and inexpensive tools available in the fight against climate change: rainforests.
On the island’s eastern tip, the nearly 29,000-acre El Yunque National Forest is one of the Caribbean’s most important systems for capturing and storing carbon.
Maria destroyed the forest, too.
But tech CEOs have not tweeted about restoring that resource, because, at the moment, they see no viable business model for saving trees.
But what if such a model did exist?
What if there were ways to make tropical forests worth more alive than dead?
Global leaders have been pondering this question for years.
And, at UN climate talks, they have come up with a novel solution: an initiative called Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+).
The idea is simple: with the right incentives, people, governments, and industries will preserve and restore tropical forests, rather than plow them under.
In return, the world gets more carbon sinks to soak up greenhouse gasses.
REDD+, which has been around in various forms for nearly a decade, provides a payment structure for preservation and restoration efforts.
By putting an economic value on forests for the role they play in large-scale carbon capture and storage, REDD+ allows standing trees to compete with lucrative land uses – such as logging or agriculture – that result in deforestation.
The first large-scale REDD+ program, an agreement between Norway and Brazil, was initiated in 2008.
Norway agreed to provide $1 billion in “performance-based payments” to Brazil for successfully protecting its rainforests.
The money from Norway was released in installments, as Brazil conserved its forests.
The results were impressive: Brazil reduced the average rate of Amazon deforestation by over 60% over the last decade, absorbing about 3.6 billion tons of carbon dioxide, more than any other country.
And Norway was able to help mitigate global carbon dioxide emissions.
But, despite the success of the pilot partnership, the REDD+ program today is in dire need of capital.
In many ways, the solution is similar to Musk’s solar proposal in Puerto Rico.
Only this time, the innovation is not technical, but financial.
Creating a market for REDD+ credits would create investment opportunities in tropical forest preservation for heavily polluting companies and industries.
With an adequate policy framework, REDD+ credits could be offered through existing compliance markets – such as the carbon credit markets in California or South Korea – unlocking billions in additional capital for reforestation efforts.
Developing such a framework would also enable REDD+ to become part of future compliance systems, like the one being developed by the global airline industry to cap emissions, or the carbon-permit market that China plans to launch later this year.
Integration into these markets could also tap new funding streams for forest conservation and reforestation, as it would allow financial intermediaries, like the REDD+ Acceleration Fund, to connect REDD+ projects directly with the private sector.
At the moment, most of this is aspirational.
REDD+ is merely a set of guidelines, and a forest credit market will require rules and standards to govern how protection and reforestation allowances are allocated to buyers and integrated into current markets.
Global leaders gathering this week for the UN climate change conference in Bonn, Germany, can aid these efforts by continuing to support the development of effective and transparent accounting mechanisms for REDD+ projects.
There is danger in delay.
In the two years since the Paris climate agreement was adopted, deforestation increased sharply in Indonesia and parts of the Amazon, where much of the world’s largest and most vital tropical forests stand.
According to the Union of Concerned Scientists, tropical deforestation is responsible for three billion tons of additional atmospheric CO2 annually – more than the world’s entire transportation sector.
No technology is as effective at storing carbon as tropical forests, and saving and restoring them offers one of the cheapest large-scale forms of emissions abatement or capture, while providing a host of other environmental and social benefits.
To take advantage of this crucial hedge against a warming planet, more trees must remain standing.
For those of us who believe that a forest credit market could provide critical means of protecting our planet our Musk moment is here.
We must be similarly bold.
The Evolution of the Refugee Crisis
LONDON – As they celebrate Christmas, Germans are also remembering the dead from last year’s attack on a Berlin Christmas market by a migrant who had been denied asylum.
That incident fanned the flames of public sentiment against immigration, and probably played a role in Chancellor Angela Merkel’s stunning failure to form a new a coalition government after the federal election in September.
Within the German electorate, there are widespread fears that another wave of migrants like the influx two years ago will deluge the country.
But the facts on the ground have changed dramatically.
On November 15, 2015, a migration command center in the German Foreign Ministry on Werderscher Markt in Berlin was tracking refugee flows at every potential border crossing on the route from Greece to Germany.
Eventually, of 12 million displaced Syrians, one million arrived in Europe.
And despite a massive response from the German government and members of the public, many asylum-seekers ended up sleeping on the streets and in railway stations.
At the time, there were rumors of a migrant-fueled crime wave sweeping the country, though later research found little increase in crime along migration routes.
Two year later, much has changed.
The German bureaucratic engine has been firing on all cylinders to process asylum claims and facilitate integration.
Of 700,000 asylum applications in 2016, almost 300,000 were denied, and those people are waiting to be returned to their countries of origin.
Greece, the first stop in the European Union for refugees from the Middle East, has started to close some refugee camps, after granting asylum to around 50,000 people.
And even Italy, the first EU port of call for African migrants, is now experiencing a decline in asylum applications.
Turkey, meanwhile, has stuck to its deal with the EU, whereby it receives financial aid in exchange for taking in Syrian refugees.
Before the deal entered into effect in March 2016, Turkey’s government had been actively encouraging migrants and refugees to continue to Europe; now, it is integrating refugees into Turkish society, and even trying to prevent high-skilled migrants from leaving.
Accordingly, the European Commission announced this month that it would provide another €700 million ($830 million) in aid to Turkey.
The situation has also improved in Northern Iraq (Iraqi Kurdistan).
Previously, the Syrian civil war and the rise of the Islamic State (ISIS) had displaced three million Iraqis and hundreds of thousands of Syrian Kurds.
But now that ISIS has been defeated militarily and its territory reclaimed, refugee Kurds have a choice of either staying in Iraq or returning to Syria.
Internally displaced Iraqis, on the other hand, are expected to return to whatever remains of their cities and homes – a process that has been accelerated by the Iraqi Kurds’ renewed push for independence this year.
Against this backdrop of relatively improved conditions, Lebanon stands out as an exception.
Although Lebanon has a population of just four million people, it is now host to more than 1.5 million Syrian refugees. The result is a growing sense of refugee fatigue, which is threatening to destabilize the country’s fragile multi-confessional power-sharing arrangement.
Already, the government’s rhetoric has started to focus on returning refugees to Syria, rather than on determining how best to provide for them.
As for the refugees themselves, many are visible in the streets of Beirut, the capital, but most are stuck in camps or temporary host communities, and lack adequate access to health care and schooling.
And even when refugees are accommodated by schools and universities, they have limited employment prospects after graduating.
Another lost generation is coming of age in a country that has long been riven by bungled integration efforts.
Making matters worse, following the resignation and return of Prime Minister Saad Hariri, Lebanon is now experiencing a political crisis that has raised the specter of a return to civil war.
So, what can be done?
Neighboring Jordan may offer one model to follow.
Rather than integrating refugees, Jordan has until recently kept them largely confined along the Syrian border.
At first, this left refugees with little access to education or labor markets.
But, thanks to concerted efforts by the international community and funding from the EU, there are now several programs in place to stimulate investment, encourage companies to hire refugees, and create special economic zones on the border.
The idea is that by spurring economic activity on the border, Syrian refugee communities and businesses can start to develop the capacity needed to rebuild post-war Syria when the time comes.
It is too soon to evaluate the full impact of these measures, but they are promising nonetheless.
But Europe, for its part, must do far more than provide funding.
The failure of European governments to manage the sudden influx of refugees in 2015 has fueled populism and intolerance in previously open societies.
True, this failure was partly due to genuine constraints, particularly in health-care and education systems. But it also reflected poor preparation, a lack of coordination, and insufficient investment.
The refugee crisis is fundamentally a systemic challenge, because developments in one country can affect many other countries.
As such, the crisis demands an EU-level and, indeed, a global response.
Fortunately, for the first time since Syria’s civil war began, there is hope that the EU might muster an effective joint approach to the problem.
In a wide-ranging speech at the Sorbonne in September, French President Emmanuel Macron injected new energy into EU policymaking in this area.
And, inspired by the Jordanian model, EU policymakers can now begin to develop a more coherent, evidence-based migration policy.
Of course, much will depend on Germany.
One hopes that its leaders will not let whipped-up sentiments about migration torpedo a coalition agreement.
They must recognize that German leadership in the EU and on the world stage is crucial for managing the migration challenge, not least in Germany itself.
Refugee Doctors for Refugee Health
TORONTO – Syrian refugees are often portrayed as an unwelcome drain on the communities to which they relocate, especially with regard to health care.
But, for those escaping Syria’s civil war, ignorance of their plight is overshadowed only by the reality of their needs – and the diversity of their expertise.
Although refugees do bring with them extensive health-care issues, they also bring years of experience in the medical profession that, if put to proper use, could be a boon to the communities that receive them, not to mention for other refugees.
One of the biggest challenges for refugees anywhere is finding a doctor.
In many host countries, inadequate treatment is the result of xenophobia, language barriers, or insufficient supply of medical staff.
This is especially true for Syrians, who are scattered across the Middle East, North Africa, Europe, and North America.
But many Syrian refugees are also highly educated.
As they settle in places far from the hospitals and clinics in which they once practiced, Syria’s doctors simply want to get back to work.
Isn’t it time that they did?
In the United Kingdom, efforts are underway to make that happen.
The National Health Service and the British Medical Association have begun retraining refugee doctors, including many from Syria and Afghanistan, to fill the ranks of depleted clinics in UK.
Through English-language training, postgraduate study, and professional registration, programs in London, Lincolnshire, and Scotland aim to reintegrate refugee doctors into the medical profession.
These efforts should be lauded.
Retraining refugee doctors is not only a moral exercise; it also makes practical sense.
Displaced doctors are better able to treat refugee patients’ ailments.
Refugee doctors can also help ensure that the flood of new patients does not overwhelm host countries’ health-care systems.
And retraining a refugee doctor is cheaper and faster than educating a new medical student.
With approximately 600 refugee doctors living in Britain, the well of untapped talent in the UK is deep.
Moreover, refugee patients benefit when treated by doctors who understand their circumstances, including the enormous psychosocial stress that displacement causes.
Translators can help, but they are not always available in crisis settings.
Doctors who understand refugees emotionally and culturally are better equipped to put patients at ease.
Britain is not alone in recognizing the potential of refugee doctors.
In Turkey, Syrian doctors and nurses have received training to help them become familiar with the Turkish health-care system.
The goal is to enable qualified Syrian professionals to treat refugee patients, thus mitigating the language and logistical barriers to effective, accessible, and dignified care.
But other host countries have not been as forward thinking.
In Lebanon and Jordan, for example, where more than 1.6 million registered Syrian refugees currently live, efforts to allow Syrian doctors to care for refugee patients have been criminalized.
Doctors ignoring the law face arrest and possible deportation.
Even Canada, a country that generally welcomes diversity and values human rights, is behind the curve on innovative approaches to refugee health.
Syrian doctors face “many, many years” of retraining in Canada, and often struggle to fund the high cost of recertification.
Amid this resistance, refugee health care should be viewed as more than a set of logistical and operational challenges, but also as an inherently political process.
Two dimensions of the issue must be addressed if refugee patients are ever to be properly cared for, and refugee doctors properly deployed.
For starters, refugee doctors may struggle to be accepted by their local colleagues, owing to political or personal bias.
Recognizing the potential for local resistance to integration programs for refugee doctors is essential to develop proactive policies that ensure success.
Moreover, refugee doctors must be trained to address the diversity of medical needs they will face in their adoptive homes.
For example, in many countries where refugees originate, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex (LGBTI) health concerns remain taboo, even among medical professionals.
For refugee doctors relocating to countries where LGBTI health and rights are recognized, integration curricula should include training on LGBTI health, particularly the rights of exceptionally vulnerable LGBTI refugees.
Improving health for LGBTI refugees can serve as a foundation for a more open society.
The refugee crisis that has engulfed Syria is just one ripple in a tidal wave of global displacement.
Around the world, some 22.5 million people are officially registered as refugees, and nearly 66 million have been forced from their homes.
These numbers are unlikely to fall in the near term, as calamities caused by climate change, and by human and natural disasters, continue to push even more people from their communities.
Every one of these future refugees will need access, at some point, to medical professionals trained in refugee health, diversity, and inclusion.
Empowering refugee doctors to become part of the solution will help overcome entrenched dogmas toward refugee diversity and social identities.
But, just as important, it will mark a crucial step forward in ensuring more inclusive refugee health.
How to Improve NAFTA
MEXICO CITY – As US President Donald Trump promised, renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) has commenced.
The initial talks are already sending a clear message: the disagreements to be resolved by Canada, Mexico, and the United States are fundamentally political, not economic, and they are as pronounced within each country as they are between them.
Contrary to popular belief, the true global trade dilemma of our time is not so much liberalization versus protectionism, but the rights of capital versus the rights of people.
In recent years, trade pacts have exacerbated imbalances on that front, by failing to deliver benefits for the many, rather than for a relatively few powerful corporations.
In this context, a focus on improving each NAFTA economy’s trade balance would be misguided.
Instead, negotiators must aim to spread the benefits of trade more widely, by taking better advantage of the opportunities for cooperation stemming from geographical proximity, complementary labor markets, demographic dynamics, and economic integration.
The Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) has the right idea, with negotiating objectives that cover labor issues and wages, transparency, corruption, and some aspects of human rights.
Canada has enriched this approach further, insisting that gender and the rights of indigenous people also be included.
Mexico has yet to say what it wants, but it should move in the same direction.
Issues relating to wages and working conditions will be particularly important to Mexico, where the prevailing approach can be called “patriotic exploitation.”
In short, workers’ rights and compensation are regarded as a concern for Mexican companies alone.
Though Mexico promised in 1993 to bring its labor standards into compliance with International Labor Organization guidelines, it has yet to follow through.
So, as labor productivity grows in Mexico, the additional income is appropriated mainly by companies and their shareholders, rather than by the workers creating the value.
As the CEO of United Technologies gushed, Mexican workers now do the same jobs to the same standard as their US counterparts, but for barely a fifth of the pay.
Mexico continues to operate under the assumption that wages low enough to attract and sustain investment ensure the shortest route to competitiveness.
The Mexican economic elite, therefore, considers it almost a patriotic duty to continue exploiting the country’s workers.
Spurring faster wage growth in Mexican manufacturing may require that free access to the US market be conditioned on it.
How could Mexico fulfill this condition?
In the long term, achieving full employment would do the job.
But, in the medium term, the key will be labor rights: unionization and collective bargaining; prohibition of child labor, unpaid overtime, unjustified dismissal, and excessive outsourcing; and skills training to meet the economy’s changing needs.
Including wage conditions in the revised NAFTA could also be meaningful in the US and Canada, especially with regard to the rights of migrant workers and permanent residents.
As for Mexico, immigration and migrants are the most important topic excluded from the original agreement.
The key to success will be effective penalties for non-compliance, focused on the withdrawal of trade benefits.
On corruption, too, it is likely to be difficult for Mexico to move forward without external discipline.
To be sure, since 2008, Mexico has sought to implement far-reaching reforms of the criminal justice system, and last year, it created a national anti-corruption system.
But the government has actively undermined its own efforts on both fronts, with the anti-corruption system having yet to see the light of day.
Meanwhile, calls by major civil-society organizations, business leaders, and top academics for the appointment of an autonomous and effective attorney general and anti-corruption prosecutor have met considerable resistance.
The NAFTA renegotiation provides an opportunity to internationalize Mexico’s anti-corruption fight.
Already, the USTR has identified corruption as an area of interest.
For example, the main provisions of the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act could be included in the new NAFTA, in order to raise Mexican standards of compliance.
The final chapter that should be added to the renegotiated NAFTA is also the most delicate: human rights.
Since the end of the 1990s, Mexico has accepted the idea of subjecting its commitments in this area to international scrutiny.
Yet this promises to be the most violent year in Mexico since 2006, when the “war on drugs” was declared.
There is reason to believe that concern in the US about its worsening opioid epidemic, which supposedly originates in the poppy fields of Mexico, will intensify the war effort – and, with it, human-rights violations.
With the Mexican government failing to translate its rhetoric on human rights into action, NAFTA may provide a powerful mechanism to improve outcomes.
Specific goals should include improved gender wage equality and a better balance between agricultural exporters’ prosperity and that of agricultural workers, many of whom are indigenous.
Trade pacts like NAFTA must no longer be regarded as charters of rights for large corporations.
They must serve ordinary citizens and address their problems.
To that end, today’s trade deals must take a cooperative approach that emphasizes capacity-building and encourages vigorous citizen participation, with civil society in each country assured the legal standing to present cases within the framework of a renegotiated agreement.
For the renegotiation of NAFTA to be worthwhile, it must address wages, corruption, and human rights – all particularly serious challenges for Mexico today.
If it does, Canada and the US will be better off as well.
The Irresistible Rise of the Renminbi
SEOUL – By the end of this year, the International Monetary Fund will decide whether the Chinese renminbi will join the euro, the Japanese yen, the British pound, and the US dollar in the basket of currencies that determines the value of its international reserve asset, the Special Drawing Right (SDR).
China is pushing hard for the renminbi’s inclusion.
Should it be admitted?
The IMF created the SDR in 1969 to supplement existing reserve currencies, thereby providing the global financial system with additional liquidity.
As it stands, the SDR’s role remains largely limited to IMF operations; its share in global financial markets and central banks’ international reserves is negligible.
Nonetheless, adding the renminbi to the SDR basket would be symbolically important, implying recognition of China’s growing global stature.
The renminbi is already a major currency for world trade and investment, and accounts for a growing share of international financial transactions and reserve holdings.
To qualify for inclusion, the Chinese government has eased its capital controls and liberalized its financial markets considerably.
Inclusion in the SDR basket would require continuing this process, which, together with the renminbi’s emergence as a globally investable currency, would benefit the entire world economy.
The IMF’s largest shareholders – the United States, Europe, and Japan – should thus welcome the renminbi’s addition to the SDR basket.
Yet opinions on the matter have been divided, with the US, in particular, reluctant to welcome China into the fold.
This is all the more problematic given that the 2008 financial crisis laid bare the international reserve system’s inadequacy when it comes to ensuring sufficient liquidity for emerging economies.
Although emerging economies have since accumulated larger foreign-exchange reserves and strengthened financial supervision and regulation, they remain vulnerable to external shocks, especially from the US, the eurozone, and Japan.
All three have lately employed expansionary monetary policies; and, as the US Federal Reserve normalizes its policy, emerging economies will be hit again by a sudden withdrawal of global liquidity.
This continued vulnerability reflects a collective failure to reform the global monetary system – an imperative that People’s Bank of China (PBOC) Governor Zhou Xiaochuan highlighted in early 2009.
Per Zhou’s proposal, China has championed a transition to a multi-currency reserve system, in which the SDR and an internationalized renminbi would be used more widely, including in countries’ currency reserves.
But its attempt in 2010 to add its currency to the SDR basket failed, because the renminbi was not “freely usable.”
Since then, China has implemented a series of reforms to increase the renminbi’s usage in foreign trade and direct investment, as well as in cross-border financial investment.
Fourteen renminbi-clearing banks have been established worldwide.
Last year, the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect was launched to stimulate cross-border investment and capital-market development.
And China has signed bilateral currency-swap agreements with 28 central banks, including the Central Bank of Brazil, the Bank of Canada, the European Central Bank, and the Bank of England.
This year, Chinese policymakers have signaled further financial liberalization by removing the domestic cap on banks’ deposit rates, thereby giving overseas institutional investors easier access to capital markets.
The PBOC is also likely to widen the currency’s trading band and move toward a more flexible exchange-rate regime.
As a result of these efforts, the renminbi has emerged as the second most used currency in trade finance, overtaking the euro, and the fifth most used for international payments.
Moreover, it is increasingly preferred in currency-market transactions and official foreign-exchange reserves.
Of course, China stands to gain much from the renminbi’s emergence as an alternative international reserve currency, sharing in the “exorbitant privilege” that the US currently enjoys by virtue of the dollar’s global status.
Beyond the convenience of conducting international transactions in local currency, China would be able to take advantage of seigniorage – safe in the knowledge that it would not face a balance-of-payments crisis.
But, in order to reach that point, China must confront significant risks.
Capital-account liberalization and renminbi internationalization invite potentially volatile cross-border capital flows, which could, for example, trigger rapid currency appreciation.
Given this, China can be expected to continue to manage capital-account transactions to some extent, using macroprudential measures and, when appropriate, direct capital controls.
Even if China manages to mitigate such risks, unseating the US dollar as the dominant global currency will be no easy feat.
Inertia favors currencies that are already in use internationally, and China lacks deep and liquid financial markets, an important precondition that any international reserve currency must meet.
Furthermore, China’s banking system, which remains subject to extensive government control, lags far behind those of the US and Europe in terms of efficiency and transparency.
If, however, China succeeds in developing a more convertible capital account and bolstering its financial system’s efficiency, the renminbi is likely to emerge as a new international reserve currency, complementing the US dollar and the euro.
This would benefit companies and central banks alike, by enabling them to diversify their foreign-currency holdings further.
History suggests that a shift in global currency dominance is likely to occur gradually.
For now, China is focused on winning the renminbi’s inclusion, even with a small share, in the SDR currency basket.
The IMF’s major shareholders should seriously consider it.
The renminbi’s continued internationalization, not to mention further progress on critical financial reforms, would contribute to the creation of a more stable and efficient global reserve system.
China’s Lonely Fight Against Deflation
HONG KONG – In early February, as China celebrated the start of the Year of the Monkey, a widely circulated hedge-fund newsletter roiled financial markets by predicting a hard landing for the economy, the collapse of the shadow-banking system, and the devaluation of the renminbi.
Stability returned only after People’s Bank of China Governor Zhou Xiaochuan, in an interview with Caixin magazine, explained the logic of China’s exchange-rate policy.
But China’s ability to maintain that stability depends on a multitude of interrelated factors, such as low productivity growth, declining real interest rates, disruptive technologies, excess capacity and debt overhangs, and excess savings.
In fact, the current battle over the renminbi’s exchange rate reflects a tension between the interests of the “financial engineers” (such as the managers of dollar-based hedge funds) and the “real engineers” (Chinese policymakers).
Foreign-exchange markets are, in theory, zero-sum games: the buyer’s loss is the seller’s gain, and vice versa.
Financial engineers love speculating on these markets, because transaction costs are very low and leveraged naked shorts are allowed, without the need to hedge an underlying asset.
The exchange rate, however, is an asset price that has huge economic spillovers, because it affects real trade and direct-investment flows.
Nowadays, financial engineers increasingly shape the exchange rate through financial transactions that may not be linked to economic fundamentals.
Because financial markets notoriously overshoot, if the short-sellers win by pushing exchange rates and the real economy into a low-level equilibrium, the losses take the form of investment, jobs, and income.
In other words, financial engineers’ gain is real people’s pain.
In order to achieve these gains, financial engineers use the media to influence market behavior.
For example, short-sellers portray sharp declines in commodity and oil prices as negative factors, even though lower energy prices actually benefit most consumers – and even some producers, by allowing them to compete with their oligopolistic counterparts.
It is estimated that lower oil and commodity prices could add some $460 billion to China’s trade balance, largely offsetting the loss in foreign-exchange reserves in 2015.
Similarly, China’s growth slowdown and the rise of non-performing loans are being discussed as exclusively negative developments.
But they are also necessary pains on the path to supply-side reform aimed at eliminating excess capacity, improving resource efficiency, and jettisoning polluting industries.
The real engineers, excluding those whose judgment is clouded by personal financial interests, should counter this influence, while refusing to succumb to the temptation of quick fixes.
Fortunately, China’s authorities have long understood that a stable renminbi exchange rate is critical to national, regional, and global stability.
Indeed, that is why they did not devalue the renminbi during the Asian financial crisis.
They saw what most analysts missed: leaving the US dollar as the main safe-haven currency for global savings, with near-zero interest rates, would have the same deflationary impact that the gold standard had in the 1930s.
In the face of today’s deflationary forces, however, real engineers in the world’s major economies have been unwilling or unable to reflate.
The United States, the world’s largest economy, will not use fiscal tools to that end, owing to domestic political constraints.
Europe’s unwillingness to reflate reflects Germany’s deep-seated fear of inflation (which underpins its enduring commitment to austerity).
Japan cannot reflate because of its aging population and irresolute implementation of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s economic plan, so-called Abenomics.
And China is still paying for the excessive reflation caused by its CN¥4 trillion ($586 billion) stimulus package in 2009, which added over CN¥80 trillion to its own debt.
Meanwhile, the consequences of financial engineering are intensifying.
Zero and negative interest rates have not only encouraged short-term speculation in asset markets and harmed long-term investments; they have also destroyed the business model of banks, insurance companies, and fund managers.
Why should savers pay banks or fund managers 1-2% intermediation costs when prospective returns on investments are zero?
A system in which financial intermediaries can increase profits only by increasing leverage – sustainable only by increasing quantitative easing – is doomed to fail.
Indeed, in hindsight, it seems clear that financial engineers outperformed the real economy only with the support of super-financial engineers – that is, central banks.
Initially, balance-sheet expansion – by $5 trillion since 2009 – provided banks with the cheap funding they needed to avoid failure.
But bank deleveraging (brought about by stiffer regulatory requirements), together with negative interest rates, caused financial institutions’ equity prices to fall, leading to further pro-cyclical destruction of value through price deflation, increasing illiquidity, and crowded exits.
Past experience has taught China’s real engineers that the only way to escape deflation is through painful structural reforms – not easy money and competitive devaluation.
The question is whether the US and other reserve-currency countries will share the burden of maintaining global currency stability, through an agreement resembling the 1985 Plaza Accord, in which five major economies agreed to depreciate the US dollar against the Japanese yen and the German Deutsche Mark.
If not, why would Asia’s net lenders, especially China, continue funding speculation against themselves?
The US dollar is a safe haven, but savers in need of liquidity still lack an impartial lender of last resort.
Depositing in reserve currencies at near-zero interest rates makes sense only if the banker is not funding financial speculation against the depositor.
But, as it stands, financial engineers have a lot of freedom; indeed, if they are big enough, they can’t fail or, apparently, even go to jail.
China’s G-20 presidency this year offers an important opportunity to emphasize that renminbi stability is important not only for China, but also for the global financial system as a whole.
If the US dollar enters into another round of revaluation, the only winners will be financial engineers.
Republicans’ Responsibility for Gun Violence
BOSTON – After the mass shooting at a concert in Las Vegas, Nevada, on Sunday night, Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told reporters that, “It’s particularly inappropriate to politicize an event like this.
It just happened within the last day and a half.”
With 59 dead and more than 500 injured, McConnell insisted that it was “[e]ntirely premature to be discussing about legislative solutions” to America’s gun-violence epidemic.
His party’s legislative priority, he added, would continue to be tax cuts.
McConnell’s response was fully in keeping with the Republican Party’s stance on gun violence.
It is disheartening, however, that none of the reporters assembled in front of McConnell so much as tried to call him out on his position.
It would not have been unreasonable to ask the Senate majority leader: “If you think it is premature now, then when do you think the right time will be?
Could you provide a timetable?”
Nor would it be unreasonable to question the premise that Democrats are “politicizing” a tragedy.
After all, claiming politicization has been the go-to Republican talking point after every gun massacre for decades now.
McConnell and his Republican colleagues should have to explain why they will not even discuss policy solutions to the scourge of gun violence in America, instead of being allowed to continue pursuing their transparent efforts simply to avoid the issue of gun control.
And they must be held accountable for their positions, which reflect an instinct, both telling and chilling, to view any discussion about gun violence as a political issue, offering an opportunity to score partisan points, rather than as a policy and public-safety issue.
One could argue that the repeated mass shootings in the United States over the past few decades have all had a Republican stamp on them.
After every (predictable) tragedy, the party mobilizes to block any legislation that might strengthen gun controls.
In 1996, the Republican-controlled Congress went so far as to threaten to defund the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention if it even tried to study gun violence.
Until the Sandy Hook massacre in 2012, the CDC was forced to abstain from conducting any such research.
The response to the Las Vegas shooting from Paul Ryan, the Republican Speaker of the House of Representatives, has been to dismiss the issue of guns, and to instead frame the tragedy as primarily a mental-health issue.
Accordingly, Ryan has been breathily touting reforms to the mental-health system that Republicans supposedly worked on in the past.
But Ryan chose not to mention the fact that, this past February, his Republican colleagues (and four Democrats) in the Senate voted to revoke a rule requiring the Social Security Administration to report the names of mentally-disabled Social Security recipients to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System.
After that vote, US President Donald Trump repealed the rule, allowing mentally ill individuals to purchase deadly firearms without hindrance.
Ryan also neglected to mention that his party’s repeated efforts to repeal the 2010 Affordable Care Act (“Obamacare”) included plans to defund mental-health programs, and to eliminate a rule requiring insurance companies and Medicaid to provide mental-health treatments.
Journalists and pundits tend to be vague when assessing culpability in this distinctly American tale.
They blame the failure to address America’s gun-violence problem on Congress, the “Washington establishment,” or the political system as a whole.
Such manufactured even-handedness is tantamount to “fake news.”
It is time to call a spade a spade: the Republican Party is overwhelmingly responsible.
Consider the issue of “bump stocks,” the gun modification that the perpetrator of the Las Vegas massacre used to be able to fire faster.
Some Republican senators have now drawn praise for indicating that they will support a ban on the device.
But when Democratic Senator Diane Feinstein proposed a similar ban in 2013, Republicans overwhelmingly opposed her.
After decades of such staunch opposition to any semblance of gun control, the small amount of flexibility Republicans are showing on banning bump stocks – which will just make killing with semi-automatic weapons slightly slower – should not be reason for high praise.
To be sure, some congressional Democrats and independents have occasionally joined with Republicans in blocking gun-control legislation.
But there is a fundamental difference: Democrats who oppose gun controls do so in defiance of their party’s official program, whereas Republicans do so in conformity with theirs.
As a result, the degree of culpability between the parties is not even close.
For evidence of this, one need only follow the money.
According to the Los Angeles Times, in 2016, the National Rifle Association (NRA) donated $52.6 million to electoral campaigns, of which just $265 – yes, you read that right – went to Democratic candidates.
McConnell received $1.3 million from the NRA in 2016 alone.
After the 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, where a lone gunman murdered 26 schoolchildren and their teachers, Senator Joe Manchin, a Democrat, proposed a bill to require universal background checks on all commercial gun purchases.
The Manchin Amendment failed to gain the 60 votes needed to overcome a Republican filibuster.
Just four of the 54 senators who voted in favor of the bill were Republicans; only five of the 46 senators who voted against it were Democrats.
Mass murderers such as Adam Lanza at Sandy Hook, Omar Mateen at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando in 2016, Stephen Paddock in Las Vegas, and countless others pulled the trigger.
But the Republican Party acted as a political accomplice to all of these murderous acts.
America’s Supply-Side Scam
NEW HAVEN – Tax cuts masquerading as tax reform are the best way to describe the thrust of Washington’s latest policy gambit.
The case is largely political – namely, the urgency of a Republican Congress to deliver a legislative victory for a Republican president.
The consequences, however, are ultimately economic – and, unsurprisingly, likely to be far worse than the politicians are willing to admit.
Taking the lead from President Donald Trump, the political case for tax cuts is that they are essential to “make America great again.”
Over-taxed and cheated by bad trade deals, goes the argument, America needs tax relief to revive its competitive prowess.
Notwithstanding the political pandering to hard-pressed middle-class families, corporate America is clearly the focus of these efforts, with proposed legislation aiming to reduce business tax rates from 35% to 20%.
Never mind that US companies currently pay a surprisingly low effective corporate tax rate – just 22% – when judged against post-World War II experience.
And pay no attention to the latest tally of international competitiveness by the World Economic Forum, which finds the US back in second place (out of 137 countries). And, of course, don’t draw comfort from the lofty stock-market valuations of the broad constellation of US companies.
Forget all that, Republicans insist: cut business taxes, they say, and all that ails America will be cured.
There are times when the politicization of economic arguments becomes dangerous.
This is one of those times.
The US simply can’t afford the current tax cuts making their way through Congress.
According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the cuts will result in a cumulative deficit of about $1.4 trillion over the next decade.
The problem arises because America’s chronic saving shortfall has now moved into the danger zone, making it much more difficult to fund multi-year deficits today than was the case when cutting taxes in the past.
The so-called Kennedy tax cuts of 1964 and the Reagan tax cuts of 1981 are important cases in point.
The net national saving rate – the broadest measure of domestic saving, which includes depreciation-adjusted saving of households, businesses, and the government sector – averaged 10.1% during those two years (1964 and 1981).
In other words, back then the US could afford to enact major tax cuts.
That is not the case today, with the net domestic saving rate a mere 1.8% of national income.
Even during the two tax cuts that followed – the second installment of Reagan’s fiscal program in 1986, and the initiatives of George W. Bush in 2001 – the net national saving rate averaged 4.2%, more than double the current level.
Both experience and macroeconomic theory indicate what to expect.
Saving-short economies simply cannot go on deficit-spending binges without borrowing surplus saving from abroad.
That is what brings the balance-of-payments and trade deficits directly into the debate over fiscal policy.
Significantly, the US current account was in slight surplus during the big tax cuts of 1964 and 1981 – in sharp contrast to today’s deficit of 2.6% of GDP.
With fiscal deficits likely to push an already-low domestic saving rate even lower – possibly back into negative territory, as was the case from 2008-11 – there is a great risk of a sharply higher current-account deficit.
And a bigger current-account deficit means that the already-large trade deficit will only widen further, violating one of the main tenets of Trumponomics – that making America great again requires closing the trade gap.
It is at this point where the tale goes from fact to fiction.
Trump and the congressional Republican majority insist that the proposed tax cuts will be self-financing, because they will spur economic growth, causing revenues to surge.
This so-called supply-side argument, first advanced in support of the Reagan-era tax cuts, has been a lightning rod in US fiscal policy debates ever since.
Reality has turned out quite differently than the supply-siders envisioned.
Yes, the economy recovered spectacularly from a deep recession in 1981-1982.
But that was due largely to an aggressive easing of monetary policy following the Federal Reserve’s successful assault on double-digit US inflation.
By contrast, the fiscal nirvana long promised by supply siders never materialized.
Far from vanishing into thin air, federal budget deficits ballooned to 3.8% of GDP during the 1980s, taking public debt from 25% of GDP in 1980 to 41% by 1990.
Not only did the supply siders’ self-funding promises go unfulfilled; they also marked the beginning of the end for America’s balance-of-payments equilibrium.
From 1960 to 1982, the current account was basically in balance, with a surplus averaging 0.2% of GDP.
On the heels of the budget deficits of Reaganomics and the related plunge in national saving, the current account swung sharply into deficit, averaging -2.4% of GDP from 1983 to 1989.
And it has remained in deficit ever since (with the exception of a temporary reprieve in the first two quarters of 1991 due to external funding of the Gulf War).
Far from a recipe for greatness, the Trump fiscal gambit spells serious trouble.
Lacking in saving, outsize US budget deficits point to sharp deterioration on the balance-of-payment and trade fronts.
Nor will creative supply-side accounting alter that outcome.
A “dynamic scoring” by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center suggests growth windfalls might prune the multiyear deficit from $1.4 trillion to $1.3 trillion over the next decade – hardly enough to finesse America’s intractable funding problem.
George H.W. Bush said it best when he was campaigning for the Republican presidential nomination in April 1980.
He rightly criticized the “voodoo economic policy” of his opponent, Ronald Reagan.
For today’s saving-short US economy, déjà vu is a painful understatement of what lies ahead.
Making America’s Deficits Great Again
FRANKFURT – US President Donald Trump and congressional Republican allies have succeeded in passing their big tax legislation.
While it lacks many of the desirable attributes of true tax reform, it amounts to a success for Trump, who failed to deliver any other major piece of legislation during the first year of his administration.
But what will it mean for Trump’s other major promise, to cut the US trade deficit?
Simply put, the Republicans’ tax law – which emphasizes big cuts, especially for corporations and the highest-income earners – is virtually certain to widen the budget deficit and, in turn, increase the current-account deficit.
Trump’s legislative victory implies the return of the infamous twin deficits that followed George W. Bush’s tax cuts of 2001 and 2003, and Ronald Reagan’s cuts of 1981-1983.
There are different ways to measure the balance of payments, each appropriate for different purposes.
The narrowest – and probably the least informative – measure includes only merchandise trade.
Yet Trump likes to focus on bilateral merchandise balances, rather than a broader and more useful indicator, such as the overall balance of goods and services.
The current-account balance is broader still, including such other transactions as net investment earnings from abroad, expatriates’ remittances, and foreign aid.
It is useful, because it shows whether the United States is spending beyond its means and therefore going into debt to the rest of the world.
And, whichever approach an economist takes, the result is clear: Trump’s tax cuts will have a negative effect on the current-account balance.
Start with the simple Keynesian model.
A tax cut boosts income and spending.
True, Trump’s tax cut focuses heavily on corporate taxes, rather than personal income taxes.
But, as Republicans like to point out, corporations are people, too, in the sense that people own and run them.
Most of the corporate windfall that Trump’s tax cut will deliver will be passed through to shareholders in the form of dividends and share buy-backs, and given to managers as higher pay.
The recipients will spend some of that additional income on foreign goods, boosting imports and worsening the trade balance.
The simple Keynesian model is less relevant when the economy is at full employment, as the US now is, and output is constrained by capacity.
But, under such circumstances, the result is also problematic: the increase in spending afforded by tax cuts goes entirely, rather than only partly, into the current-account deficit.
Moreover, when output is constrained, the increased demand tends to lead to inflation.
Higher prices for US products will reinforce domestic consumers’ incentive to buy foreign products, while reducing external demand for US exports.
The result, again, will be a larger trade deficit.
What about the burst of investment and eventual rise in productivity that is supposed to result from the Republican tax reform?
In the short run, higher investment is another form of spending: yet again, imports rise, and the trade deficit widens.
This effect is likely to be compounded by the expectation that a lower corporate tax rate will attract foreign investment, resulting in a net capital inflow.
According to the so-called intertemporal approach, a policy change that people believe augurs higher productivity in the future causes a current-account deficit today.
And, in fact, the model that White House economists use to claim that the corporate tax cut will raise wages assumes a large capital inflow and current account deficit.
The net capital inflow will be even larger if the US Federal Reserve continues to respond to increases in demand by raising interest rates.
This policy would probably also drive up the value of the US dollar, which would undermine the international price competitiveness of US exports and worsen the trade balance further.
So, whichever approach one takes, it is hard to escape the conclusion that the Republican tax cut will widen the trade and current-account deficits, achieving the opposite of what Trump has promised.
But that doesn’t mean that Trump skeptics can just sit back and wait for him to be proven wrong, because it is possible that, in the first year, the reported trade deficit will narrow, even as the true trade deficit widens.
It all comes down to “transfer pricing” – the prices multinational corporations use to put a value on cross-border trade in inputs among their subsidiaries.
Consider an American pharmaceutical company that establishes a plant in Ireland.
The Irish affiliate imports some inputs (most notably, the intellectual property represented by the drug patent), assembles the product in Ireland, and exports it back to the US.
In terms of value-added, the patent makes the biggest contribution.
But, because the corporate tax rate is lower in Ireland than in the US, the company has an incentive to assign a low value to the patent, thereby maximizing the profits in Ireland and minimizing them in the US, where the patent was developed.
This sort of profit-shifting – or, put another way, “creative accounting” – is widespread, and has long made the US trade balance appear worse than it really is (while making US primary income look better than it really is).
George Saravelos and his colleagues at Deutsche Bank argue that eliminating the measurement error that arises from inaccurate transfer pricing could give a one-time boost to the reported trade balance – particularly in the form of reported service exports – as large as $250 billion.
The trade deficit would ostensibly be halved.
But there is a difference between the reported trade balance and the true one; whatever narrowing of the trade deficit arises from the adjustment of transfer prices would be illusory.
Moreover, the current-account balance, reported or true, would not improve at all, because the apparent improvement in service exports would be offset by an apparent worsening of profits earned abroad.
On the contrary, that balance would deteriorate, for all the reasons stated above.
No matter how you look at it, the Republican tax cut, by widening the budget deficit, will fuel growth in the US current-account deficit.
It’s the early 1980s all over again.
But it’s not morning in America.
Supply-Side Amnesia
BERKELEY – In the spring of 1980, Harvard University economist Martin Feldstein taught (alongside Olivier Blanchard) one of the best macroeconomics classes I ever took.
Two and a half years later, Feldstein joined US President Ronald Reagan’s cabinet, where he chaired the Council of Economic Advisers until July 1984.
While in the White House, Feldstein waged a persuasive but lonely bureaucratic campaign against the Reagan administration’s 1981 income-tax cuts, arguing that they had been too big, and would prove economically painful if not corrected.
Feldstein’s position was not popular among other Reaganites.
Rather than heed his warnings, Reagan’s chief of staff, James Baker, convinced others in the administration to stay the course, so that they would not have to admit that the president’s signature tax-cutting initiative had been a mistake.
Baker and his cohort won the political debate.
The Reagan tax cuts remained in place, and created a federal budget deficit that would not be tamed until President Bill Clinton started to bring spending and revenues back into line in 1993.
Clinton accomplished this feat despite unanimous objections from every Republican in the US Congress.
The Reagan-era deficits helped the US economy recover from the 1981-82 recession.
But after 1984, growth slowed, because resources that should have been allocated for investment were instead spent on consumption, particularly among higher-income earners.
Ultimately, the Reagan tax cuts hammered manufacturing in the Midwest, creating what is now known as the “Rust Belt.”
As it happened, this is precisely what Feldstein had warned about.
He had argued that prevailing economic conditions implied that wider budget deficits would result in higher interest rates and a stronger dollar, making it harder for US manufacturers to compete with imports.
I believe that if Feldstein’s warning had been heeded in 1982-84, America would be stronger and happier today.
I was thus dismayed at his recent expression of optimism that under today’s Republican-led Congress, “a tax reform serving to increase capital formation and growth will be enacted,” while arguing that “any resulting increase in the budget deficit will be only temporary.”
I would respond to Feldstein with three questions.
First, when in recent memory has a Republican-sponsored tax cut not created a deficit?
Second, when have those deficits been “temporary,” apart from the occasions when later Democratic administrations reduced them by reversing the underlying tax cuts (as Clinton did after Reagan, and Barack Obama did after George W. Bush)?
And, finally, when have investments stemming from Republican tax cuts ever raised more in national savings than has been depleted by the ensuing budget deficits?
The answer to all three questions is simple: never.
A pro-growth, revenue-neutral tax-reform package might be possible in the United States if it were designed by a bipartisan group of centrists, which is what happened with the Tax Reform Act of 1986.
Such a bill today would need to promise lower tax rates for those who are heavily taxed, and only limited tax increases for those who are lightly taxed.
And any changes made would need to translate into relatively large growth benefits.
Unfortunately, the tax-reform effort currently underway in the US is not backed by a group of bipartisan centrists, but by right-wing Republicans who believe that taxes are an affront to billionaires’ liberties.
Rather than starting from the center and making appeals to both sides, congressional Republicans are starting from the right and feinting toward the center.
At the end of the day, cutting taxes for the wealthy is their top priority, regardless of whether such cuts lead to more domestic investment.
Feldstein’s language in describing the current Republican tax-reform effort is telling.
“The House Republican plan would cut the top tax rate back to 30% or lower,” he writes, before listing a few “mights”: the bill “might…eliminate the estate tax”; and it “might eliminate tax deductions for state and local taxes, and tax some of the fringe benefits that are currently excluded from taxable income.”
Further down, he claims that the bill “would reduce [the corporate-tax] rate to 25% or less,” which, he asserts, is “likely to boost domestic corporate investment.”
But whether the Republican plan “would” do something depends largely on those “mights.”
The bill might yield a net benefit for all or most Americans, or it might be a handout to the super-wealthy.
Given that the effort is being led by hard-right Republicans who care more about cutting taxes than holding down deficits, my bet is on the latter outcome – the one Feldstein warned about in the early 1980s.
Another Look at Tax Reform and Economic Growth
STANFORD – In late November, a group of economists, including me, published an open letter to US Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin in the Wall Street Journal, in which we offered an evaluation of the positive growth effects of the Republican tax package that is now coming to a vote.
Former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers and former Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers Jason Furman, raised several technical questions about our conclusions.
We responded.
Another signatory, Harvard University’s Robert Barro, then published a deeper elaboration of the tax plan’s growth effects here at Project Syndicate, to which Summers and Furman offered a response.
Summers and Furman originally suggested that we should leave estimations of the tax plan’s growth effects to the career government revenue scorers. “Instead of being used to justify this tax bill,” they later wrote, “Barro’s insights could have helped to shape a much better tax bill.”
Rather than revisit the technical issues to which we already responded, I want to offer a few additional thoughts that might contribute to a broader perspective.
First, on the question of whether or not to pass this tax bill, Summers and Furman, like those of us they are criticizing, have enough experience in policymaking to know that the end product usually diverges from what economists would consider ideal.
Needless to say, plenty of policies enacted during President Barack Obama’s administration, in which they admirably served, fit that description, as do others from prior administrations.
I agree that the current tax bill could, in principle, have been better.
For example, I would welcome making the equipment-expensing provision permanent, broadening the personal-income-tax base, or fully integrating corporate and personal taxes at lower income-tax rates. But such a bill would not pass Congress.
The question, then, is whether a viable final bill will be better than the status quo, not whether the final bill could have been better.
Second, Barro and I have clearly come to a different conclusion than Summers and Furman have about the bill, based on our own judgments about the links between corporate-tax reform and economic growth.
While I certainly respect Summers and Furman’s right to their views, I am not about to cede my professional judgment to others, in or out of government.
Third, there are legitimate differences of opinion on how much and how quickly the tax plan will affect investment decisions (particularly equipment investments), and thus long-run economic growth.
Summers’s own research results dramatically drive home that point.
Using data from a variety of countries and time periods, some as short as five years, he and Brad DeLong of the University of California, Berkeley, (who also opposes the current tax bill) have made the strongest case I know that equipment investment can have a large impact on GDP growth.
Moreover, the effect they estimate is much larger than in the conventional models used in most studies, including those relied on by government revenue scorers.
“The analysis suggests a strong and causal relationship between equipment investment and economic growth,” according to Summers and DeLong.
They concluded that, “an increase of three or four percentage points in the share of GDP devoted to equipment investment is associated with an increase in GDP per worker of one percent per year.”
So, to achieve the 0.3% increase in annual GDP growth that is now being debated, equipment investment would need to rise by 1% of GDP per year, sizeable to be sure, but well within the range of historical experience.
Summers and DeLong also calculate that the social returns from equipment investment are far larger than private returns.
Thus, they concluded that “a strong case seems to exist for making sure economic policy does not penalize, and in fact, rewards, investors in equipment”; and that “measures that reduce the tax burden on new equipment investment are likely to be especially potent in maximizing the equipment investment engendered per dollar of government revenue forgone.”
Finally, they noted that, “policies with an anti-equipment bias include tax rules that subsidize assets that can easily be levered … [and] pieces of equipment are frequently more difficult to use as collateral for debt than are investments in structures.”
Summers and DeLong attribute the large growth effects of equipment investment primarily to learning-by-doing effects, citing historical examples developed by, among others, my late Stanford University colleague Nathan Rosenberg.
The potential outsize beneficial economic effects were developed in a classic paper by another late Stanford University colleague (and Summers’s uncle), Nobel laureate Kenneth Arrow.
If increased investment leads to new technologies or improvements via learning that generate further technological advances, it will have a disproportionally larger growth effect.
I personally think there is something to be said for learning by doing.
Consider hydraulic fracturing, the marginal cost of which has been halved in just the past decade, owing to experiments with new technologies and techniques.
And my own research (with Stanford University’s Lawrence J. Lau) on growth in G7 countries suggests that the realized rate of technical progress rises with more capital.
A fourth point is that while Summers and DeLong’s academic work suggests that equipment investment should be subsidized, and structures taxed more heavily, Summers and Furman want expensing to be extended to structures – which are more likely to be debt-financed – as well as a smaller reduction in the corporate-tax rate.
It is Summers’ prerogative to offer proposals that depart from his earlier work.
I, too, revise my positions in accordance with changes in the economy and subsequent research – and much has changed since Summers and DeLong presented their research.
Global competition for investment, including lower corporate-tax rates among US competitors, seems to have strengthened the case for lowering the US statutory rate, which, at 39% (including state taxes), is the highest in the OECD, more than 50% above the average.
The effective rate, which accounts for credits and deductions, is also high, but less anomalous.
In an analysis of recent academic research, Oxford University’s Michael Devereux finds that while marginal effective tax rates affect the level of business investment, the average effective rate has a much larger effect on where, internationally, investments are made.
If he is right, then expensing and a higher tax rate – implying a low marginal and high average rate – would not be the best way to increase investment in the United States.
My own role aside, I believe that the current reform may well have deviated further from the ideal had we not offered our analysis and advice.
The same was true when I and others were advising President Ronald Reagan and congressional leaders on the major tax reforms of 1981 and 1986.
Many factors other than economists’ textbook policy proposals affect the final product.
Finally, I would emphasize the related point that the actual tax provisions people and businesses will be required to use have yet to be written, and will be determined partly by technical interpretations and regulations in the coming months.
In the case of the 1986 reform, I was still getting calls from Committee staff weeks after it had passed, asking me what exactly I thought was meant by this or that provision.
No one should expect this time to be different.
Reagan’s Tax Reforms Revisited
WASHINGTON, DC – Congressional Republicans must, President Donald Trump has commanded, pass their sweeping US tax bill by Christmas.
Otherwise, they will have no major accomplishment to show for an entire year during which they have controlled the legislative and executive branches of government.
Having apparently failed in their seven-year campaign to deprive millions of Americans of health insurance, they dare not fail in their Scrooge-like campaign to transfer billions of dollars from the middle class to the ultra-rich.
In an effort to rally support for the tax bill, Trump recently sought to invoke Ronald Reagan’s tax initiatives of the 1980s.
And he has a point, though not the one he intended. Recalling what transpired under Reagan might shed some light on the Republicans’ murky current proposals.
There were actually two huge tax bills during the Reagan years – the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 and the Tax Reform Act of 1986 – and they differed in almost every respect.
The 1981 legislation was not true tax reform, but a rushed and poorly coordinated frenzy of fiscally irresponsible cuts to both corporate and personal income taxes.
The 1986 law was the well-thought-out result of an extended, deliberate, and bipartisan process, designed to be revenue-neutral, with low marginal income tax rates balanced by fewer deductions, particularly on the corporate side.
The 1986 reform was a model of how to carry out fiscal reform, whereas the 1981 process was a model to avoid.
Yet it is the latter that the Republicans’ current tax “reform” most resembles.
As in 1981, the current process has been rushed, with scant deliberation – the usual hearings have not been held – and not even a pretense of bipartisan cooperation.
Almost every day brings news of some radical change in the legislation proposed in either the House of Representatives or the Senate.
The situation is so volatile that we may not know everything the bill contains – and which special interests won out – until after it is passed.
It goes without saying that thorough deliberation is essential to good legislation, not just to secure the political buy-in of others, but also to avoid drafting errors and limit unintended consequences.
Moreover, fiscally responsible reforms involve hard choices, and tend to work only if they are drafted with a spirit of shared sacrifice: “I will give up my cherished benefit, if you give up yours.”
Far from pursuing careful deliberation and smart compromise, US Republicans today are pretending that the cuts for which they are striving will carry no costs.
If they get their way, these self-professed fiscal conservatives will blow up the budget deficit, just as they did in 1981 under Reagan, and just as they did again in 2001 and 2003, thanks to the massive tax cuts enacted under President George W. Bush.
To be sure, the current proposals do not get everything wrong.
Reducing the US corporate income tax rate would be a good move, provided that the lost revenue were recouped through the elimination of business loopholes, such as the corporate interest deduction and the favored treatment of carried interest.
But the legislation cuts the corporate tax rate too much and closes too few loopholes to achieve anything close to revenue neutrality.
But Reagan’s 1986 reform prioritized working families over corporations, such as through the expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit.
The current proposed legislation does the opposite.
It aims to achieve its supposedly restrained goal of limiting revenue losses to $1.5 trillion over ten years by allowing households’ tax cuts to expire before the decade is over, while corporations enjoy their cuts indefinitely.
Taxes on families earning less than $75,000 would rise, on average, relative to today.
Of course, today’s Republicans do not admit that their plan isn’t revenue-neutral.
Like their counterparts in 1981, not to mention during the Bush era, they claim that the cuts will stimulate the economy so much that overall tax receipts will stay the same or even rise.
Yet such claims have been rejected by virtually all mainstream economists, including the economic advisers of both Reagan and Bush.
Those administrations implemented their cuts anyway – and, as economists had warned, budget deficits increased sharply.
The tax cuts that the Trump Republicans are attempting to pass today would be even more damaging.
There is good reason to fear much more serious long-term consequences of the rise in the budget deficit, owing to two key issues of timing – one cyclical and the other demographic.
The 1981 tax cuts went into effect at the onset of the 1981-1982 recession, a time when some short-term fiscal stimulus came in handy.
The opposite is true today.
With a 4.1% unemployment rate, the US economy does not need more stimulus.
In fact, the US Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates again in December, to prevent the economy from overheating.
Moreover, the baby boom generation is now retiring at a rate of about 10,000 people per day, meaning that Medicare and Social Security outlays – for health insurance and pensions, respectively – will increase rapidly.
Despite the slowdown in the growth of per capita health-care costs in recent years, the Medicare trust fund is projected to be depleted by 2029, and the Social Security trust fund by 2034.
Meanwhile, the national debt held by the US public stands at 76% of GDP, compared to just 25% when Reagan took office and 46% when George H.W. Bush left office 12 years later.
Total national debt, including bonds held by the Fed, stands at 104% of GDP today, compared to only 31% in 1980.
In short, this is the wrong time to be increasing the budget deficit and borrowing more – particularly with interest rates set to rise further.
The US has much experience with irresponsible tax cuts.
Yet its leaders seem not to have learned their lesson.
Should Republicans secure the legislative victory they desire, the entire country – with the exception, probably, of the wealthiest few – will lose.
Cutting US Corporate Tax Is Worth the Cost
CAMBRIDGE – The United States Congress is close to enacting a major tax reform. The plan’s most important provision reduces the corporate tax rate from 35% to 20% – from the highest among all OECD countries to one of the lowest – and allows US companies to repatriate the profits of their foreign subsidiaries without paying additional US taxes.
Opponents of the legislation point to the resulting increase in the federal budget deficit, which will add $1.5 trillion to the government debt over the next ten years.
I dislike budget deficits, and I have long warned about their dangerous effects.
Nonetheless, I believe that the economic benefits resulting from the corporate tax changes will outweigh the adverse effects of the increased debt.
The lower rate will attract capital to the US corporate sector.
American corporations will invest more in the US, because foreign countries will no longer offer lower tax rates, and will repatriate profits earned by their foreign subsidiaries rather than leaving them abroad.
They will also bring back some of the previously earned foreign profits that have been left outside the US, estimated by the Treasury to be worth $2.5 trillion.
Foreign companies will expand their investments in the US – or even shift their operations there – to take advantage of the lower tax rate.
And within the US, capital will flow from agriculture and housing to higher productivity uses in the corporate sector.
Although it is difficult to estimate the total increase in capital in the corporate sector, I think it is reasonable to assume that over the next ten years it will reach at least $5 trillion.
The increased flow of capital to the corporate sector will raise productivity and real wages.
If that happens, it will raise annual real GDP in 2027 by about $500 billion, equivalent to 1.7% of total 2027 GDP, implying a gain of $4,000 per household in today’s dollars.
These favorable effects are directly relevant to balancing the primary adverse effects usually associated with a fiscal deficit: that government borrowing crowds out private capital formation; that higher interest payments generally require higher taxes or reductions in spending on defense and nondefense programs; that a budget deficit implies an unwanted increase in aggregate demand when the economy is at full employment; and that a higher debt ratio leaves less capacity for increased emergency government spending.
I believe that none of these problems will materialize during the coming decade.
Let’s consider them in turn.
Although the $1.5 trillion of government borrowing caused by the tax bill during the next decade could crowd out an equal amount of private borrowing, the capital stock will grow by an even larger amount.
The $1.5 trillion corporate tax cut will go directly to US companies, and the stock of corporate capital will grow further because of the inflow of funds from the rest of the world.
Even with increased government borrowing, the proposed tax reform can therefore still raise the corporate capital stock by some $5 trillion over the next decade.
Moreover, the $500 billion increase in total annual income by 2027 would increase tax revenue by $100-150 billion a year.
That is enough to cover the $60 billion in interest payments on the $1.5 trillion of extra debt, with money left over to increase government spending or reduce personal taxes.
Likewise, concern that an increase in the fiscal deficit would undesirably stimulate aggregate demand is misplaced.
In fact, the stimulative effects of the fiscal deficit and increased corporate investment should be welcomed, for two reasons. First, they will offset the contractionary effects of the expected increase in the federal funds rate and the shrinking size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet.
And, second, after nine years of economic expansion, most experts expect the US to enter recession sometime in the next five years.
Similarly, concern about the ratio of government debt to GDP, which has doubled in the past decade and is now 77%, is exaggerated.
The Congressional Budget Office projects that even with no further legislation, the debt ratio will rise to 91.2% by 2027.
The direct effect of the $1.5 trillion deficit implied by the tax reform would be to raise that to 97%.
A military emergency or an economic downturn would call for additional debt-financed spending or tax reductions.
But even a massive spending program like the $900 billion American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 would add only an additional three percentage points to the debt ratio.
It is hard to believe that a debt ratio of 97% would make that more difficult to achieve than a debt ratio of 92%.
So, for all four of these reasons, I believe that the benefits of cutting the corporate tax rate more than offset the adverse effects normally attributed to budget deficits.
But, looking ahead, I believe that reducing the fiscal deficit should be a high priority after the 2018 congressional election.
A tax on carbon dioxide emissions or a slowdown of spending growth for federal entitlement programs can start to bring the debt ratio back down toward the 50% level that prevailed before the 2008-2009 downturn.
But first it is important to enact the proposed tax reform.
Déjà Voodoo
NEW YORK – Having failed to “repeal and replace” the 2010 Affordable Care Act (“Obamacare”), US President Donald Trump’s administration and the Republican congressional majority have now moved on to tax reform.
Eight months after assuming office, the administration has been able to offer only an outline of what it has in mind.
But what we know is enough to feel a deep sense of alarm.
Tax policy should reflect a country’s values and address its problems.
And today, the United States – and much of the world – confronts four central problems: widening income inequality, growing job insecurity, climate change, and anemic productivity growth.
America faces, in addition, the need to rebuild its decaying infrastructure and strengthen its underperforming primary and secondary education system.
But what Trump and the Republicans are offering in response to these challenges is a tax plan that provides the overwhelming share of benefits not to the middle class – a large proportion of which may actually pay more taxes – but to America’s millionaires and billionaires.
If inequality was a problem before, enacting the Republicans’ proposed tax reform will make it much worse.
Corporations and businesses will be among the big beneficiaries, a bias justified on the grounds that this will stimulate the economy.
But Republicans, of all people, should understand that incentives matter: it would be far better to reduce taxes for those companies that invest in America and create jobs, and increase taxes for those that don’t.
After all, it is not as if America’s large corporations were starved for cash; they are sitting on a couple of trillion dollars.
And the lack of investment is not because profits, either before or after tax, are too low; after-tax corporate profits as a share of GDP have almost tripled in the last 30 years.
Indeed, with incremental investment largely financed by debt, and interest payments being tax-deductible, the corporate tax lowers the cost of capital and the returns to investment commensurately.
Thus, neither theory nor evidence suggests that the Republicans’ proposed corporate tax giveaway will increase investment or employment.
The Republicans also dream of a territorial tax system, whereby American corporations are taxed only on the income they generate in the US.
But this would only reduce revenue and further encourage American companies to shift production to low-tax jurisdictions.
A race to the bottom on corporate taxation can be prevented only by imposing a minimum rate on any corporation that engages in business in the US.
America’s states and municipalities are responsible for education and large parts of the country’s health and welfare system.
And state income taxes are the best way to introduce a modicum of progressivity at the subnational level: states without an income tax typically rely on regressive sales taxes, which impose a heavy burden on the poor and working people.
It is thus perhaps no surprise that the Trump administration, staffed by plutocrats who are indifferent to inequality, should want to eliminate the deductibility of state income taxes from federal taxation, encouraging states to shift toward sales taxes.
Addressing the panoply of other problems confronting the US will require more federal revenues, not less.
Increases in standards of living, for example, are the result of technological innovation, which in turn depends on basic research.
But federal government support of research as a percentage of GDP is now at a level comparable to what it was 60 years ago.
While Trump the candidate criticized the growth of US national debt, he now proposes tax cuts that would add trillions to the debt in just the next ten years – not the “only” $1.5 trillion that Republicans claim would be added, thanks to some growth miracle that leads to more tax revenues.
Yet the key lesson of Ronald Reagan’s “voodoo” supply-side economics has not changed: tax cuts like these do not lead to faster growth, but only to lower revenues.
This is especially so now, when the unemployment rate is just over 4%.
Any significant increase to aggregate demand would be met by a corresponding increase in interest rates.
The “economic mix” of the economy would thus shift away from investment; and growth, already anemic, would slow.
An alternative framework would increase revenues and boost growth.
It would include real corporate-tax reform, eliminating the tricks that allow some of the world’s largest companies to pay miniscule taxes, in some cases far less than 5% of their profits, giving them an unfair advantage over small local businesses.
It would establish a minimum tax and eliminate the special treatment of capital gains and dividends, compelling the very rich to pay at least the same percentage of their income in taxes as other citizens.
And it would introduce a carbon tax, to help accelerate the transition to a green economy.
Tax policy can also be used to shape the economy.
In addition to offering benefits to those who invest, carry out research, and create jobs, higher taxes on land and real-estate speculation would redirect capital toward productivity-enhancing spending – the key to long-term improvement in living standards.
An administration of plutocrats – most of whom gained their wealth from rent-seeking activities, rather than from productive entrepreneurship – could be expected to reward themselves.
But the Republicans’ proposed tax reform is a bigger gift to corporations and the ultra-rich than most had anticipated.
It avoids necessary reforms and would leave the country with a mountain of debt; the consequences – low investment, stalled productivity growth, and yawning inequality – would take decades to undo.
Trump assumed office promising to “drain the swamp” in Washington, DC.
Instead, the swamp has grown wider and deeper.
With the Republicans’ proposed tax reform, it threatens to engulf the US economy.
The Plot Against America’s 99%
NEW YORK – After multiple failed attempts to “repeal and replace” the 2010 Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), US President Donald Trump’s administration now hopes to achieve its first legislative victory with a massive tax giveaway that it has wrapped in the language of “tax reform.”
To that end, Republicans in the US Congress have just unveiled a bill that, if enacted, could vastly widen the deficit and increase the public debt by as much as $4 trillion over the next decade.
Worse still, the Republican plan is designed to funnel most of the benefits to the rich.
It would lower the corporate tax rate from 35% to 20%, reduce the tax on capital gains (investment profits), eliminate the estate tax, and introduce other changes that benefit the wealthy.
Like the Republicans’ health-care proposals, their tax plan offers little to struggling middle- and working-class households.
Trump continues to govern as a pluto-populist – a plutocrat pretending to be a populist – who has not hesitated to betray the people he conned into voting for him.
Before releasing the current plan, congressional Republicans passed resolutions to reduce taxes by $1.5 trillion over the next decade.
But the actual tax cut will likely be much larger.
The proposal to lower the corporate tax rate to 20%, for example, implies a $2.5 trillion tax cut, once other tax cuts in the plan are considered.
To keep the tax cuts below $1.5 trillion, one would have to keep the corporate rate at or above 28% and broaden the tax base.
To make up for this difference, the bill proposes a cap on the mortgage-interest deduction for homeowners, and on the deductibility of property tax, as well as eliminating other tax benefits for the middle class.
It would eliminate or cap the income-tax deduction for state and local taxes – again, squeezing the middle class to cover tax cuts for the rich.
The problem is that eliminating the state and local tax deduction would provide just $1.3 trillion in revenue over the next decade.
And because this change would hurt middle-income families, many Republicans in high-tax states such as New York, New Jersey, and California will oppose it.
If congressional Republicans and the Trump administration end up keeping the state and local tax deduction, their tax cuts will add $3.8 trillion to the public debt over the next decade.
Moreover, Republicans want their tax cuts to be permanent.
Yet they are trying to enact their bill through the congressional budget reconciliation process, which requires any tax cuts that add to the deficit after ten years to be temporary.
Even if the Republican plan really did keep the cuts at $1.5 trillion, it still would not comply with this rule.
Trump and congressional Republicans argue that tax cuts will boost economic growth, and thus revenues.
But standard dynamic scoring models show that increased growth would offset the cost by only one third, at most: the US would face $1 trillion, rather than $1.5 trillion, in lost revenues.
So, how will the Republicans fudge these fiscal rules?
For starters, like President George W. Bush’s administration, they will set the personal income tax cuts to expire after ten years.
This will give them plenty of time to enjoy the political gains of tax cuts – starting with the midterm elections in 2018 – long before the bill comes due.
But corporate tax cuts are another matter, because making them temporary would defeat the purpose.
Companies operate with a much longer time horizon than households, and are unlikely to boost investment in response to cuts that last only ten years.
To get around this problem, Trump and the Republicans might decide to bend or manipulate congressional rules.
Or they might rely on unorthodox and untested economic models to claim that their cuts actually are revenue-neutral, and will have a much larger impact on growth than what standard models project.
Most mainstream economists would estimate that a tax cut of the size being proposed would increase US potential growth by 20 basis points, at most, taking the growth rate from around 2% to 2.2% over time.
Yet Trump and his advisers have clung to the false claim that growth will increase to 3% or even 4%.
If this far-fetched projection sounds like voodoo economics all over again, that’s because it is.
Voodoo economics came into parlance in the 1980 presidential election, when George H. W. Bush criticized Ronald Reagan for claiming that his planned tax cuts would pay for themselves.
Bush was vindicated just a few years later, when the Reagan administration’s tax cuts blew a huge hole in US public finances.
And yet Republican administrations have persisted in pursuing unsustainable and undesirable tax cuts benefiting primarily the rich, leading to ever-larger deficits and trillions of dollars of additional public debt.
The Republicans’ eagerness to pass reckless tax cuts once in power gives the lie to their claims of fiscal rectitude.
Making matters worse, America’s pluto-populist president is peddling a tax plan that will further increase economic inequality at a time when income and wealth gaps are already widening, owing to the effects of globalization, trade, migration, new labor-saving technologies, and market consolidation in many sectors.
Given that the rich tend to save more than middle- and working-class people, who must spend a larger proportion of their incomes on basic necessities, the Trump tax plan will do little for economic growth; it may even decrease it.
And it will add far more to the US’s excessively high public-debt burden.
It is fake reform, brought to us by an alt-fact administration and a party that has lost its economic bearings.
Rescuing Europe’s Illiberal Democracies
BRUSSELS – After 1989, the West, buoyed by political theorist Francis Fukuyama’s seductive notion of the “end of History,” entered an era of self-satisfied complacency in which it seemed that liberal democracy and capitalism could be taken for granted.
Three decades later, History is back with a vengeance.
A populist nationalist is now president of the United States.
The United Kingdom is withdrawing from the European Union.
And self-proclaimed illiberal democrats are in power in Hungary and Poland.
It turns out that, at the “end” of history, the enemies of open, democratic societies never actually surrendered.
They were just pushed into the shadows.
There are a number of sociological reasons why illiberalism is resurgent today.
Across the West, once-universal public spheres have been weakened and divided, and once-public social concerns have been “privatized.”
But the main reason for the West’s illiberal turn concerns emotions.
For those who are unsettled by the widespread change of the past few decades, national identities have become increasingly appealing as a way to offset often-unpredictable globalization.
Populist rhetoric poses a direct challenge to the EU and its tradition of procedural and rules-based governance.
Indeed, it strikes at the very core of the European project.
There is no European counterpart to Trump’s promise to “Make America Great Again.”
Given Europe’s twentieth-century history, such parochial sloganeering has been all but banished from the continent’s politics.
Indeed, it is not well suited to the European timbre.
Yet the fact remains that Europeans are fighting for their very soul.
To resist the populist backlash, we Europeans should be proclaiming the EU’s virtues more loudly, without descending to the populists’ level.
Conjuring up some kind of EU-level nationalism to compete with state-level nationalism would be akin to taking medicine that is worse than the disease.
A better approach would focus on defending the rule of law against populist encroachments.
The rule of law is the EU’s most valuable currency and a fundamental part of its DNA.
It provides the foundation for the philosophy of multinational democracy that animates the EU’s institutions.
While populists regard the rule of law as malleable or negotiable, Europe’s democrats understand that it is the essential bond holding our civilization together.
As Europe attempts to reverse the slide toward illiberalism, we must recognize that not all illiberal trajectories are the same.
It seems counterproductive to put Hungary and Poland into one basket, and thereby drive them even further into an “alliance of the scorned” fueled more by convenience than real common interests.
The European project is about integration, not isolation.
We should be careful about punishing countries simply because they happen to be led by irresponsible leaders at any given moment.
In fact, European integration must be about people, not political elites.
Regardless of their governments’ stance, the majority of people in Poland and Hungary want to remain in the EU and participate actively in its continent-wide community.
The EU is an expression of their values, and a mechanism by which they can realize their dreams.
That means EU leaders have a responsibility, but also an opportunity, to turn back the illiberal tide.
If we are to draw in the countries with illiberal regimes, we could foster the active support of civil society, while using precise and calibrated instruments to put pressure on the governments in question.
Blunt instruments will only make matters worse.
For example, cutting off EU structural funds for regional development or other forms of assistance would punish the Polish and Hungarian people instead of their leaders, pushing them further away from the EU, and into the arms of their illiberal governments.
The challenge facing the EU today is to figure out how to reengage with its backsliding member states without punishing voters for their leaders’ misdeeds.
It will not be easy.
But if the EU is to implement needed institutional reforms, we need all the member countries to be fully engaged in seeking common solutions that make Europe more competitive, equitable, and socially robust.
For those of us who believe in Europe, good-faith engagement is the only acceptable option.
The R&D Road to Development
COPENHAGEN – When famine strikes, governments and international donors step in with life-saving aid.
And rich countries give more than $130 billion each year not only to feed the starving, but also to build crucial infrastructure and reduce gaps in access to education, health care, and clean water and sanitation worldwide.
All of this is vitally important.
But one of the most powerful investments the development community could make is not in today’s problems, but in research that will address tomorrow’s challenges.
A dollar spent on research and development has been shown consistently to deliver some of the highest social benefits of any form of policy intervention.
More spending on R&D would avoid many of the typical concerns expressed in donor countries about “funding corruption.”
And there are large gaps in the knowledge base that research could close.
This requires charting new territory beyond popular research topics like alternative energy and vaccines.
Consider hunger.
There is no question that donors must continue to provide a safety net for fragile countries.
But we need a longer-term view, one that looks beyond today’s crisis or tomorrow’s headlines.
Research conducted for the Copenhagen Consensus, the think tank I direct, shows that investing less than $88 billion in agricultural R&D worldwide from now to 2050 would increase yields everywhere by an additional 0.4 percentage points annually.
The bumper crops and lower food prices that result from this would save 79 million people from hunger.
The benefits, added up, would be worth $3 trillion.
Every dollar spent on research would generate a return of $34.
There are other areas where major donors could make a huge difference.
The Copenhagen Consensus has studied the best R&D opportunities, and the results have just been published by the British Policy Exchange think tank.
The results are relevant not only for the United Kingdom, which since 1995 has spent just 0.9% of its aid on R&D, but for every donor country as well.
We worked with 32 top global academics and subject experts to identify nearly 100 research ideas that would fast-track the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals, and 40 projects for which a first-order estimate of potential benefits and costs could be calculated.
Of these, we believe that ten deserve to be at the forefront of the development agenda.
One idea is research into cleaner cooking stoves.
Indoor air pollution caused by cooking and heating is one of the world’s biggest environmental killers: household air pollution killed 2.9 million people in 2015, and the annual costs from the health effects are estimated at approximately $333 billion.
Spending just $25 million annually to create stoves that better fit household cooking habits, and identifying how to maximize community-wide adoption of cleaner cooking solutions, would likely improve uptake of clean stoves by 10-20%, suggesting that approximately 60,000 to 120,000 lives could be saved every year.
The benefits would be worth 250-500 times the cost.
Intimate partner violence is another issue that requires significant R&D development spending.
More than 300 million women per year are victims, with the annual social cost reaching a staggering $4.4 trillion.
There is a need for a particular focus on working with African countries, where the prevalence of violence is highest and governments have the fewest resources to address the problem.
Research costs are estimated at approximately $100 million per year – a substantial sum, but one justified by the complexity and sheer size of the challenge.
There is emerging evidence that teenage education programs might be effective in reducing the burden of intimate partner violence, and this and other approaches need to be tested in different contexts.
Our researchers estimate that doing so could yield $45-450 of benefits for every dollar spent.
A third idea is to research more affordable asthma treatments.
Asthma is largely under control in developed countries, but inhalers remain expensive and generally unaffordable for the poor.
A relatively small outlay of $10 million could generate breakthroughs that would help millions, possibly yielding benefits of as much as $600 for every dollar invested.
For HIV, the focus has been on pre-exposure prophylaxis and on developing a vaccine.
But one under-explored area is the development of cheaper home monitoring and drug delivery for people living with the virus.
This would reduce the need for regular medical visits and for repeat prescriptions, enabling better self-management and higher therapy-adherence rates.
Spending just about $10 million each year would generate benefits worth more than 20 times the costs.
Likewise, spending as little as $10 million per year on research into developing a long-acting, reversible contraceptive could transform millions of lives, by providing enhanced control over childbearing, while empowering women, boosting labor-market participation, and improving health.
In economic terms, the benefits could be worth well over $3 billion annually.
The other top-ten ideas from our researchers are: expanding the potential for irrigation in Sub-Saharan Africa; developing a marketable “polypill” for hypertension and cardiovascular disease; researching ways to introduce successful tobacco taxes in developing countries; conducting action research – a particular approach and type of research that involves a high level of engagement between researchers and practitioners; and improving the ability of customs offices to identify illicit transactions.
Past research by the Copenhagen Consensus, at both the global and national level, has conclusively shown that R&D can be an extraordinarily good investment for aid donors.
The case for prioritizing such investments is no less compelling.
Reviving India’s Economy
NEW YORK – Not long ago, India was a poster child for political stability and economic growth among emerging economies.
Though the country had a long way to go to eradicate poverty and extreme inequality, when it came to steady GDP growth, it was among the world’s strongest and most consistent performers.
Not anymore.
In the second quarter of 2017, India’s growth rate fell to 5.7%.
It is now tied with Pakistan – behind China, Malaysia, and the Philippines – on the list of major economies for which The Economist provides basic economic data.
Neighboring Bangladesh, which is not on that list, is now growing at over 7% per annum (and Bangladesh’s per capita income now exceeds Pakistan’s).
Given the Indian economy’s massive size and extensive global linkages, its growth slowdown is a source of serious concern not just domestically, but around the world.
But it is not too late for India to reverse the trend. The key will be carefully crafted policies that address both short- and long-term challenges.
In the short term, policymakers must address declining demand for Indian products, both among domestic consumers and in export markets.
All signs point to falling consumer and business spending in India.
In fact, India’s index of industrial production grew by a meager 1.2% in July, compared to 4.5% a year earlier.
Output of consumer durables fell by 1.3%; a year earlier, it grew by 0.2%.
Meanwhile, annual export growth has fallen in recent years to just 3%, compared to 17.8% in 2003-2008, India’s rapid-growth phase.
This is partly a result of a stronger rupee, which has raised the price of Indian goods in foreign markets.
And, indeed, imports have risen sharply as well, as the rupee’s appreciation lowers the relative price of foreign goods: in the first half of this year, nominal merchandise imports grew by 28%.
But there is another potential driver of the sharp rise in imports: people may be over-invoicing, in order to shift money abroad.
This could indicate that big traders expect a correction in the rupee’s exchange rate, at which point they plan to sell the dollars that they are now accumulating for a larger sum of rupees.
This possibility should worry the Indian authorities – and spur them into action.
To boost domestic demand in the short term, India needs Keynesian interventionist policies.
To mitigate the rupee’s appreciation, thereby boosting external demand, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) – one of India’s most respected institutions, populated by qualified professionals – must be given greater policy space and autonomy.
My advice would be for the RBI to lower interest rates further, thereby aligning India’s monetary policy more closely with that of the world’s other major economies.
While the current tendency toward very low interest rates is not ideal from a global perspective, the fact is that as long as India remains an outlier, it will encourage the so-called carry trade, which artificially drives up the rupee’s value.
The bigger challenge facing India will be to nurture and sustain rapid growth in the long run.
To figure out how to achieve that, it is worth considering the efforts of another major emerging economy: China.
As part of its industrial policy, China’s government has identified specific economic sectors to boost.
India can adopt a similar approach, with health and education being two particularly promising sectors.
Despite its success, India’s medical tourism industry still has plenty of untapped potential – not least because health-care costs are rising around the world.
The income earned from such tourism could help the country to shore up its own health system, ensuring that all Indians – including the poor and especially children, among whom malnourishment remains rampant – have access to quality health care.
Likewise, India can become a hub for higher education.
For the government, the imperative is to create more regulatory space and provide a facilitating ethos for the private sector.
An education boom would bring huge returns for the entire Indian economy.
The final piece of India’s long-term growth puzzle is investment more broadly.
The experience of East Asian countries, not to mention economic theory, shows that capital investment is among the most effective drivers of sustained economic growth.
Even in India, the sharp uptick in growth from 2003 occurred alongside a surge in overall investment.
Yet India’s investment-to-GDP ratio is now slipping, from over 35% in the last eight years to below 30% today.
This can be explained partly by an increase in risk aversion among banks, which are concerned about non-performing assets.
Falling business confidence may also be a factor.
If India implements policies that boost short-term growth, while laying the groundwork for long-term performance, confidence should rise naturally.
Once investment picks up, India will be able to recapture its past rapid growth – and sustain it in the coming years.
That outcome would benefit not just India, but the entire global economy.
In Search of Convergence
CAMBRIDGE – One puzzle of the world economy is that for 200 years, the world’s rich countries grew faster than poorer countries, a process aptly described by Lant Pritchett as “Divergence, Big Time.”
When Adam Smith wrote The Wealth of Nations in 1776, per capita income in the world’s richest country – probably the Netherlands – was about four times that of the poorest countries.
Two centuries later, the Netherlands was 40 times richer than China, 24 times richer than India, and ten times richer than Thailand.
But, over the past three decades, the trend reversed.
Now, the Netherlands is only 11 times richer than India and barely four times richer than China and Thailand.
Spotting this reversal, the Nobel laureate economist Michael Spence has argued that the world is poised for The Next Convergence.
Yet some countries are still diverging.
While the Netherlands was 5.8, 7.7, and 15 times richer than Nicaragua, Côte D’Ivoire, and Kenya, respectively, in 1980, by 2012 it was 10.5, 21.1, and 24.4 times richer.
What could explain generalized divergence in one period and selective convergence in another?
After all, shouldn’t laggards grow faster than leaders if all they have to do is imitate others, even leapfrogging now-obsolete technologies? Why didn’t they grow faster for so long, and why are they doing so now?
Why are some countries now converging, while others continue to diverge?
There are potentially many answers to these questions.
But I would like to outline a possible explanation that, if true, has important implications for development strategies today.
The economic expansion of the last two centuries has been based on an explosion of knowledge about what can be made, and how.
An apt metaphor is a game of Scrabble: Goods and services are made by stringing together productive capabilities – inputs, technologies, and tasks – just as words are made by putting letters together.
Countries that have a greater variety of capabilities can make more diverse and complex goods, just as a Scrabble player who has more letters can generate more and longer words.
If a country lacks a letter, it cannot make the words that use it.
Moreover, the more letters a country has, the greater the number of uses it could find for any additional letter it acquired.
This leads to a “quiescence trap,” which lies at the heart of the Great Divergence.
Countries with few “letters” lack incentives to accumulate more letters, because they cannot do much with any additional one: you would not want a TV remote control if you didn’t have a TV, and you would not want a TV broadcasting company if your potential customers lacked electricity.
This trap becomes deeper the longer the alphabet and the longer the words.
The last two centuries have seen an explosion in technologies – letters – and in the complexity of goods and services that can be made with them.
So the techies get techier, and the laggards fall further behind.
Why, then, are some poorer countries now converging?
Is the technological alphabet getting shorter?
Are products getting simpler?
Obviously not.
What is happening is that globalization has split up value chains, allowing trade to move from words to syllables.
Now, countries can get into business with fewer letters and add letters more parsimoniously.
It used to be that if you wanted to export a shirt, you had to be able to design it to the taste of people you didn’t really know, procure the appropriate materials, manufacture it, distribute it through an effective logistical network, brand it, market it, and sell it.
Unless you performed all of these functions well, you would go out of business.
Globalization allows these different functions to be carried out in different places, thereby allowing countries to participate earlier, when they still have few locally available capabilities, which can then be expanded over time.
A recent example is Albania.
Known as the North Korea of Europe until the early 1990s, when Albania abandoned its quixotic quest for autarky, it started cutting and sowing garments and shoes for Italian manufacturers, gradually evolving its own fully integrated companies.
Other countries that started in garments – for example, South Korea, Mexico, and China – ended up reusing the accumulated letters (industrial and logistical capabilities) while adding others to move into the production of electronics, cars, and medical equipment.
Consider this a stylized version of the sale of IBM’s Thinkpad to China’s Lenovo.
Once upon a time, IBM asked a Chinese manufacturer to assemble its Thinkpad – using the components that it would supply and following a set of instructions – and send the final product back to IBM.
A couple of years later, the Chinese company suggested that it take responsibility for procuring the parts.
Later, it offered to handle international distribution of the final product.
Then it offered to take on redesigning the computer itself.
Soon enough, it was no longer clear what IBM was contributing to the arrangement.
Learning to master new technologies and tasks lies at the heart of the growth process.
If, while learning, you face competition from those with experience, you will never live long enough to acquire the experience yourself.
This has been the basic argument behind import-substitution strategies, which use trade barriers as their main policy instrument.
The problem with trade protection is that restricting foreign competition also means preventing access to inputs and knowhow.
Participating in global value chains is an alternative way to learn by doing that is potentially more powerful than closing markets to foreign competition.
It enables a parsimonious accumulation of productive capabilities by reducing the number of capabilities that need to be in place in order to get into business.
This strategy requires a highly open trade policy, because it requires sending goods across borders many times.
But this does not imply laissez-faire; on the contrary, it requires activist policies in many areas, such as education and training, infrastructure, R&D, business promotion, and the development of links to the global economy.
Some dismiss this strategy, arguing that countries end up merely assembling other people’s stuff.
But, as the famous astronomer Carl Sagan once said: “If you want to make an apple pie from scratch, you must first invent the universe.”
Another Nobel Surprise for Economics
NEW HAVEN – The winner of this year’s Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, Richard Thaler of the University of Chicago, is a controversial choice.
Thaler is known for his lifelong pursuit of behavioral economics (and its subfield, behavioral finance), which is the study of economics (and finance) from a psychological perspective.
For some in the profession, the idea that psychological research should even be part of economics has generated hostility for years.
Not from me. I find it wonderful that the Nobel Foundation chose Thaler.
The economics Nobel has already been awarded to a number of people who can be classified as behavioral economists, including George Akerlof, Robert Fogel, Daniel Kahneman, Elinor Ostrom, and me.
With the addition of Thaler, we now account for approximately 6% of all Nobel economics prizes ever awarded.
But many in economics and finance still believe that the best way to describe human behavior is to eschew psychology and instead model human behavior as mathematical optimization by separate and relentlessly selfish individuals, subject to budget constraints.
Of course, not all economists, or even a majority, are wedded to this view, as evidenced by the fact that both Thaler and I have been elected president, in successive years, of the American Economic Association, the main professional body for economists in the United States.
But many of our colleagues unquestionably are.
I first met Thaler in 1982, when he was a professor at Cornell University.
I was visiting Cornell briefly, and he and I took a long walk across the campus together, discovering along the way that we had similar ideas and research goals.
For 25 years, starting in 1991, he and I co-organized a series of academic conferences on behavioral economics, under the auspices of the US National Bureau of Economic Research.
Over all those years, however, there has been antagonism – and even what appeared to be real animus – toward our research agenda.
Thaler once told me that Merton Miller, who won the economics Nobel in 1990 (he died in 2000), would not even make eye contact when passing him in the hallway at the University of Chicago.
Miller explained his reasoning (if not his behavior) in a widely cited 1986 article called “Behavioral Rationality in Finance.”
Miller conceded that sometimes people are victims of psychology, but he insisted that stories about such mistakes are “almost totally irrelevant” to finance.
The concluding sentence of his review is widely quoted by his admirers: “That we abstract from all these stories in building our models is not because the stories are uninteresting but because they may be too interesting and thereby distract us from the pervasive market forces that should be our principal concern.”
Stephen A. Ross of MIT, another finance theorist who was a likely future Nobel laureate until he died unexpectedly in March, argued along similar lines.
In his 2005 book Neoclassical Finance, he, too, eschewed psychology, preferring to build a “methodology of finance as the implication of the absence of arbitrage.”
In other words, we can learn a lot about people’s behavior just from the observation that there are no ten-dollar bills lying around on public sidewalks.
However psychologically bent some people are, one can bet that they will pick up the money as soon as they spot it.
Both Miller and Ross made wonderful contributions to financial theory.
But their results are not the only descriptions of economic and financial forces that should interest us, and Thaler has been a major contributor to a behavioral research program that has demonstrated this.
For example, in 1981, Thaler and Santa Clara University’s Hersh Shefrin advanced an “economic theory of self-control” that describes economic phenomena in terms of people’s inability to control their impulses.
Sure, people have no trouble motivating themselves to pick up a ten-dollar bill that they might find on a sidewalk. There is no self-control issue there.
But they will have trouble resisting the impulse to spend it.
As a result, most people save too little for their retirement years.
Economists need to know about such mistakes that people repeatedly make.
During a long subsequent career, involving work with UCLA’s Shlomo Benartzi and others, Thaler has proposed mechanisms that will, as he and Harvard Law School’s Cass Sunstein put it in their book Nudge, change the “choice architecture” of these decisions.
The same people, with the same self-control problems, could be enabled to make better decisions.
Improving people’s saving behavior is not a small or insignificant matter.
To some extent, it is a matter of life or death, and, more pervasively, it determines whether we achieve fulfillment and satisfaction in life.
Thaler has shown in his research how to focus economic inquiry more decisively on real and important problems.
His research program has been both compassionate and grounded, and he has established a research trajectory for young scholars and social engineers that marks the beginning of a real and enduring scientific revolution.
I couldn’t be more pleased for him – or for the profession.
Speaking to the Far Right
NEW YORK – Something many right-wing populists have in common is a peculiar form of self-pity: the feeling of being victimized by the liberal media, academics, intellectuals, “experts” – in short, by the so-called elites.
The liberal elites, the populists proclaim, rule the world and dominate ordinary patriotic people with an air of lofty disdain.
This is in many ways an old-fashioned view.
Liberals, or leftists, do not dominate politics any more.
And the influence that great left-of-center newspapers, like The New York Times, once had has long been eclipsed by radio talk-show hosts, rightwing cable TV stations, tabloid newspapers (largely owned by Rupert Murdoch in the English-speaking world), and social media.
Influence, however, is not the same thing as prestige.
The great newspapers, like the great universities, still enjoy a higher status than the more popular press, and the same goes for higher learning.
TheSun or Bild lack the esteem of the Financial Times or the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, and evangelical colleges in rural parts of the US cannot compete in terms of cachet with Harvard or Yale.
Social status arouses more envy and resentment in our populist age than money or fame do.
President Donald Trump, for example, is a very wealthy man, who was more famous than any of his rivals for the US presidency, including Hillary Clinton.
And yet he seems to be in an almost permanent rage against people who have greater intellectual or social prestige than he does.
The fact that he shares this resentment with millions of people who are much less privileged goes a long way toward explaining his political success.
Until recently, figures on the extreme right had no prestige at all.
Driven to the margins of most societies by collective memories of Nazi and fascist horrors, such men (there were hardly any women) had the grubby air of middle-aged patrons of backstreet porno cinemas.
Stephen Bannon, still a highly influential figure in Trump’s world, seems a bit like that – a crank in a dirty raincoat.
But much has changed.
Younger members of the far right, especially in Europe, are often sharply dressed in tailor-made suits, recalling the fascist dandies of pre-war France and Italy.
They don’t shout at large mobs, but are slick performers in radio and TV studios, and are savvy users of social media.
Some of them even have a sense of humor.
These new-model rightists are almost what Germans call salonfähig, respectable enough to move in high circles.
Overt racism is muted; their bigotry is disguised under a lot of smart patter.
They crave prestige.
I had occasion to encounter a typical ideologue of this type recently at an academic conference organized by the Hannah Arendt Center at Bard College in the United States.
The conference was about populism, and the ideologue was named Marc Jongen, a politician from the far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) party with a doctorate in philosophy.
The son of a Dutch father and an Italian mother, born in Italy’s German-speaking South Tyrol, Jongen spoke near-perfect English.
Self-pity lay close to the surface.
Jongen described Chancellor Angela Merkel’s decision to give shelter in Germany to large numbers of refugees from Middle Eastern wars as “an act of violence” toward the German people.
He called immigrants and refugees criminals and rapists (even though crime rates among refugees in Germany are far lower than among “natives”).
Islam was robbing the German Volk of its true identity.
Men like Jongen were always being called Nazis.
And so on.
I had been asked to furnish some counterarguments.
I did not call Jongen a Nazi.
But I did my best to point out why I thought his claims were both wrong and dangerous.
We shook hands at the end.
And that, as far as I was concerned, was that.
Then a minor academic storm broke out.
More than 50 distinguished US academics signed a letter protesting the Hannah Arendt Center’s decision to invite Jongen to speak.
The point was not that he didn’t have the right to express his opinions, but that Bard College should not have lent its prestige to make the speaker look respectable.
Inviting him to speak made his views seem legitimate.
This strikes me as wrongheaded for several reasons.
First of all, if one is going to organize a conference on right-wing populism, it is surely useful to hear what a right-wing populist actually has to say.
Listening to professors denouncing ideas without actually hearing what they are would not be very instructive.
Nor is it obvious that a spokesman for a major opposition party in a democratic state should be considered out of bounds as a speaker on a college campus.
Left-wing revolutionaries were once a staple of campus life, and efforts to ban them would rightly have been resisted.
The protest against inviting Jongen was not only intellectually incoherent; it was also tactically stupid, because it confirms the belief of the far right that liberals are the enemies of free speech, and that right-wing populists are victims of liberal intolerance.
I like to think that Jongen left the Bard conference politely discredited.
Because of the protest, he was able to snatch victory from defeat.
The Rentiers Are Here
GENEVA – Since the 2008 financial crisis, policymakers and international institutions have regularly expressed concerns about widening income inequality and its unwelcome political consequences.
More often than not, they attribute the problem to “exogenous” factors such as global trade and new technologies.
While policymakers have intensified their focus on trade and new technologies, they have missed an even more potent driver of inequality: the endemic rent-seeking that stems from market concentration, heightened corporate power, and regulatory capture.
Rent, broadly defined, is income derived solely from the ownership and control of an asset, rather than from innovative, entrepreneurial deployments of economic resources.
When the British economist John Maynard Keynes anticipated the “euthanasia of the rentier” in his 1936 book The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money, he was referring to a financial class that served no purpose other than to exploit scarce capital for its own benefit.
But over the last three decades, financial rentiers have taken their revenge.
Through private credit creation and financial alchemy, they have amassed huge gains that are wildly disproportionate to the social return of their activities.
Moreover, in our age of hyper-globalization, large non-financial corporations have also emerged as a rentier class.
Owing to their substantial market power and lobbying prowess, they now regularly engage in the kind of rent-seeking activities that were once the exclusive preserve of the financial industry.
As a result, large non-financial firms have become a pervasive source of rising income inequality.
Non-financial corporations have entered the rent-seeking game through a number of channels.
They have systematically abused intellectual-property laws to achieve market domination, rather than to protect genuine innovations.
They have looted public-sector resources through large-scale privatization schemes, and by securing public subsidies that rarely require them to deliver benefits to taxpayers.
And they have engaged in far-reaching market manipulation, by turning themselves into debt collectors, using share buy-backs to boost executive remuneration, and so forth.
In addition to the sheer range of rent-seeking schemes operating today, lax corporate reporting requirements around the world make it difficult to estimate the scale of the problem.
Much of the existing research focuses on the US economy, where some studies have measured the growth of dominant firms’ market power through the steep upward trend in mark-up pricing; and others have examined the role of proliferating information technologies in the accumulation of “surplus wealth.”
At the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), our research looks beyond the US economy, relying on a newly constructed database for publicly traded companies in 56 developed and developing countries.
We used these data to estimate the extent to which large non-financial corporations’ profits exceeded typical annual sectoral profit performance since 1995.
Surplus profits, we found, rose markedly over the past two decades, from 4% of total profits in 1995-2000 to 23% in 2009-2015.
For the top 100 firms, that share increased from 16% to 40%, on average.
The same multi-country database also confirms that market concentration has risen significantly over the past two decades, particularly among the top 100 firms.
In fact, large inter-firm disparities have become a key feature of the corporate rent-seeking age.
In 2015, the top 100 firms had a combined market capitalization (the total value of a company’s outstanding shares) that was 7,000 times that of the bottom 2,000 firms. Twenty years ago, that multiple was just 31.
Making matters worse, this trend has not extended to employment.
Between 1995 and 2015, the top 100 firms increased their market capitalization fourfold, but did not even double their share of employment.
This implies that market concentration and corporate rent-extraction are feeding off one another.
The result is a “winner-takes-most” market environment that strongly disadvantages start-ups, entrepreneurial innovation, and sustained creation of high-quality jobs.
Consider, for example, the proliferation of wide-ranging patent-protection powers through bilateral and multilateral trade and investment agreements. These powers have been extended to new activities that were not previously considered areas of technological innovation, such as finance and business methods.
As a result, the tech giants, in particular, have achieved a new level of regulatory capture, allowing them to limit free speech when it serves their interests, expand into non-high-tech markets, and shape emerging global policy agendas, such as financial inclusion and e-commerce.
It is not too late to check the trend toward rentier capitalism.
The “endogenous” factors contributing to wide-scale regulatory capture and corporate rentierism can be addressed with stronger antitrust legislation, policies to empower organized labor, revisions to existing trade agreements, and better monitoring, at the international level, of transfer pricing and tax evasion.
Some policymakers have already started to take action on these fronts.
But success will require a more concerted effort. It is time to force big business back into the business of productive investment and job creation.
The Evolving Independent Economy
BERKELEY – Working full-time for a single employer is no longer the norm in advanced economies.
Instead, millions of “independent workers” – self-employed, freelance, or temporary employees – sell their labor, services, and products through digital platforms to numerous employers or clients.
The growing share of independent work, which typically entails flexible hours, promises to bring significant aggregate economic gains, by raising labor-force participation rates, increasing the overall number of hours worked, and reducing unemployment.
But the “gig economy” also creates complex new policy challenges in taxation, regulation, and access to social benefits and protections that traditionally have been provided through standard employer-employee relationships.
According to a McKinsey Global Institute study, up to 162 million people throughout the United States and the EU-15 are currently engaged in some form of independent work.
Based on a representative online survey of 8,000 workers in six countries (including the US), McKinsey found that 10-15% of the working-age population relies on independent work for their primary income.
Another 10-15% – including students, retirees, household caregivers, and those with traditional jobs – take on such work to supplement their income.
McKinsey’s findings challenge several common beliefs about independent work.
First, the independent workforce is not dominated by young people: people under age 25 represent just 25% of independent workers.
The independent workforce is also diverse in terms of income level, education, gender, occupation, and industry.
Moreover, 70-75% of those engaged in independent work do so by choice, rather than out of necessity – a finding that is consistent with the results of other recent studies.
Indeed, although 40-55% of low-income workers (earning $25,000 or less per year) engage in some independent work, they comprise less than 25% percent of all independent earners.
Only about one-third of survey respondents said they rely on independent work because they cannot find conventional jobs or need supplemental income to make ends meet.
That minority, however, still amounts to a large number of people.
It is estimated that more than 50 million Americans and Europeans are engaged in independent work out of necessity, and more than 20 million rely on independent work as their primary source of income.
Many are low-income workers who would otherwise be unemployed.
This suggests that stronger economic – and, thus, employment – growth would reduce the number of workers engaged in independent work.
But, regardless of macroeconomic conditions, independent work is likely to account for a rising share of work in the long run, owing to technological advances and individual preferences.
While digital platforms for independent work are still in the early stages of their development, and are being used by only 15% of independent workers, they are proliferating and expanding rapidly.
McKinsey estimates that 30-45% of the working-age population would prefer to earn an income, whether primary or secondary, from independent work.
That trend poses challenges and opportunities for policymakers, workers, and employers.
Policymakers need to collect better data on the independent workforce through regular surveys.
They must also update how independent workers are categorized, in order to adapt taxation, regulation, and benefits and protections (including anti-discrimination laws and minimum wages) accordingly.
The policy issues for high-skill professionals acting as independent agents are not the same as those for low-skill workers selling their services through large digital platforms like Uber.
Updating the provision and delivery of benefits may be particularly challenging.
Some European countries are tackling the issue by creating new classifications of work, with new benefit systems.
British law distinguishes between traditional employees and “workers,” who are entitled to only some employee rights.
In the US, there is a growing interest in a system of portable, pro-rated benefits – such as unemployment and disability insurance and pensions – tied to workers, rather than employers.
Another option in the US would be new unions or collective organizations (guilds) of workers, both to negotiate the terms of independent-work contracts and to track and organize benefits for workers who serve many clients and employers.
Similar systems are already in place for the construction and entertainment industries.
Entrepreneurs also have opportunities to create new products and services tailored to the needs of the independent workforce.
These could include shared office spaces, financial solutions that smooth out income between work assignments, training programs, and the creation of widely recognized credentials to enable independent workers to advance their work and income opportunities.
Employers, for their part, will need to learn when to rely on internal talent and when to turn to independent workers.
Many factors will influence that decision, including cost, quality, productivity, and the security of proprietary information.
Finally, there is the responsibility of workers themselves to assert more control over their own careers, seeking opportunities and developing differentiated skills to avoid being relegated to a low-wage generalist talent pool or displaced by intelligent machines.
This may prove to be the most important element of the emerging labor-market transformation: workers are a driving force behind it.
Of course, digital technologies have also played a vital role in facilitating the rise of independent work.
Digital platforms like Airbnb, Etsy, and Uber have been critical in reducing the friction and increasing the transparency of the markets that support independent work.
And innovation in this area remains robust.
But it is these platforms’ users who are really reshaping the labor market.
Aided by digital technologies, they are advancing their own interest in earning more, while benefiting from more flexible working arrangements.
The likely result of this trend will be a shift from the old model of business organization – in which most workers carry out specialized functions for a single employer within a rigid hierarchy – to one centered on lean core organizations that rely on a loose network of external providers for many tasks.
Whether this new system is actually good for workers, employers, and economies, however, will depend on how all of the relevant actors address the challenges inherent in the transition.
Myanmar’s Jihadi Curse
NEW DELHI – Myanmar’s military has lately been engaged in a brutal campaign against the Rohingya, a long-marginalized Muslim ethnic minority group, driving hundreds of thousands to flee to Bangladesh, India, and elsewhere.
The international community has rightly condemned the crackdown.
But, in doing so, it has failed to recognize that Rohingya militants have been waging jihad in the country – a reality that makes it extremely difficult to break the cycle of terror and violence.
Rakhine State, where most of Myanmar’s Rohingya reside, is attracting jihadists from far and wide.
Local militants are suspected of having ties with the Islamic State (ISIS), al-Qaeda, and other terrorist organizations.
Moreover, they increasingly receive aid from militant-linked organizations in Saudi Arabia and Pakistan.
The main insurgent group – the well-oiled Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army, also known as Harakah al-Yaqin – is led by a Saudi-based committee of Rohingya émigrés.
The external forces fomenting insurgent attacks in Rakhine bear considerable responsibility for the Rohingyas’ current plight.
In fact, it is the links between Rohingya militants and such external forces, especially terrorist organizations like ISIS, that have driven the government of India, where some 40,000 Rohingya have settled illegally, to declare that their entry poses a serious security threat.
Even Bangladesh acknowledges Rohingya militants’ external jihadi connections.
But the truth is that Myanmar’s jihadi scourge is decades old, a legacy of British colonialism.
After all, it was the British who, more than a century ago, moved large numbers of Rohingya from East Bengal to work on rubber and tea plantations in then-Burma, which was administered as a province of India until 1937.
In the years before India gained independence from Britain in 1947, Rohingya militants joined the campaign to establish Pakistan as the first Islamic republic of the postcolonial era.
When the British, who elevated the strategy of “divide and rule” into an art, decided to establish two separate wings of Pakistan on either side of a partitioned India, the Rohingya began attempting to drive Buddhists out of the Muslim-dominated Mayu peninsula in northern Rakhine.
They wanted the Mayu peninsula to secede and be annexed by East Pakistan (which became Bangladesh in 1971).
Failure to achieve that goal led many Rohingya to take up arms in a self-declared jihad.
Local mujahedeenbegan to organize attacks on government troops and seize control of territory in northern Rakhine, establishing a state within a state.
Just months after Myanmar gained independence in 1948, martial law was declared in the region; government forces regained territorial control in the early 1950s.
But Rohingya Islamist militancy continued to thrive, with mujahedeen attacks occurring intermittently.
In 2012, bloody clashes broke out between the Rohingya and the ethnic Rakhines, who feared becoming a minority in their home state.
The sectarian violence, in which rival gangs burned down villages and some 140,000 people (mostly Rohingya) were displaced, helped to transform the Rohingya militancy back into a full-blown insurgency, with rebels launching hit-and-run attacks on security forces.
Similar attacks have lately been carried out against security forces and, in some cases, non-Rohingya civilians, with the violence having escalated over the last 12 months.
Indeed, it was a wave of coordinated predawn insurgent attacks on 30 police stations and an army base on August 25 that triggered the violent military offensive that is driving the Rohingya out of Rakhine.
Breaking the cycle of terror and violence that has plagued Myanmar for decades will require the country to address the deep-seated sectarian tensions that are driving Rohingya toward jihadism.
Myanmar is one of the world’s most ethnically diverse countries.
Its geographic position makes it a natural bridge between South and Southeast Asia, and between China and India.
But, internally, Myanmar has failed to build bridges among its various ethnic groups and cultures.
Since independence, governments dominated by Myanmar’s Burman majority have allowed postcolonial nativism to breed conflict or civil war with many of the country’s minority groups, which have complained of a system of geographic apartheid.
The Rohingya face the most extreme marginalization.
Viewed as outsiders even by other minorities, the Rohingya are not officially recognized as one of Myanmar’s 135 ethnic groups.
In 1982, the government, concerned about illegal immigration from Bangladesh, enacted a law that stripped the Rohingya of their citizenship, leaving them stateless.
Successive governments have defended this approach, arguing that past secessionist movements indicate that the Rohingya never identified as part of the country.
And, in fact, the common classification of Rohingya as stateless “Bengalis” mirrors the status of Rohingya exiles in the country of their dreams, Pakistan, where tens of thousands took refuge during the Pakistani military genocide that led to Bangladesh’s independence.
Still, the fact is that Myanmar’s failure to construct an inclusive national identity has allowed old ethnic rivalries to continue to fuel terrorism, stifling the resource-rich country’s potential.
What Myanmar needs now is an equitable, federalist system that accommodates its many ethnic minorities, who comprise roughly a third of the population, but cover half of the total land area.
To this end, it is critical that Myanmar’s military immediately halt human-rights abuses in Rakhine.
It will be impossible to ease tensions if soldiers are using disproportionate force, much less targeting civilians; indeed, such an approach is more likely to fuel than quell violent jihadism.
But as the international community pressures Myanmar’s de facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi to take stronger action to protect the Rohingya, it is also vital to address the long history of Islamist extremism that has contributed to the ethnic group’s current plight.
Gimme Shelter From Dictatorship
NEW YORK – Following US President Barack Obama’s trailblazing visit to Cuba, a free concert by the Rolling Stones in Havana might seem like a relatively minor event.
Obama revived relations with Cuba after more than a half-century of deep hostility.
The septuagenarian Stones just played some very loud music.
And yet, symbolically, the concert was not minor at all.
To grasp the importance of the Stones’ performance in front of hundreds of thousands of adoring Cubans, one has to understand what rock and roll meant to people living under Communist dictatorships.
In the 1970s, for example, Czechoslovakia, like other Communist states, was a dreary, oppressive, joyless place, where mediocre party hacks set the tone, and creativity was stifled under a blanket of enforced conformism.
Rock and roll was considered a noxious form of capitalist decadence.
A local rock band named Plastic People of the Universe, performing in English, was arrested in the late 1970s for “organized disturbance of the peace.”
Recordings by the Rolling Stones and other Western groups were banned.
And yet records were smuggled into Czechoslovakia and other Eastern European countries, where they were treasured by young rock fans, including the dissident playwright Václav Havel, who would later become the country’s president.
The forbidden sounds – loud, anarchic, sexy – offered an escape from the drabness of a tightly policed normality.
Rock and roll allowed people to imagine what it would be like to be free, if only for fleeting moments.
For that reason, the authorities viewed it as profoundly subversive.
Rock fans in Western democracies listened to groups like the Rolling Stones, the Velvet Underground, or Frank Zappa’s Mothers of Invention, for pleasure.
There was a certain amount of political bluster among rock stars, to be sure, but this was widely regarded as frivolous posturing.
Not in countries like Czechoslovakia, where the music – more than the posturing – was an expression of serious rebellion.
Indeed, the defense of the Plastic People of the Universe became a public cause for dissidents like Havel, ultimately giving rise to Czechoslovakia’s Charter 77 movement.
When Havel offered Zappa an official role in his democratic government after the Communist regime had fallen, Zappa was as astonished as everyone else.
But it showed how much his music had meant to people like Havel, when they had to listen to it secretly, risking arrest.
The role of rock music in countries behind the Iron Curtain was beautifully dramatized in Tom Stoppard’s 2006 play Rock ‘n’ Roll, in which a Havel-like character, named Ferdinand (after characters of the same name in Havel’s own plays), extolls the music as a supreme form of political resistance.
Other people in the play scoff at this notion, treating musical subversion as trivial.
Stoppard, like Havel, clearly doesn’t agree.
The play ends with the Rolling Stones’ historic concert in Prague in 1990.
Rock is ecstatic music.
Ecstasy allows people to let go of themselves.
This is not always benign.
Mass hysteria at Nazi rallies was a form of ecstasy too.
So is the behavior of soccer crowds, which can sometimes turn violent.
I once witnessed a group of highly respectable Singaporeans letting go of themselves in an evangelical church service.
Urged on by an excited Japanese preacher, men in grey suits started writhing on the floor, foaming at the mouth, and jabbering nonsense.
It was not an edifying spectacle.
In fact, it was frightening.
But the Japanese preacher was not wrong to claim that people – especially, as he put it to his congregation, buttoned-up Japanese and Singaporeans – sometimes need a relief from everyday conformity.
Music-induced ecstasy is not the same as speaking in tongues in a religious frenzy.
But the experiences are related.
That is why official guardians of social order are so often eager to ban such practices.
Indeed, as far back as 380 BC, Plato warned against departing from traditional forms of music.
Musical innovation, he wrote in The Republic, and especially exciting new sounds, were a danger to the polis.
He believed that lawlessness began with unorthodox kinds of musical entertainment, and advised the authorities to put a stop to such things.
Last month, Mick Jagger told his Cuban fans in Spanish that “finally the times are changing.”
Perhaps they are.
Obama struck a similar note in his farewell speech in Havana.
He spoke about a new era, “a future of hope.”
He told Raúl Castro, the stiff-legged Cuban strongman, who is more than a decade older than Jagger and almost three decades older than Obama, that he should not fear freedom of speech.
These are fine words.
But real political freedom in Cuba may be slow to come.
And the example of China shows that individual hedonism can be successfully combined with political authoritarianism.
(The Stones have already played in Shanghai, even though the Chinese authorities insisted on vetting their songs.)
But it is a start.
Rock and roll has officially come to Cuba.
Jagger paid proper respect to Cuba’s own ecstatic musical traditions.
Cubans already know how to dance.
The next, much bigger step is for the autocrats to get off the floor.
The Iranian Opportunity
MADRID – Last week, the people of Iran decided to continue along the path toward openness.
Fifty-seven percent of voters chose to elect the reformist President Hassan Rouhani to a second term.
The rest of the world should welcome Rouhani’s victory as an opportunity further to improve relations with a country that is central to progress toward a more peaceful Middle East.
By winning more than 50% of the vote, Rouhani avoided a second round of voting, just as he did four years ago when he claimed the presidency for the first time.
But, unlike in 2013, when his overwhelming victory was a major surprise, most observers considered Rouhani the clear favorite this time around.
After all, every Iranian president since 1981 has served two terms in office.
Rouhani’s triumph was likely, but the vote was no mere formality.
His main opponent, the hardline conservative Hojatoleslam Ebrahim Raisi, campaigned hard – and had Iran’s Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, implicitly in his corner.
Rouhani’s victory has proven once again that the candidate closest to the supreme leader is not guaranteed victory.
The stakes of this election were particularly high.
Iran is at a pivotal moment in its history – and, as the long lines of citizens eager to cast their votes clearly showed, Iranians know it.
Indeed, despite the Iranian regime’s lack of transparency, Khamenei’s health problems are public knowledge.
Khamenei himself recently admitted that the probability that his successor should be named in the near future was “not low.”
The matter of who occupies the presidency during that transition is certainly not inconsequential.
With Khamenei having served as president before rising to Iran’s highest political and religious leadership position, it is easy to see that the conservative candidate Raisi, had he been elected, could have become Khamenei’s successor.
Rouhani’s decisive victory, however, may have diminished Raisi’s chances substantially.
Iran’s prospects look quite different with Rouhani in charge.
His rhetoric about openness is not mere political posturing.
Perhaps the strongest evidence of this is the nuclear deal that he struck with six countries – China, France, Germany, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States – and the European Union in 2015.
That agreement placed very strict limits on Iran’s nuclear program, in exchange for relief from crippling economic sanctions imposed by the US, the European Union, and the United Nations Security Council.
To be sure, Iran’s president is subordinate to the Supreme Leader.
And, indeed, the nuclear agreement could not have been reached without Khamenei’s approval, which helps explain why no candidate questioned the deal during the campaign.
Nonetheless, the president does wield significant authority, including over domestic policy, which was the main focus of the campaign (as is usually the case in Iran).
In particular, Rouhani and Raisi attempted to distinguish themselves by their very different interpretations of the nuclear agreement’s domestic economic impact.
Rouhani credited the agreement with jump-starting economic growth, which now stands at around 7% annually.
His detractors, however, claimed that this growth mainly reflected higher oil exports, and pointed out that it has not trickled down to all levels of society, leaving many Iranian households still suffering from poverty and unemployment.
Khamenei, too, has been very critical of Rouhani’s economic policy, calling for a much more autarkic approach.
But Rouhani’s interpretation of Iran’s challenges is far more convincing.
Increased openness has, in fact, greatly benefited Iran.
What is holding the country back are the remaining barriers surrounding its economy, including Iran’s isolation from the global financial system, which contributes to a chronic and damaging shortage of credit.
The bad news is that US President Donald Trump, who opposed the nuclear deal during his campaign, and the Republican-dominated US Congress have taken a hardline stance toward Iran, and are discouraging investment in the country.
This gives political succor to those who accuse Rouhani of being naive to hope that the international community would welcome a more open Iran.
Among these skeptics are the conservatives Raisi represented, who regard the West with suspicion.
Had Raisi won, mutual distrust between the US and Iran could well have boiled over, despite Raisi’s stated support for the nuclear deal.
Rouhani’s victory, however, might help temper the Trump administration’s anti-Iran rhetoric.
Just a few weeks ago, in fact, the administration was forced to admit that Rouhani is fulfilling its part of the nuclear deal.
Indeed, Iranians’ show of popular support for Rouhani provides the best guarantee that the spirit behind the nuclear deal will remain unchanged.
But Trump won’t make it easy for Rouhani.
In order to ensure that Iran continues progressing toward international engagement – thereby protecting a nuclear agreement that Trump is not eager to defend – Rouhani’s government will have to work hard to improve relations with neighboring countries.
Moreover, it will need to adopt a more constructive position vis-à-vis the Syrian conflict, making it clear that Iran is not spearheading a Shia liberation movement.
On the day Iranians went to the polls, Trump was making his way to Saudi Arabia – a remarkable choice for his first official foreign trip.
Let us hope that his brief visit to the Middle East helps to create favorable conditions for progress toward peace in the region.
Iran has sent a powerful signal on that front.
It is an opportunity that should not be squandered.
Europe’s Rule-of-Law Crisis
BRUSSELS – From the rubble of two world wars, European countries came together to launch what would become the world’s largest experiment in unification and cooperative, shared sovereignty.
But, despite its impressive achievements over the decades, the European project now risks disintegration.
An unresolved financial crisis, a refugee crisis, a deteriorating security environment, and a stalled integration process have created throughout Europe a toxic, unstable political environment in which populism and nationalism thrive.
Perhaps the clearest manifestation of this is the erosion of the rule of law in the European Union.
Two EU members in particular, Hungary and Poland, are now jeopardizing hard-won European democratic norms – and thus undermining the very purpose of European integration.
In Hungary, liberal-democratic values have come under systematic attack from Prime Minister Viktor Orbán’s government.
Since his return to the premiership in 2010, Orbán has committed Hungary to an authoritarian nationalist path, and he has exploited the refugee crisis to cement a “siege mentality” that helps him sustain popular support.
In the process, fundamental rights have been ignored, media freedom has been curbed, refugees have been demonized, and Orbán is doing everything in his power to weaken the EU.
Attempts by EU institutions to convince Orbán to change course have only emboldened him to commit further outrages against democratic norms.
Meanwhile, a democratic crisis has emerged in Poland as well, starting last October, when the Law and Justice (PiS), a Euroskeptic party that also opposes immigration, secured an outright parliamentary majority by promising to implement populist economic policies and “put Poland first.”
Yet, since the election, PiS has launched a series of attacks on the Polish constitution itself.
Government legislation aimed at reforming Poland’s Constitutional Court has been condemned by the Court itself and the European democracy watchdog, the Venice Commission.
The government has effectively precluded the Court from ruling on the constitutionality of legislation.
This weakens a key pillar of the democratic rule of law – and thus is highly problematic for Poland and Europe alike.
Hungary and Poland are the leading edge of a far-right agenda that has taken hold throughout Europe, pursued by parties that are exploiting the political vacuum created by the EU’s failure to address the financial and refugee crises.
So how can the tables be turned?
In democratic countries, it is vital that democracy’s enemies be fought with democratic means.
It is vital that the outside world impress on the Hungarian and Polish people themselves that in a globalized world, nationalism offers only false security and economic irrelevance.
Both countries, at the heart of Europe, have profited enormously in every sense from EU membership; they must not throw away their opportunity to make further progress.
Hungarians and Poles rejected international isolation in 1989.
After the fall of the Iron Curtain, both countries became staunch NATO allies even before they joined the EU.
The geopolitical and security arguments for European unity are overwhelming, and there can be no united Europe without Hungary and Poland.
But all of us, and in particular the peoples of Hungary and Poland, must remember that NATO, like the EU, was founded on the fundamental principles of democracy, individual liberty, and the rule of law.
A government that flouts those principles jeopardizes the coherence and solidarity of the alliance.
It is therefore vital that the United States and other NATO allies speak out now and insist that functioning democratic checks and balances are safeguarded.
It would be unimaginable for NATO heads of state to go ahead with their planned leadership summit in Warsaw in June if Poland remains in its constitutional crisis, with the government disregarding the rule of law and the opinion of a respected international body.
Hungarians and Poles must be reminded that Russian President Vladimir Putin is actively attempting to divide and weaken the EU and NATO.
If Europe is to face down aggression from the Kremlin, it is essential that Poland and Hungary adhere to these groups’ fundamental values and principles.
But it is also necessary that the EU itself develop a more comprehensive mechanism for safeguarding the rule of law within the Union.
The EU has mechanisms to regulate economic policies, safeguard the environment, and police the Single Market.
But Europe has always been much more than an economic project; it is also a union of values, which no member can be allowed to repudiate without consequence.
Governments are created and fall apart, and politicians come and go; but democratic institutions should be spared from political interference.
The sad reality is that, were they to apply for EU membership today, neither Hungary nor Poland would be admitted.
Their people should weigh carefully what that means.
Their current leaders claim to be defending national interests. But is it really in their countries’ interest to be sidelined by the US, NATO, and the rest of Europe?
Guilty Man
NEW YORK – In 1940, with Britain standing alone against Nazi Germany, a short book called Guilty Men was published under the pseudonym of “Cato.”
Its authors were the future Labour Party leader Michael Foot, the Liberal journalist Frank Owen, and the Conservative journalist Peter Howard.
Guilty Men was a jeremiad that called to account the men – including Neville Chamberlain and Lord Halifax, then still members of Winston Churchill’s cabinet – whose appeasement of Adolf Hitler had helped to bring the United Kingdom to the brink of annihilation.
Today, it is again time to name names, and not only in the UK, where democracy is writhing with Brexit fever.
In the United States, a fetid paranoia has taken hold, with the white supremacist aggression in Charlottesville, Virginia over the August 12 weekend – where a peaceful counter-protester was killed and many were injured – just the latest manifestation.
President Donald Trump, no surprise, doesn’t want to name names.
It took him two days to condemn the racist groups that wreaked havoc in Charlottesville.
And then he quickly backtracked, equating the Klansmen and “alt-right” extremists brandishing swastikas and chanting Nazi slogans with those who turned out to oppose them.
In fact, Trump owes his presidency to the forces of rage and resentment on display in Charlottesville.
But while Trump has gleefully fanned the flames of hatred in the US, he did not kindle them, just as the Brexiteers did not do so in the UK.
We need to look beyond these figures to determine who really is responsible for fomenting a political climate where blatant lies and explicit racism and bigotry have entered the mainstream of public discourse.
Only when we identify the sources of the odious virus now afflicting our democracies can we take practical steps to quarantine them.
Let’s start with “patient zero” in this political plague: Rupert Murdoch.
For decades, this impresario of the right-wing political-entertainment complex has coarsened politics in the UK and the US – not to mention his native Australia – for the sake of profit and political influence.
Murdoch’s newspapers and television networks might as well have patented the recipe for the deceitful, dog-whistle politics that powered Trump’s rise and the Brexit vote.
Of what, precisely, is Murdoch guilty?
Let us put aside the ever-expanding roster of sexual harassment and assault complaints brought against his flagship Fox News Channel.
These have been so numerous and egregious that even the network’s founder, the late Roger Ailes, and its leading money-maker, the on-air blowhard Bill O’Reilly, finally (and reluctantly) had to be sacked.
Let us also put aside the scandalous hacking of private telephones in the UK, which culminated in the closure of Murdoch’s beloved tabloid The News of the World in 2011.
To establish Murdoch’s culpability, it is enough to focus solely on the recent record of lies and deception from Murdoch-owned media outlets.
There were, for example, the repeated attempts by Fox News to insinuate that the murder of Seth Rich, a young Democratic National Committee staffer, was orchestrated by Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign team to hide Rich’s alleged role in leaking internal DNC emails.
In fact, a recent lawsuit alleges that Fox News actually worked with the White House to promote this bogus story.
This was hardly the network’s only anti-Clinton invention.
Fox News host Sean Hannity and regular Fox commentator Newt Gingrich eagerly propagated one of the most bizarre conspiracy theories of our time: the claim that Clinton and her cohort were running a pedophilia ring out of a Washington, DC, pizzeria.
This truly nutty story led an armed man to enter the pizzeria and fire a rifle.
But that incident apparently gave neither Fox News nor its owner pause.
Instead, the network went on to perpetuate the outright lie that Britain’s intelligence-gathering agency, the Government Communications Headquarters (better known as GCHQ), had been tasked by President Barack Obama to spy on Trump during the campaign.
And it promoted the baseless story that former FBI Director James Comey, who Trump fired amid an intensifying investigation into his campaign’s potential collusion with Russia, had leaked classified memos.
Of course, the sins of Murdoch’s media outlets are not limited to the US.
To name one British example, the Murdoch-owned Sunday Times recently published a column by an Irish Holocaust denier repeating the old racist calumny that Jews love only money, while belittling women who work at the BBC for receiving lower pay – supposedly a result of their failure to assert themselves.
In any responsible press organization, the publication or broadcast of even one of these genuine examples of fake news would be grounds for dismissal of the editors responsible – not least because of investors’ outrage.
Yet Murdoch has continued to produce large enough profits to silence institutional shareholders such as the Vanguard Group, Fidelity Investments, and Franklin Templeton Investments.
Individual investors are equally complacent.
Consider Saudi Prince Al-Waleed Bin Talal, the second-largest shareholder of Fox News’s parent company.
He is apparently more interested in making money than pushing back against, say, the network’s propagation of incendiary claims about Muslims, including that they are trying to impose Sharia law on the US.
If markets cannot induce better behavior from Murdoch, it may be up to governments to step in.
With Murdoch seeking to acquire full control of Sky Television, British regulators have a critical opportunity to prevent a Fox News clone from appearing on British television screens – if they have the courage, which UK regulators have not shown up to now.
Previously, Murdoch and his sons were somehow deemed “fit and proper” owners for a UK television license.
But as the catalogue of lies that Fox has promoted in the first six months of the Trump presidency has demonstrated, there is no man more unfit for ownership of a media outlet in a democracy than Rupert Murdoch.
As a former citizen of a country – the Soviet Union – that was morally and politically corrupted by propaganda, I am well aware of the damage that can be done by weaponized “news.”
Murdoch is one of the truly guilty men of our times, and he must be stopped.
A Trip Through Putin Country
VLADIVOSTOK – Russia’s Baikal-Amur Mainline (BAM) railway “can be hardly named as a popular tourist attraction,” says one tourist website of the some 2,000-mile railway traversing Eastern Siberia and the Russian Far East.
“Most people even never [sic] heard of it.”
The BAM’s older rival, the Trans-Siberian Railway, is certainly more popular.
Since opening in 1916 it has attracted many big names, including the travel writers Peter Fleming, Paul Theroux, and Colin Thubron.
But it is the BAM – this unloved northern spur, initiated by Stalin in the 1930s, and completed under Leonid Brezhnev in 1984 – that offers the more useful window onto the Russian mood outside of cosmopolitan Moscow and St. Petersburg.
Today, BAM land is overwhelmingly Putin land.
I was inspired to take the BAM across Siberia by Dervla Murphy’s book, Through Siberia by Accident, even though Murphy, an intrepid Irish grandmother, broke a leg slipping in the train car’s primitive toilet.
I was further motivated by the fact that my great-grandfather had built the far-eastern section of the Trans-Siberian Railway in the 1890s, yet I had never been to its terminus, Vladivostok, where my father was born.
So three friends joined me on an improbable two-week railway adventure across Siberia.
The BAM – like the Motherland Calls statue in Volgograd, the eternal flames at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier and Victory Park in Moscow, and the giant hydroelectric plants that line the train’s route – is a symbol of the once-mighty Soviet Union.
It was the regime’s last great thrust into the Far East.
As Brezhnev put it, the BAM was “the construction project of the century,” pushing, cutting, and tunneling its way through thousands of miles of rivers, forests, and cliffs usually covered in permafrost.
Today, it endures in the mythology of the Soviet Union chiefly as a monument to collective effort.
Tynda is a typical BAM town.
Across from the station stands a statue of a heroic young woman enveloped in machinery; in the park lay an ancient engine; and beyond there, rows of featureless apartment blocks stretch into the distance.
A forlorn job application on a large signpost reads, “Nice girl, gentle without bad habits, will sell cement.”
The BAM museum in Severobaikalsk is full of mannequins and photographs of BAM workers, their medals, and the machinery they used, including the giant metal samovars in which they made their tea.
Pride of place goes to Fedor Fedorovich, the generic unsung hero whose task it was to prevent accidents by banging the rails and wagon couplings with a hammer to check for faults.
To Tatiana Nicolaevna Vetrova, the museum’s curator, the BAM was a symbol of unity.
The stations along its route – some quite striking – were built in the architectural style of the nations of the Soviet Union that had joined together to complete this mighty project.
I asked Tatiana whether the museum had a brochure for tourists. “There are many academic treatises on the subject,” she replied.
I persisted, requesting again a short guide for tourists, but she, too, was immovable, stating that there are too many facts to fit into a short space.
Finally, Tatiana sold me the story of BAM, written in verse, for 350 rubles ($6).
The railway was, the story said, “the roll-call of our youth.”
BAMovstsy (as the construction workers are called) did not make much money, nor did they expect to.
Instead – in an obvious criticism of capitalism – they worked for their country, and for one another.
“How to make friends as we did then, that is what we teach our children.”
The tone is overwhelmingly elegiac: back then, comrades came together to build a new world.
In Tatiana’s words, the BAM was “a labor of love and heroic sacrifice built by the dedicated workers, for the sake of their children and grandchildren.”
Like the Great Patriotic War of 1941-1945, the horrors fade, but the flame never dies.
Yet the horrors were plentiful.
Tatiana insisted that BAM construction was started in 1974, the politically correct date, after which “clean labor” was used.
But the railway’s first section – initiated by Stalin to offer an eastern route that ran farther away from the Chinese border – was built by forced labor, including Russian inmates and German and Japanese prisoners of war, herded together in so-called BAMlags, now ghost towns.
Even when volunteers were used, they were not nearly as enthusiastic as official accounts claim.
Lacking adequate housing and electricity, few re-enlisted, and many deserted before completing their term.
Nonetheless, the Brezhnev-era BAM construction showed what that dying Soviet system was still capable of achieving.
Indeed, the railway’s completion amounts to an asterisk on the conventional assessment of how decrepit the late Soviet Union really was.
The truth is that Siberian Russia – still home to 20-30 million Russians – benefited significantly more from the Soviet system than the European population centers did.
The heart of Russia, we were often told by those we met during our BAM journey, is rural, not urban.
In fact, the Soviet state sustained the Tsarist policy of subsidizing Russians to move east.
Only now are they returning to Europe, replaced partly by an influx of Chinese and Uzbeks.
Our journey on the BAM furnished poignant reminders of the region’s previous prosperity.
One that stuck in my memory was a deserted kolkhoz (collective farm) on Lake Baikal, which once thrived on fishing and fur.
The village, still inhabited and well maintained, consists of a few people growing vegetables, keeping chickens and the odd cow, and selling trinkets to visitors like me.
At the same time, rusting fishing boats line the shore like beached whales.
In the village, as we enjoyed a homemade lunch of soup and pancakes, our hostess praised Putin, whom she credited with restoring Russia to health after the Soviet Union’s disintegration.
“Why is the West so down on Russia?” one of our fellow travelers asked.
“Don’t they understand that a chaotic Russia is a much greater threat to the world than a united one?”
It is hard to get a hearing on international law in BAM land.
Putin’s Medieval Dreams
ATLANTA – While much of the world is busy dismantling monuments to oppressors, Russians are moving in the opposite direction, erecting statues to medieval warlords who were famous for their despotism.
Understanding this revival can shed light on the direction of Russia’s politics.
In October 2016, with the endorsement of Russia’s culture minister, Vladimir Medinsky, the country’s first-ever monument to Ivan the Terrible was unveiled in the city of Orel.
A month later, Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the leader of the ultra-nationalist Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, called for Lenin Avenue in Moscow to be renamed Ivan the Terrible Highway.
And in July of this year, President Vladimir Putin christened Moscow’s own tribute to the tyrant, declaring, erroneously, that “most likely, Ivan the Terrible never killed anyone, not even his son.”
Most historians agree that Ivan lived up to his name; not only did he kill his son and other relatives, he also ordered the oprichnina, the state-led purges that terrorized Russia from 1565 to 1572.
He also presided over Russia’s defeat in the Livonian War, and his misrule contributed to the Time of Troubles and the state’s devastating depopulation.
Joseph Stalin initiated the modern cult of Ivan the Terrible.
But, since the mid-2000s, Russia’s Eurasia Party – a political movement led by the pro-fascist mystic Alexander Dugin – has moved to position Ivan as the best incarnation of an “authentic” Russian tradition: authoritarian monarchy.
Dugin’s brand of “Eurasianism” advocates the embrace of a “new Middle Ages,” where what little remains of Russian democracy is replaced by an absolute autocrat.
In Dugin’s ideal future, a medieval social order would return, the empire would be restored, and the Orthodox church would assume control over culture and education.
Eurasianism, which was marginal in the 1990s, has gained considerable popularity in recent years by contributing to the formation of the so-called Izborsky Club, which unites the Russian far right.
On several occasions, Putin has referred to Eurasianism as an important part of Russian ideology; he has even invoked it as a founding principle of the “Eurasian Economic Union,” a burgeoning trade area of former Soviet states.
Eurasianism has given ultra-nationalist groups common ground around which to unite.
It has also given symbols of totalitarianism, like Ivan the Terrible and Stalin, new legions of support.
Chief among them are members of the Eurasia Party, who consider political terror the most effective tool of governance and call for a “new oprichnina” – a staunchly anti-Western Eurasian conservative revolution.
According to Mikhail Yuriev, a member of the political council of the Eurasia Party and author of the utopian novel The Third Empire, the oprichniks should be the only political class, and they should rule by fear.
Ivan the Terrible is not the only medieval vestige being revived in Russia.
Cultural vocabulary is also reverting.
For example, the word kholop, which means “serf,” is returning to the vernacular, a linguistic devolution that parallels a troubling rise in Russia’s modern slavery.
Data from the Global Slavery Index show that more than one million Russians are currently enslaved in the construction industry, the military, agriculture, and the sex trade.
Moreover, serf “owners” are also happily identifying themselves as modern-day barins.
Even Russian officials speak approvingly of modern slavery.
Valery Zorkin, who chairs the Constitutional Court, wrote in Rossiyskaya Gazeta, the official government newspaper, that serfdom has long been a “social glue” for Russia.
And another medieval term – lydi gosudarevy, which translates to “servants of his majesty” – has returned to favor among high-ranking bureaucrats.
Nostalgia for serfdom compliments the desire for a return to autocracy.
Prominent Russian intellectuals – including the filmmaker Nikita Mikhalkov, journalist Maksim Sokolov, and Vsevolod Chaplin, a Russian Orthodox cleric – call for the coronation of Putin, and petitions of support are gaining signatures online.
Significantly, the protests against Putin’s regime in 2012 have since been interpreted not as a protest against Putin himself, but rather against the social order to which Eurasianism aspires.
Putin’s tacit support for the Eurasian vision of a neo-medieval Russia invokes the historical memory of Stalinism.
According to Dugin, “Stalin created the Soviet Empire,” and, like Ivan the Terrible, expresses “the spirit of the Soviet society and the Soviet people.”
No wonder, then, that monuments to Stalin, too, are multiplying in Russian cities.
Neo-medievalism is rooted in nostalgia for a social order based on inequality, caste, and clan, enforced by terror.
The lionization of historical despots reflects the contemporary embrace of such pre-modern, radically anti-democratic and unjust values.
For Ivan’s contemporary champions, the past is prologue.
How Americans Became Vulnerable to Russian Disinformation
ATLANTA – As the United States marks the first anniversary of President Donald Trump’s election, the question of how Trump won still commands attention, with Russia’s role moving increasingly to center stage.
Each new revelation in the investigation of Russia’s meddling in the 2016 campaign brings the vulnerability of the US democratic process into sharper focus.
Last week, Congress unveiled legislation that would force Facebook, Google, and other social media giants to disclose who buys online advertising, thereby closing a loophole that Russia exploited during the election.
But making amends through technical fixes and public promises to be better corporate citizens will solve only the most publicized problem.
The tougher challenge will be strengthening institutions that are vital to the functioning of democracy – specifically, civics education and local journalism.
Until gains are made in these areas, the threat to America’s democratic process will grow, resurfacing every time the country votes.
Russian President Vladimir Putin’s intelligence operatives chose wisely in mounting their social media attack.
Facebook hosts nearly 80% of all mobile social media traffic, while Google accounts for close to 90% of all online-search-related advertising.
By inundating these two platforms with automated messages from tens of thousands of bogus user accounts, Russia was able to stoke discord along economic, racial, and political lines.
Moreover, they did it cheaply.
According to one analysis, with only modest ad purchases on Facebook, Russian agents gained access to a goldmine of online advertising data – such as Facebook’s customer targeting software – which enabled the “sharing” of Russia’s fake news hundreds of millions of times. At one point during this clandestine assault, an estimated 400,000 bots – software applications that run automated scripts – sent millions of fictitious political messages, which in turn generated some 20% of all Twitter traffic during the final month of the campaign.
It is bad enough that the technology world’s marquee names were not prepared to parry foreign meddling in America’s most important election.
But the social media giants’ persistent denial of responsibility for the volume of distorted and false information delivered as news, even as Russia’s role has grown clearer, is more troubling.
Strip away the technobabble about better algorithms, more transparency, and commitment to truth, and Silicon Valley’s “fixes” dodge a simple fact: its technologies are not designed to sort truth from falsehoods, check accuracy, or correct mistakes.
Just the opposite: they are built to maximize clicks, shares, and “likes.”
Despite pushing to displace traditional news outlets as the world’s information platforms, social media’s moguls appear content to ignore journalism’s fundamental values, processes, and goals.
It is this irresponsibility that co-sponsors of the recent advertising transparency bill are seeking to address.
Still, Russia’s success in targeting American voters with bogus news could not have succeeded were it not for the second problem: a poorly educated electorate susceptible to manipulation.
The erosion of civics education in schools, the shuttering of local newspapers – and the consequent decline in the public’s understanding of issues and the political process – conspire to create fertile ground for the sowing of disinformation.
Consider the evidence: In 2005, an American Bar Association survey found that 50% of Americans could not correctly identify the country’s three branches of government.
By the time the Annenberg Center for Public Policy asked the same question in 2015, the percentage of such respondents had grown to two thirds, and a staggering 32% could not name a single branch.
This slippage is apparently age-dependent; a 2016 study of Americans with university degrees found that those over 65 years of age know far more about how their government works than those under 34.
There is a clear correlation between democratic illiteracy and a de-emphasis on civics, government, and history education in schools.
In 2006, for example, a national study that tracks student performance in various subjects found that only a quarter of America’s 12th graders were proficient in civics.
A decade later, that percentage had sunk below 25%.
Not surprisingly, overall educational quality and access to basic civics coursework have also suffered in recent years.
In 2011, a think tank that ranks the 50 states on the rigor of their high schools’ US history courses gave 28 states failing grades.
A 2016 survey of 1,000 liberal arts colleges found that only 18% required a US history or government course to earn a degree.
High school or university courses by themselves will not keep gullible voters from falling for bogus news or inflammatory disinformation.
But the viral spread of fake news stories initiated by Russian agents made one thing clear: an electorate lacking a basic civics education is more likely to fall for provocations designed to inflame partisan tensions.
Changes in the news industry are increasing that risk.
As Internet giants siphon away advertising revenue from traditional media outlets, social media have become many people’s main source of news.
Traditional news organizations, especially local newspapers, are steadily disappearing, shrinking voters’ access to information that is vital to making informed political decisions.
The numbers are striking.
Since 2004, 10% of all small-market newspapers have closed or merged.
Of those that survive, over a third have changed ownership, concentrating the industry into fewer hands.
The result has been layoffs, cost-cutting, and diminished reporting on national and local issues.
As for the media’s civic responsibility, that, too, seems to have suffered.
The managers’ manual from one investment firm that owns three daily and 42 weekly newspapers does not mince words: “Our customer is the advertiser,” the document states.
“Readers are our customers’ customers,” so “we operate with a lean newsroom staff.”
Russia’s intervention in the 2016 US presidential election was historic, but it was also symptomatic of bigger challenges facing Americans.
A population that does not fully understand its own democracy should concern not only civics teachers, but national security experts as well.
The US didn’t need Putin to deliver that lesson.
“If a nation expects to be ignorant and free,” Thomas Jefferson warned, “it expects what never was and never will be.”
Russia’s Middle East Success
MADRID – After years on the sidelines, Russia is back at the center of the Middle East geostrategic game.
Against the background of an equivocal United States policy, Russia’s calculated intervention in the Syrian civil war is a rare case in which a limited use of power in the region resulted in a major diplomatic shakeup.
In a recent interview with Jeffrey Goldberg, US President Barack Obama revealed his thinking in a number of key foreign-policy areas, particularly the Middle East.
Cynically dismissive of both his European allies and his security advisers, including former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who supported military intervention in Syria, Obama minces no words in his fatalistic depiction of the troubled region.
According to Obama, there is little, if anything, America can do to stabilize the Middle East.
He even claimed to be proud of not enforcing the “red line” he had drawn in 2012 regarding Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s use of chemical weapons, as neither international law nor the US Congress would have sanctioned intervention.
That decision, Obama emphasized, enabled an agreement to remove, with Russian cooperation, most of Syria’s chemical-weapons stockpile.
But, as Goldberg points out, the decision not to enforce the red line with air strikes may also have caused the Middle East to “slip from America’s grasp.”
And, indeed, important strategic assets in the Middle East have been lost to unfriendly powers, from Russia to the Islamic State (ISIS).
Add to that the alienation of close allies, many of which doubt the ability and willingness of an Asia-fixated US to stand by them, and Obama’s suggestion that the US should not be focused on the Middle East is shocking.
Of course, a key motive for Obama’s reticence about engaging in the Middle East is fear of repeating the mistakes that left the US enmeshed in Afghanistan and Iraq – the result of what Obama called the US government’s unthinking “drift toward war in Muslim countries.”
But Putin has just proved that a military intervention in the Middle East does not have to lead to a quagmire.
In fact, far from fulfilling Obama’s pessimistic predictions, Russia’s Syrian operation may help drive forward a political settlement.
By refusing to be drawn into a long and costly war that would allow Assad to recover most of Syria’s territory, Putin has effectively created a deadlock, which forces both the regime and the opposition to engage seriously in the Geneva peace talks.
In this sense, says Monzer Makhous, a spokesman for the Syrian opposition, Russia’s decision to pull out “changes the entire situation.”
What would a political settlement look like?
One option, which Russia has championed, would be a federal system; indeed, the territorial divisions left behind by the Russians could form the basis of one.
Assad’s Alawites could control territory in the West, running from Latakia in the north to Damascus in the south, and an autonomous Syrian-Kurdish region could be established in the northeast, with the rest of the country being left to the Sunni opposition.
Peace is not yet around the corner, though.
Iran and Saudi Arabia, with their proxies on the ground, remain at loggerheads over how to resolve the conflict; Turkey is engaged in its own war against the Kurds; and the Sunni opposition remains unwilling to compromise.
Should Assad be tempted to recover Aleppo, the Sunni rebels would certainly break the ceasefire and blow up the entire political process.
Even without a political settlement, Putin’s strategic achievements are notable.
Russia’s military operation saved its imperiled ally, Assad, from defeat and secured its airbase in Latakia and its naval presence there and in Tartus. These strongholds will allow him to challenge US and NATO control in the eastern Mediterranean.
The bottom line is that Russia has consolidated its position as a power to be reckoned with in the Middle East.
With the US having largely followed Russia’s lead in the Syrian conflict since the crisis over Assad’s chemical weapons, Middle Eastern leaders now head to Moscow, not Washington, to advance their interests.
King Salman of Saudi Arabia will visit the Kremlin this month to discuss economic cooperation worth billions of dollars.
As for Saudi Arabia’s nemesis Iran, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei’s senior counselor, Ali Akbar Velayati, was in Moscow in February.
Israel, for its part, risked a diplomatic crisis with Australia last month by abruptly canceling an official visit by President Reuven Rivlin, who instead headed to Moscow for an urgent meeting with Putin. (And this occurred just after Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu canceled a planned meeting with Obama in Washington, without even bothering to communicate that officially to the White House.)
For Israel, Russia’s military offensive was a boon, as it will prevent the Iran-Hezbollah-Assad axis from dictating the Syrian conflict’s outcome.
Having coordinated fully with the Russians on the Syrian front, the Israelis now expect Putin to work to keep Iranian forces away from their border on the Golan Heights, and to help bring United Nations observers back to the area.
To be sure, Putin is nowhere near securing a return to the Soviet Union’s imperial days in the Middle East – not least because Russia’s capacity to sustain a military operation beyond its borders remains severely limited.
But his smart use of hard power to achieve specific, achievable objectives in Syria has made Russia a focal point for the major actors in the Middle East – creating a serious geopolitical challenge for the US.
The next American president, it is clear, will have to rethink US regional strategy.
Toward a Rust Belt Powerhouse
LONDON – A few days ago, US President-elect Donald Trump took to Twitter – his medium of choice – to declare that he did not need China’s permission to contact Taiwan, because China didn’t ask for permission to devalue its currency.
At that moment, my hope that the Trump shake-up would be economically beneficial for the United States diminished.
I believe that the developed economies need a jolt to escape their post-2008 malaise and their excessive reliance on easy monetary policy.
Given Trump’s propensity for shaking things up, he seemed a good candidate for the job.
But if the Trump disruption were actually going to help the US, it would need to focus on economic essentials, rather than simplistic – and often false – populist memes.
Judging by his accusations against China, it seems that Trump is simply stirring the pot and riling up his supporters – not advancing any kind of constructive agenda.
After all, any reasonable observer of China – including some of Trump’s own advisers, with whom I have worked in the past – knows that the country has not devalued its currency for some time.
Yes, the Chinese renminbi has declined recently against the dollar, but not as much as the Japanese yen, the euro, or the British pound – and those declines have been driven by relative confidence in the US economy.
In any case, the Chinese have a trade-weighted exchange-rate policy, not one based on keeping the renminbi at some targeted level relative to the dollar.
Instead of accusing China of undermining US companies’ competitiveness, Trump should be focused on a genuine pro-growth strategy.
Such a strategy could follow the British “northern powerhouse” model – which I helped to create as a member of the government – focused on revitalizing the economies of the former heartland of British manufacturing.
London is the only city in the United Kingdom that ranks in the world’s top 50.
That is a big deal in a world where, for the last 20 years, cities have accounted for more than 60% of economic growth, wealth expansion, and gains in living standards.
Individually, the far smaller cities in England’s north cannot really compete with that.
But, by linking together major cities – including Manchester, Sheffield, Leeds, and Liverpool – the north could become far more unified, with seven million people acting as a single regional economy, thereby providing many of the agglomeration benefits of major global cities.
And, indeed, the distances between Manchester, Leeds, Liverpool, and Sheffield are smaller than the distances covered by the Central, District, and Piccadilly lines in the London Underground.
With affordable state-of-the-art transport systems, therefore, it seems clear that these cities could take advantage of urban agglomeration benefits.
Of course, the cities of England’s north are proud of their unique histories and eager to maintain their individual sense of identity.
None of this would be taken away from them.
While it is understandable that some have viewed the northern powerhouse strategy as a platform for emphasizing their own superiority, this is unhelpful, not least because it causes some decision-makers in the central government to doubt the project’s relevance.
Why invest so much in these cities, when so many other areas of the country are also struggling?
The only answer is precisely the opportunity to reap the benefits of integration.
Fortunately, despite some doubts, the UK government has announced efforts to kick-start some of the necessary transport links, with the goal of shortening the Leeds-Manchester train journey to 30 minutes.
But other elements of the northern powerhouse plan are just as important, especially the devolution of significant decision-making powers – and some spending and revenue powers – to the city level, in exchange for electing mayors (something the UK can learn from the US).
After all, England is probably the most politically centralized economy in the OECD – a reality that probably contributes to its deep regional imbalances.
Beyond devolution and transport, England’s north needs to improve dramatically the education and skills of its labor force, in order to attract and retain cutting-edge companies.
Plans to replicate some of the remarkable improvements in London and southeast England’s educational attainment of the last 20 years are ambitious but achievable.
The reality is that, with greater decision-making authority and more linkages and skills, England’s northern cities could become far more dynamic, potentially reversing decades of relative economic decline.
In fact, I would venture to predict that the northern powerhouse project, which has already attracted the attention of local and foreign investors, will be one of the UK’s most important structural economic policies for many years to come.
That is why it is critical that UK leaders continue to advance it.
The northern powerhouse strategy provides valuable lessons for other countries.
Already, China is pursuing a similar regional development strategy, aimed at revitalizing its old northern industrial belt, thereby taking some of the pressure off its ultra-dynamic coastal cities.
The US should follow suit, with a plan to revitalize the so-called Rust Belt that was integral to Trump’s victory.
As an added benefit, such an approach could spur “competitive envy” in other sluggish regions.
That is what has happened in the UK, with progress in England’s north spurring some to argue for, say, a “Midlands engine,” covering the other major urban-based UK area outside of London, with many cities in close proximity to one another.
Of course, the US is much larger than England, and its old industrial cities are much farther apart.
But some of the ideas that have animated the northern powerhouse could enrich Trump’s economic plans considerably.
Given that infrastructure investment is a key element of his agenda, and that devolution of powers to the states is popular among US Republicans, there certainly seems to be space for such an approach.
A Formula for Health Equity
KIGALI – Imagine a country where some 90% of the population is covered by health insurance, more than 90% of those with HIV are on a consistent drug regime, and 93% of children are vaccinated against common communicable diseases including HPV.
Where would you guess this enchanted land of medical equity is?
Scandinavia?
Costa Rica?
Narnia?
Try Africa – Rwanda, to be precise.
In my native country, health care is a right guaranteed for all, not a privilege reserved for the rich and powerful.
Rwanda remains poor, but, over the past 15 years, its health care advances have gained global attention, for good reason.
In 2000, life expectancy at birth was just 48 years; today, it’s 67.
International aid has helped, but our achievements have come primarily from other, non-financial innovations.
For starters, Rwanda has established a collaborative, cluster approach to governance that allows us to achieve more with the same amount of funding.
Moreover, our civil servants embrace problem solving, demonstrating a level of resourcefulness that has produced many localized solutions to human development challenges such as ensuring food security and adequate supplies of clean water and housing.
But perhaps the most important factor behind our dramatic health-care gains has been the national equity agenda, which sets targets for supporting the needy and tracks progress toward meeting them.
Since implementing this approach, Rwanda has managed to decrease the percentage of people living in extreme poverty from 40% of the population in 2000 to 16.3% in 2015
Aside from the obvious benefits, these gains matter because, as UNICEF recently noteda country’s potential return on investment in social services for vulnerable children is two times greater when the benefits reach the most vulnerable.
In other words, Rwanda has achieved so much so fast because we are enjoying higher rates of return by investing in the poorest.
In working toward health equity, Rwanda has made accessibility a top priority.
As of 2016, nine out of ten Rwandans were enrolled in one of the country’s health insurance programs.
The majority of the population is enrolled in the Community-Based Health Insurance (CBHI) scheme, which has increased access to health care for Rwanda’s most vulnerable citizens by waiving fees.
As a result, the reach of health-care coverage in Rwanda is high by global standards – all the more remarkable for a country that suffered the horrors of genocide a generation ago.
Consider the situation in the US: while the rate of uninsured Americans has dropped precipitously under the 2010 Affordable Care Act, the insured face rapid increases in premiums and out-of-pocket expenses.
Perhaps the US should consider adopting a CBHI-type program, to reduce further the number of Americans facing financial barriers to medical care.
Rwanda has crafted health care delivery with access in mind as well, by deploying community health workers (CHWs) to the country’s 15,000 villages.
These local practitioners serve as the gatekeepers to a system that has reduced waiting times and financial burdens by treating patients directly – often at patients’ homes.
The US could also benefit from a CHW program.
The US is brimming with educated young people who, as CHWs, could bridge the gap between medical facilities and patients, thereby improving American social capital and health outcomes.
As Rwanda’s experience has demonstrated, such programs not only broaden access to health care; they also lower overall costs by reducing unnecessary hospitalizations.
Such programs have been shown to be transferable.
Starting in 1997, Brigham and Women’s Hospital supported the HIV+ community of Boston through the Prevention and Access to Care and Treatment (PACT) program.
That initiative was based on the CHW model implemented in rural Haiti by Partners In Health – a non-profit health-care organization that integrates CHWs into primary care and mental health.
As a result of that initiative, the government insurer Medicaid spent less money on hospital stays, and inpatient expenditures fell by 62%.
Other US communities could, and should, incorporate similar models into their treatment programs for chronic conditions.
Innovation is what kick-started Rwanda’s health-care revival, and progressive thinking is what drives it forward today.
For example, health centers established throughout the country provide vaccinations and treat illnesses that village-level CHWs cannot, and have extended obstetrics services to the majority of Rwandan women.
Broadening access further, each district in Rwanda has one hospital, and each region in the country has a referral or teaching hospital with specialists to handle more difficult cases.
While some hospitals still suffer from staff shortages, the government has sought to patch these holes through an initiative that employs faculty from over 20 US institutions to assist in training our clinical specialists.
In just over two decades, thanks to homegrown solutions and international collaboration, Rwanda has dramatically reduced the burden of disease on its people and economy.
As we look forward, our goal is to educate tomorrow’s leaders to build on the equitable health-care system that we have created.
This is the mission of the University of Global Health Equity, a new university based in rural Rwanda that has made fairness, collaboration, and innovation its guiding principles.
As a Rwandan doctor who contributed to building my country’s health-care system from its infancy, I am proud of what we have accomplished in so short a time.
It wasn’t magic; it was a formula.
Through continued global cooperation, other countries, including developed ones, can learn to apply it.
The Heart of Africa’s New Medical School
SAN FRANCISCO – Rwanda has achieved some of the most dramatic gains in health and poverty-reduction in the world.
This small, landlocked African country (the size of Massachusetts, but with twice the population) has developed a primary health-care system with near-universal access to clinical care and insurance.
Rwanda has reduced both economic and health-care inequality, and demonstrates how “health equity” helps to build strong societies.
The secret to Rwanda’s success is that its leaders are building “modern institutions on traditional values.”
They built a system of community justice, called Gacaca, which integrated their need for nationwide reconciliation with an ancient tradition of clemency.
They breathed life back into a civic tradition of Umuganda, where one day a month, citizens, including the president, gather together to weed their fields, clean their streets, and build homes for the poorest among them.
In 2015, the government of Rwanda and the Boston-based Partners In Health (PIH), with the help of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the Cummings Foundation, established the private, not-for-profit University of Global Health Equity (UGHE).
The university is founded on the principle that every member of a community deserves the same care and opportunity, and focuses on the delivery of quality health care to those who need it most.
Agnes Binagwaho, a co-founder of UGHE who is a former minister of health and an adjunct professor at Harvard Medical School, once said to me, “Why would I want to raise my children in a nation where all children don’t get the same medical care as they do?”
Rwanda’s government has already pledged $43 million to UGHE in land and infrastructure support.
Its leaders have launched a two-year, part-time Master of Science in Global Health Delivery to teach how to create national health care in developing countries.
Lecturers from Rwanda’s Ministry of Health, Harvard Medical School, Yale University, and Tufts University taught Rwandan students everything from epidemiology to budget management.
Last summer, UGHE began construction on a 250-acre campus in Butaro.
This year, 250 professionals from as far away as Mexico and Australia will compete for 25 spots on that campus.
Undergraduate and graduate degrees in nursing and oral health, and non-clinical programs in research and health management, are next.
In 2018, UGHE’s campus will also be home to a school of medicine.
It will provide space for generations of health professionals to learn how to heal patients, comprehend the sociology of disease, and build the health systems that make a strong society.
UGHE’s founders believe that, by the time the university celebrates its ten-year anniversary, 480 students will have graduated; another 870 will be earning their degrees; and over 2,500 professionals will have attended executive education courses.
They expect that over 1,000 of the students passing through the UGHE’s doors in that first decade will arrive from the rest of Africa, Asia, Europe, and the Americas.
Rwandans will invite these international students to visit their communities to observe their traditions and learn how to care for their people.
The young men and women will attend Rwandans’ weddings and funerals, learn to prepare and enjoy their foods, and acquire some of their language, the portal through which to view their sturdy values.
Rwandans will teach their international guests that in Africa, family is an all-encompassing concept, and that, in Rwanda, an entire generation treats the next as its own children.
The international network of UGHE alumni, unified by their commitment to realize health equity for their own communities, will become a global force for change.
UGHE will also strengthen Rwandan society.
Though regarded by many as one of the safest and least corrupt societies in the world, Rwanda faces a great shortage of doctors and nurses.
There are 684 physicians in Rwanda, a total that is far below the 1,182 physicians proposed by the Ministry of Health, and only 27% of the World Health Organization’s recommended minimum of 2,576 physicians.
UGHE has already generated jobs, by hiring local laborers, and has increased access to the region, by creating new roads.
It could boost Rwanda’s GDP by 0.5% per year, and every dollar invested in UGHE could generate $2 worth of return in economic development, according to McKinsey & Company.
Some social scientists assert that poverty is not just a matter of poor nutrition, lack of medical care, and inadequate shelter; it also means exclusion from global networks of trade, science and commerce.
This isolation is pernicious, because it destroys people’s hope and aspirations for a better life.
UGHE will be Rwanda’s newest institution, a public-private collaboration based on traditional values: community, trust, hard work, and optimism about the future.
It will integrate each citizen of Rwanda into global networks of learning.
The Rwandans will accomplish this, as they do many things, because they believe that the only investment that can bring infinite returns is in their children, and because graduates of the University of Global Health Equity will be their sons and daughters, too.
The Saudi Prince’s Dangerous War Games
TEL AVIV – A series of stunning political developments, originating in Saudi Arabia, has been roiling an already volatile Middle East.
Is a major new war in the offing?
Saudi Arabia’s ambitious 32-year-old crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman (widely known by his initials, MBS), who is overseeing an historic (and destabilizing) transformation of the Kingdom’s economy, has ordered the arrest of many of the country’s most powerful princes and officials.
The move, framed as an anti-corruption drive, is a brazen bid to consolidate power.
But MBS’s ambitions extend far beyond his country’s borders.
On the same day, Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri announced his resignation in a live television broadcast from Riyadh, accusing Iran of causing “devastation and chaos” through its meddling in other countries.
When, days later, Riyadh was targeted by a long-range missile launched from Yemen by Iran-backed Houthi rebels, the Saudis lost no time in warning Iran of a possible war.
Saudi leaders also denounced Hezbollah – Lebanon’s Iran-backed Shia militia – for aiding the Houthis.
Citing the inclusion of Hezbollah members in Lebanon’s government, Saudi Arabia accused the country of declaring war on the Kingdom, and ordered its citizens to leave the country.
MBS clearly hopes to establish Saudi Arabia as the Persian Gulf’s sole hegemon, and the protector of Sunni Islam throughout the Middle East.
But his efforts increasingly look like the work of an immature gambler.
Saudi Arabia has already suffered from the farcical failure of its blockade on Qatar, not to mention its two disastrous attempts to stem Iranian advances in Syria and Yemen.
Add to that MBS’s ham-fisted political purge, and the escalation in Lebanon may be viewed as a desperate gambit.
Yet provoking Iran is probably not in Saudi Arabia’s best interests.
As MBS knows all too well, the Kingdom cannot match Iran’s military might.
And his likely back-up plan – increasing security cooperation with Israel – might not work as he would like.
True, Israel’s chief of staff, General Gadi Eisenkot, spoke in a rare interview with a Saudi newspaper about the “many shared interests” between the two countries.
Moreover, Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman has warned that Israel would not permit the consolidation of a Shia “axis in Syria.”
And Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu has made it clear that Israel will not allow Iran to gain military ground and naval footholds in Syria.
But it is folly to think that Israel would engage in full-scale war north of its border for Saudi Arabia’s sake.
It would not even be the first time Israel frustrated Saudi Arabia’s expectations of an intervention.
In 2012, Netanyahu did not follow through on threats to attack Iran’s nuclear installations.
More recently, Israel refused to intervene in the Syrian civil war against Bashar al-Assad’s Shia-affiliated Alawite regime.
In fact, Israel has taken great pains to avoid being sucked into that conflict, even as it has scaled up aerial attacks on arms convoys headed for Hezbollah, which has been attempting to open a second front against Israel on the Golan.
Yet it would be irresponsible to dismiss the idea of war altogether.
After all, wars on Israel’s northern front have not always been premeditated.
And an increasingly self-confident Assad no longer seems resigned to Israel’s insistence that its air force should have full freedom of action in Syria and Lebanon: his anti-aircraft batteries have started to respond to Israeli military flights over Syria.
On November 11, Israeli forces shot down a Syrian drone.
Moreover, Israel has established a new red line in Syria: the protection of Syria’s Druze community, with whom Israel’s own highly loyal Druze citizens have strong bonds.
On November 3, after rebel forces killed nine people in a Druze village inside Syria, the Israeli military warned that it would intervene to prevent the occupation of the village.
While Israel is not interested in waging all-out war, it does not see such a scenario as entirely implausible.
In September, it conducted its largest military exercise in two decades, with its air, sea, and large ground forces spending two weeks simulating conflict on both the Syrian and Lebanese fronts.
A massive evacuation of northern Israel’s civilian population was also simulated.
After two wars with Hezbollah that ended in a sort of tie, Israel has made it clear that, in any new conflict, the goal would be unequivocal victory.
Hezbollah, drained by its costly effort to support Assad in Syria’s civil war, is not particularly eager to engage in a showdown with Israel now.
Iran, for its part, has avoided disrupting Lebanon’s stability and always-precarious truce with Israel, in order to enable Hezbollah to focus on Syria.
But Saudi Arabia would welcome a clash between Israel and Hezbollah, believing that it would inevitably lead to a confrontation between Israel and Iran.
This is particularly true now: as the fighting in Syria subsides, the Saudi-led Sunni axis is eager to compensate for its losses there, and thus is pushing Lebanon as the next battlefield.
As it stands, Lebanon remains split between Hezbollah’s pro-Syria and Iran camp – which includes President Michel Aoun – and Hariri’s “March 14 Alliance” of Sunni, anti-Syrian groups, which Saudi Arabia hopes to push into the conflict it so desires.
Of course, engaging in a war led by powers that view Lebanon merely as a piece of a broader strategic puzzle is not in the country’s best interests.
It is not in Hariri’s best interests, either; after all, such a conflict would deny his family’s construction companies the opportunity to win lavish contracts for rebuilding Syria.
Indeed, it seems highly likely that Hariri is in Riyadh against his will.
As MBS plays with fire, US President Donald Trump has offered him broad support, owing to his own animosity toward Iran and, perhaps, the hope that Saudi Arabia will support a US-led peace plan on Palestine.
But a more benign enticement must urgently be found.
After all, as the Syrian conflict has starkly demonstrated, wars usually defeat their own purposes.
Saving America from Trump’s Tax Reform
BERKELEY – US President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans had an opportunity – and a responsibility – to reform the US tax code to address three major economic challenges: slowing growth, rising inequality, and a looming fiscal crisis.
Sadly, they shirked their responsibility by passing a bill that squandered this opportunity.
At a time when US public debt as a share of GDP is already at a post-war high, the legislation will add another $1.5-2.2 trillion to the deficit over the next decade.
At a time when income and wealth inequality is soaring, an estimated 80% of the tax cuts will go to the top 1% by 2027.
And at a time when the economy has been growing steadily for 33 quarters and is approaching full employment, the legislation will have only a modest effect on growth.
To be sure, a significant cut in the corporate tax rate was long overdue.
The legislation will likely stimulate investment and encourage domestic and foreign companies to do business in the United States.
But, by an overwhelming majority, economists predict that the increase in the growth rate will fall far short of the annual gain of one percentage point (or more) hyped by Trump and his economic advisers.
Moreover, there is no credible evidence to support the Trump administration’s declaration that the trickle-down benefits of faster growth will “increase average household income in the United States by, very conservatively, $4,000 annually.”
A large body of economic research shows that, at most, 20-25% of the benefits of corporate tax cuts will accrue to labor; the rest will go to shareholders, about one-third of whom are foreign.
The biggest beneficiaries will be the top 1% of domestic households which own about half of outstanding shares.
Nor is there evidence to support the administration’s claim that the legislation will pay for itself.
As many of those who voted for it well know, the expected gains in growth will yield at most about one-third of lost revenues.
But they are playing a cynical game.
By reducing revenues now, they will be in a position to justify cuts to services benefiting lower- and middle-class Americans down the road – all in the name of “fiscal responsibility” and “entitlement reform.”
Worse yet, the tax legislation is riddled with provisions that will dramatically increase inequality and limit economic and social mobility.
By cutting the top income-tax rate, doubling the threshold at which inheritances are taxed, and lowering taxes on pass-through businesses, the legislation amounts to a handout for the wealthy, paid for by the middle class and future generations.
The legislation also prioritizes investment in physical and financial capital over what the US really needs: more investment in human capital and lifelong learning to help workers and communities cope with the disruptive effects of automation and artificial intelligence.
Instead of expanding the earned income tax credit to encourage work, the legislation will, for the first time in American history, impose a higher tax rate on employment income than on income earned by proprietors and partnerships.
In addition, the legislation is an unabashedly partisan attack on Democratic-leaning states and cities.
For example, the bill imposes an across-the-board limit on mortgage deductions, which will have a disproportionately adverse effect on people living in high-cost Democratic strongholds such as New York and California.
Currently, the median price for a home in San Francisco is $1.5 million; in Kansas, a reliably Republican state, it is $187,000.
And if that weren’t bad enough, the bill intentionally penalizes higher-tax states like California and New York, by capping the federal deduction for state and local income and property taxes.
Ironically, this provision will hurt growth, by raising the marginal tax rate on millions of workers in the country’s most productive locales and industries.
And it will make it harder for state and local governments to finance necessary investments in innovation, infrastructure, and higher education – investments that are largely the states’ responsibility but are pillars of overall US competitiveness.
A majority of Americans already recognize that the tax law is deeply flawed and full of false promises.
After failing to repeal the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), congressional Republicans rammed through a complicated tax package that will please their wealthy donors, but disappoint many of their voters.
Given the tax law’s unpopularity, it will be interesting to see what happens in the midterm congressional elections this November.
In the meantime, progressive federalists in forward-looking states and cities must get to work picking up the pieces of the wreckage the federal government is leaving in its wake.
Keep an eye out for the many ways states will re-orient their tax regimes away from income taxes, and toward property and sales taxes, including on services, which account for more than 70% of economic activity but have traditionally been taxed lightly at the state and local level.
In some states, there is even talk of reclassifying state taxes so that they qualify as tax-deductible charitable contributions.
Similarly, some have proposed replacing state income taxes with payroll taxes that employers can deduct at the federal level.
Keep an eye out as well for a sizeable increase in outcome-oriented state and local funding for efforts to reduce homelessness and reform the criminal-justice system.
Owing to its high marginal income tax rates and constraints on residential property taxes, California will likely be at the forefront of fiscal innovation.
Already, multiple reform proposals are circulating, including a ballot initiative to amend Proposition 13 that would dramatically ease existing restrictions on commercial-property taxes.
And with the Democrats in full control of the state’s government, measures to counteract the federal law are almost certain to be adopted.
California Governor Jerry Brown, for his part, has called the Republicans’ legislation a “tax monstrosity.”
He’s right: it’s dreadful policy.
Other countries that have reduced taxes on mobile corporate capital have paid for the cuts by increasing value-added taxes and taxes on carbon, dividends, capital gains, and inheritances.
Trump and the Republicans, by contrast, chose to cut taxes on both businesses and their owners, while blowing an unsustainable hole in the federal budget, exacerbating inequality, and imposing new burdens on the most productive parts of the country.
Still, necessity is the mother of invention.
For progressive federalists in US cities and states – the laboratories of democracy – it is now more necessary than ever to step up and start innovating.
Resurrecting Creditor Adjustment
LONDON – With all the protectionist talk coming from US President Donald Trump’s administration, it is surprising that no one has mentioned, much less sought to invoke, an obvious tool for addressing persistent external imbalances: the 1944 Bretton Woods Agreement’s “scarce-currency clause.”
That clause, contained in Article 7 of the agreement, authorizes countries, “after consultation with the [International Monetary] Fund, temporarily to impose limitations on freedom of exchange operations in the scarce currency”; and it grants those countries “complete jurisdiction in determining the nature of such limitations.”
A country’s currency is considered scarce in the foreign-exchange market if it imports more than it exports – which is to say, if it runs a current-account deficit.
The scarce-currency clause has an interesting history.
In his original plan for an International Clearing Bank, the British economist John Maynard Keynes proposed an escalating range of sanctions against member states that maintained continuous credit balances (and less onerous sanctions on countries with persistent debt balances).
The idea was to pressure countries to reduce their current-account surpluses.
Surplus countries would not be prevented from spending their money freely, but they would not be permitted to hoard it.
The United States, which was by far the world’s largest creditor, understandably refused to go along with Keynes’s proposal.
As a result, the IMF was left to provide short-term financial help for deficit countries, and otherwise to uphold the orthodox doctrine of debtor adjustment.
But, to placate the British, Harry Dexter White, the US Treasury official now remembered as the architect of the Bretton Woods Agreement, inserted Article 7 to allow dollar-deprived member states to restrict their purchases of US goods.
The scarce-currency clause has remained a dead letter ever since.
In the early postwar years, the US plugged up European countries’ current-account gaps with Marshall Plan funds.
By the early 1970s, the US itself was running trade deficits, and the dollar was in oversupply.
The US Congress urged the IMF to invoke the scarce-currency clause against “recalcitrant” surplus countries, but its efforts were in vain.
As the Princeton University historian Harold James has pointed out, the tables had turned: the US had taken up Keynes’s arguments, but creditor European countries, along with Japan, successfully resisted them.
Fast-forward to today.
Of the world’s four largest economies, only the US suffers persistently weak competitiveness.
China, Japan, and Germany, by contrast, are super-competitive.
And because China has been willing, for its own reasons, to finance the US deficit, the dollar and the renminbi now seem to be locked into misaligned positions.
To redress this state of affairs, the economist Vladimir Masch suggests that the US should pursue a plan of “compensated free trade” (CFT), which essentially amounts to a unilateral activation of the scarce-currency clause.
The Trump administration would set a ceiling on the US trade deficit each year, and then impose limits on major US trading partners’ surpluses.
This would largely affect China, Japan, Germany, and Mexico, which contributed $347 billion, $69 billion, $65 billion, and $64 billion, respectively, to the US’s $737 billion trade deficit in 2016.
Under Masch’s CFT arrangement, it would be up to each surplus country to limit its exports to the US.
Countries could exceed their export quotas only if they paid a fine equal to the difference between the value of their actual and allowed exports.
And if they tried to export more than allowed without paying the fine, their surplus exports would be blocked.
The problem with this plan is that it puts no pressure on Germany to reduce its surpluses with other eurozone countries.
To be sure, after the 2008 global financial crisis, the European Union did establish a Macroeconomic Imbalance Procedure to fine eurozone countries with surpluses exceeding 6% of GDP or deficits exceeding 4% of GDP.
But the MIP, even if it is in the spirit of Keynes’s proposal for an International Clearing Union, lacks two essential mechanisms.
First, Keynes’s plan would have automatically levied sanctions against persistent creditors, whereas the EU’s framework has proved incapable of doing so.
Germany has run a surplus exceeding 6% of GDP for over a decade with impunity.
Although its surplus vis-à-vis the eurozone recently shrank to under 3% of GDP, that is largely a reflection of impoverished Mediterranean countries importing fewer German goods.
If those countries’ economies recover and return to anything near full employment, the German surplus will likely rebound.
The MIP’s second flaw is that it lacks the omit protections for debtors that are afforded by the scarce-currency clause.
Without the ability to devalue their currencies, the only recourse the eurozone’s persistent debtors have is to threaten to leave the single currency.
But, as the Greek crisis demonstrated, this is not a credible threat.
The result is that imbalances between creditors and debtors have been locked into place.
One way to unlock current imbalances would be to adapt the Bretton Woods mechanism.
Each eurozone member state would pay into a European Monetary Fund in proportion to its national income and level of trade.
And the Fund would have its own scarce-currency clause, allowing for member states to discriminate against imports from creditor countries.
In his wide-ranging speech at the Sorbonne last month, French President Emmanuel Macron called for the creation of a European Monetary Fund, though he did not spell out the details of what he envisions.
A mechanism that provides for trade discrimination could potentially violate the EU’s free-trade principles.
And yet economic integration has always depended on some degree of creditor adjustment.
Without it, a free-trade system will eventually break down.
Advocates of open borders can pay now, or they will certainly pay later.
Schrödinger’s Immigrant
PRAGUE – When Central and Eastern European leaders try to explain why they do not want to accept refugees, they tend to contradict one another.
Some insist that refugees take jobs from natives, which implies that refugees are hard workers; others complain that refugees rely on welfare benefits, which suggests that they work too little.
Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, for example, argues for the former.
Between 2015 and 2016, his government spent more than €50 million ($59 million) on anti-immigrant advertisements, including billboards warning immigrants not to take natives’ jobs.
By contrast, Czech politicians such as former Deputy Prime Minister Andrej Babiš, Minister of the Interior Milan Chovanec, and former President Václav Klaus all portray refugees and migrants as freeloaders who have their sights set on generous welfare benefits.
And according to the current Czech president, Miloš Zeman, these welfare-seekers can all be lumped into a single category: “Muslims.”
In light of these contrasting portrayals of refugees, a popular meme has taken off in Central and Eastern Europe: “Schrödinger’s immigrant.”
It is a play on Schrödinger’s cat, which describes a paradox in quantum physics in which a particle can exist in two opposite states simultaneously – like a cat that, having been sealed in a box, is both dead and alive until it is observed.
[Chart]
According to the European Social Survey, there is little agreement in Europe about whether refugees and migrants take existing jobs, or actually create new ones (see chart above).
At Odlišnost (Distinction), a collective of academics and journalists, we have reviewed 20 empirical studies to determine the effect that immigrants had on native workers in Europe and the Middle East between 1990 and 2015.
All told, we found little evidence to support the claim that accepting a reasonable number of refugees and migrants from developing countries deprives native-born workers of employment.
Of course, many of those who don’t believe that immigrants take natives’ jobs still worry that newcomers do not contribute enough in taxes.
There is some truth to this.
The growing share of immigrants arriving from developing countries includes many less-educated workers, particularly among women, and that can reduce incomes and the overall employment rate for immigrants.
But high- and low-skill migrants alike contribute to the efficient division of labor in their host countries, because cultural differences make it harder for them to compete with locals.
The studies we examined show that, in terms of wages, immigrants from close neighboring countries put a small amount of downward pressure on the wages of low-skill natives.
With immigrants from afar, however, this negative effect disappears.
More generally, people from different cultures bring different skills and fresh ideas to the host economy.
There is substantial evidence to suggest that birthplace diversity within a country’s college-educated workforce is positively associated with productivity and economic growth.
In the United States, first- or second-generation immigrants founded more than 40% of Fortune 500 companies, including Google, Apple, and Amazon.
This is not surprising.
After all, migrants tend to be more educated than their compatriots back home.
In Austria in 2015, the ratio of Syrian and Iraqi asylum applicants with a college education was the same as that among natives.
Given this, immigrants from afar may actually contribute even more economically than those from neighboring countries.
The University of Louvain economist Frédéric Docquier and his colleagues have been researching the economic impact that immigrants from developing countries have on host-country budgets, wages, and consumer markets.
In a forthcoming study on immigrants who arrived in 20 OECD countries between 1991 and 2015, they find that natives seem to have benefited significantly from immigrants’ contributions.
Even at first sight, the argument, often made by anti-immigrant politicians, that refugees and migrants are coming to European countries to exploit their social-welfare programs, seems odd.
Germany and Sweden are generally seen as having the most generous migrant benefits, yet there is no uniform flow of people toward those two countries.
In 2016, Syrians did flee to Germany and Scandinavia (see graph below).
But Eritreans often headed for Switzerland, and many Afghanis applied for asylum in Hungary.
[Graph]
Economists weighing this issue through the lens of “revealed preference theory” would argue that asylum-seekers are analytical decision-makers who seek out countries such as Germany for its low unemployment rate.
But researchers who have examined non-economic data, not least migrants’ responses to surveys, have good reason to cast doubt on this assumption.
It turns out that asylum applicants typically have little to no knowledge of a country’s labor-market conditions or welfare benefits before they arrive.
Rather, they are usually guided by the circumstances of their journey.
And when they do consciously choose a country, they tend to look for places where their compatriots or relatives already live, or where they already know the language, owing to past colonial ties.
It is intuitively plausible that refugees could be drawn to countries with faster, more generous asylum procedures.
But studies have repeatedly failed to establish any meaningful correlation between welfare provision and refugees’ choice of destination.
What little knowledge of different countries’ asylum policies refugees do have often is based on rumors, usually heard from smugglers who have little concern for their interests.
Nativist politicians will undoubtedly dismiss “Schrödinger’s immigrant” as a liberal factotum.
But the meme will remain popular for as long as nativists hide behind the language of popular economics.
The immigration debate should be decided on its merits, not through the politics of fear.
Are the Sustainable Development Goals Achievable?
HONG KONG – US President Donald Trump’s recent speech at the United Nations has gotten a lot of attention for its bizarre and bellicose rhetoric, including threats to dismantle the Iran nuclear deal and “totally destroy” North Korea.
Underlying his declarations was a clear message: the sovereign state still reigns supreme, with national interests overshadowing shared objectives.
This does not bode well for the Sustainable Development Goals.
Adopted by the UN just a year before Trump’s election, the SDGs will require that countries cooperate on crucial global targets related to climate change, poverty, public health, and much else.
In an age of contempt for international cooperation, not to mention entrenched climate-change denial in the Trump administration, is achieving the SDGs wishful thinking?
The SDGs were always bound to meet strong headwinds, owing to technological disruption, geopolitical rivalry, and widening social inequality.
But populist calls for nationalist policies, including trade protectionism, have intensified those headwinds considerably.
Simply put, populations are losing faith that the global development orthodoxy of good governance (including monetary and fiscal discipline) and free markets can benefit them.
With all of the advanced countries confronting serious fiscal constraints, and emerging markets weakened by lower commodity prices, paying for global public goods has become all the more unappealing.
Budget cuts – together with accountability issues and new technological challenges – are also hurting those tasked with delivering good governance.
And markets increasingly seem to be captured by vested interests.
Economic outcomes often have their origins in politics.
Harvard Law School’s Roberto Unger has argued that overcoming the challenges of knowledge-based development will demand “inclusive vanguardism.”
The democratization of the market economy, he says, is possible only with “a corresponding deepening of democratic politics,” which implies “the institutional reconstruction of the market itself.”
Yet, in the US, the political system seems unlikely to produce such a reconstruction.
Harvard Business School Professors Katherine Gehl and Michael Porter argue that America’s two-party system “has become the major barrier to solving nearly every important challenge” facing the country.
Political leaders, Gehl and Porter continue, “compete on ideology and unrealistic promises, not on action and results,” and “divide voters and serve special interests” – all while facing little accountability.
A forthcoming book by University of San Francisco Professor Shalendra Sharma corroborates this view.
Comparing economic inequality in China, India, and the US, Sharma argues that both democratic and authoritarian governance have failed to promote equitable development.
There are four potential combinations of outcomes for countries: (1) good governance and good economic policies; (2) good politics and bad economics; (3) bad politics and good economics; and (4) bad politics and bad economics.
Other things being equal, there is only a one-in-four chance of arriving at a win-win situation of good governance and strong economic performance.
That chance is diminished further by other disruptions, from natural disasters to external interference.
There are those who believe that technology will help to overcome such disruptions, by spurring enough growth to generate the resources needed to mitigate their impact.
But while technology is consumer-friendly, it produces its own considerable costs.
Technology kills jobs in the short term and demands re-skilling of the labor force.
Moreover, knowledge-intensive technology has a winner-take-all network effect, whereby hubs seize access to knowledge and power, leaving less-privileged groups, classes, sectors, and regions struggling to compete.
Thanks to social media, the resulting discontent now spreads faster than ever, leading to destructive politics.
This can invite geopolitical interference, which quickly deteriorates into a lose-lose scenario, like that already apparent in water-stressed and conflict-affected countries, where governments are fragile or failing.
The combination of bad politics and economics in one country can easily produce contagion, as rising migration spreads political stress and instability to other countries.
According to the UN High Commission for Refugees, there were 65 million refugees last year, compared to just 1.6 million in 1960.
Given the endurance of geopolitical conflict, not to mention the rapidly growing impact of climate change, migration levels are not expected to decline anytime soon.
The SDGs aim to relieve these pressures, by protecting the environment and improving the lives of people within their home countries.
But achieving them will require far more responsible politics and a much stronger social consensus.
And that will require a fundamental shift in mindset, from one of competition to one that emphasizes cooperation.
Just as we have no global tax mechanism to ensure the provision of global public goods, we have no global monetary or welfare policies to maintain price stability and social peace.
That is why multilateral institutions need to be upgraded and restructured, with effective decision-making and implementation mechanisms for managing global development challenges such as infrastructure gaps, migration, climate change, and financial instability.
Such a system would go a long way toward supporting progress toward the SDGs.
Unger argues that all of today’s democracies “are flawed, low-energy democracies,” in which “no trauma” – in the form of economic ruin or military conflict – means “no transformation.” He is right.
In this environment, reflected in Trump’s embrace of the antiquated Westphalian model of nation-states, achieving the SDGs will probably be impossible.
The Who, Where, and When of Secession
CAMBRIDGE – This week, Kurds in northern Iraq voted overwhelmingly in favor of independence for the country’s Kurdistan Region.
With some 30 million Kurds divided among four states (Iraq, Turkey, Syria, Iran), nationalists argue that they deserve the world’s recognition.
In Spain, some 7.5 million Catalans have raised the same question.
Does it matter that polls show Catalans, unlike Kurds, to be closely divided on the issue?
Does it matter that the states bordering Iraqi Kurdistan might use force to resist secession?
National self-determination, the principle that US President Woodrow Wilson put on the international agenda in 1918, is generally defined as the right of a people to form its own state.
But who is the “self” that makes this determination?
Consider Somalia, whose people, unlike those of most other newly independent African states, had roughly the same linguistic and ethnic background.
Neighboring Kenya was formed by colonial rule from dozens of peoples or tribes.
Somalia claimed that the self-determination principle should allow Somalis in northeastern Kenya and southern Ethiopia to secede.
Kenya and Ethiopia refused, resulting in a number of regional wars over the Somali national question.
The ironic sequel was that Somalia itself later fragmented in a civil war among its clans and warlord leaders.
Today, its northern region, Somaliland, exists as a de facto independent state, though it lacks international recognition or United Nations membership.
Voting does not always solve problems of self-determination.
First, there is the question of where one votes.
In Ireland, for example, Catholics objected for many years that if a vote were held within the political area of Northern Ireland, the two-thirds Protestant majority would rule.
Protestants replied that if a vote were held within the geographical area of the entire island, the Catholic majority would rule.
Eventually, after decades of strife, outside mediation helped bring peace to Northern Ireland.
There is also the question of when one votes?
In the 1960s, the Somalis wanted to vote immediately; Kenya wanted to wait 40 or 50 years while it reshaped tribal allegiances and forged a Kenyan identity.
Another problem is how one weighs the interests of those left behind.
Does secession harm them, by taking resources away or causing other disruption?
Iraqi Kurdistan holds significant oil reserves, and Catalonia is estimated to account for a fifth of Spain’s GDP.
Spain’s government argues that the upcoming independence vote in Catalonia is illegal under the Spanish constitution.
History is not encouraging.
After the Habsburg Empire was dismantled in 1918, the Sudetenland was incorporated into Czechoslovakia, even though most people there spoke German.
After the agreement reached in Munich with Adolf Hitler in 1938, the Sudeten Germans seceded from Czechoslovakia and joined Germany.
But the loss of the mountainous frontier where they lived was a terrible setback for Czech defenses.
Was it right to allow self-determination for the Sudeten Germans, even if it meant stripping Czechoslovakia (which Germany dismembered six months later) of its military defenses?
To take another African example, when the people of eastern Nigeria decided to secede and form the state of Biafra in the 1960s, other Nigerians resisted, in part because Biafra included most of Nigeria’s oil.
They argued that the oil belonged to all the people of Nigeria, not just the eastern area.
After the Cold War ended, self-determination became an acute issue in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union.
In the Caucasus, Azeris, Armenians, Georgians, Abkhazians, and Chechens all demanded states of their own.
In Yugoslavia, Slovenes, Serbs, and Croats managed to carve out independent republics, but the Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina were less successful, and were subjected to a campaign of “ethnic cleansing” by both Croatian and Serb forces.
In 1995, a NATO peacekeeping force was sent to the troubled area, but when NATO intervened militarily in Kosovo in 1999, Russia backed Serbia’s objections to secession, and Kosovo has still not been admitted to the UN.
In turn, Russia invoked self-determination to support Abkhazia’s secession from Georgia in 2008, and its invasion and annexation of Crimea in 2014.
Self-determination turns out to be an ambiguous moral principle.
Wilson thought it would bring stability to Central Europe; instead, Hitler used the principle to undermine the region’s fragile new states in the 1930s.
The lesson remains valid today.
Given that less than 10% of the world’s states are homogeneous, treating self-determination as a primary rather than secondary moral principle could have disastrous consequences in many parts of the world.
Indeed, hostile ethnic groups are often mixed like a marble cake, rather than neatly separable like a layer cake.
That makes partition difficult, as India discovered in 1947.
Perhaps that is why only a few new states have been admitted to the UN in this century.
After it seceded from Sudan, ethnic turmoil inside South Sudan continued, practically unabated.
The best hope for the future is to ask what is being determined as well as who determines it.
In cases where groups cohabit a state uneasily, it may be possible to allow a degree of autonomy in the determination of internal affairs.
Countries like Switzerland or Belgium provide considerable cultural, economic, and political autonomy to their constitutive groups.
Where autonomy is not enough, it may be possible to arrange an amicable divorce, as when Czechoslovakia peacefully divided into two sovereign countries.
But absolute demands for self-determination are more likely to become a source of violence, which is why they must be handled extremely carefully.
Before invoking self-determination as a moral principle, one must heed the diplomatic version of the Hippocratic Oath: Primum non nocere (first, do no harm).
Does Europe Really Need Fiscal and Political Union?
CAMBRIDGE – Greece’s combative former finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, and his nemesis, former German finance minister Wolfgang Schäuble, were at loggerheads on Greek debt throughout Varoufakis’s term in office.
But they were in full agreement when it came to the central question of the eurozone’s future.
Monetary union required political union.
No middle way was possible.
This is one of the interesting revelations in Varoufakis’s fascinating account of his tenure as finance minister.
“You are probably the one [in the Eurogroup] who understands that the eurozone is unsustainable,” Varoufakis quotes Schäuble as telling him. “The eurozone is constructed wrongly.
We should have a political union, there is no doubt about it.”
Of course, Schäuble and Varoufakis had different ideas regarding the ends that political union would serve.
Schäuble saw political union as a means to impose strong fiscal discipline on member states from the center, tying their hands and preventing “irresponsible” economic policies.
Varoufakis thought political union would relax creditors’ stranglehold on his economy and create room for progressive politics across Europe.
Nevertheless, it is remarkable that these two officials from opposite ends of the political spectrum arrived at an identical diagnosis about the euro.
The convergence is indicative of the growing sense of the need for fiscal and eventual political union if the euro is to be maintained without damage to economic performance or democratic values. French President Emmanuel Macron has advanced similar ideas.
And the leader of Germany’s Social Democrats, Martin Schulz, has also thrown his weight behind a “United States of Europe” in recent days.
But there is also an alternative, much less ambitious view, according to which neither fiscal nor political union is needed.
What needs to be done instead is to de-link private finance from public finance, insulating each from the malfeasance of the other.
With this separation, private finance can be fully integrated at the European level, while public finance is left to individual member states.
This way, countries can reap the full benefit of financial integration while national political authorities are left free to manage their own economies.
Brussels would no longer be the bogeyman, insisting on fiscal austerity and drawing the ire of countries with high unemployment and low growth.
Martin Sandbu of the Financial Times has been a strong proponent of the view that a workable monetary and financial union does not require fiscal integration.
He believes the critical reform is to prevent bank bailouts by public authorities.
The price of bank failures should be paid by the banks’ owners and creditors; we should have bail-ins rather than bailouts.
Sandbu argues that this would not only insulate public finance from the follies of banks; it would also lead to an equilibrium that mimics fiscal risk-sharing between countries that are net borrowers and countries that are net lenders.
When banks in the former fail, it is creditors in the latter that would bear the cost.
“With banking union, there is no need for fiscal union,” he argues.
In a forthcoming book, the University of California, Berkeley, economist Barry Eichengreen also makes the case for re-nationalizing fiscal policy, which he views as essential to stemming the tide of European populism.
Eichengreen thinks returning fiscal policy to national authorities would require preventing banks from holding too much government debt, in order to minimize the risk that national fiscal mismanagement topples the banking system.
Governments that go bust would have to restructure their debts rather than get bailouts from other EU states.
Advocates of cutting the Gordian knot between private and public finance recognize that governments’ approach to banks must change radically if this separation is to work.
But it is not clear that their proposed remedies would work.
As long as economic policy remains the province of national governments, sovereign risk will likely continue to distort the operation of cross-border finance.
Sovereign states can always change the rules ex post, which means full financial integration is impossible.
And the costs of local financial shocks cannot be diversified away as easily.
Consider what happens when a large bank goes bankrupt in the US – an economic union where the Sandbu and Eichengreen rules already apply.
The regional economic spillovers are limited by the fact that other borrowers can continue to function normally: creditworthiness is determined by a borrower’s fundamentals and not its state of residence.
No one expects a state government to interfere in inter-state payments, rewrite bankruptcy rules, or issue its own currency in case of extreme distress.
State governments in the US exercise little sovereignty in large part because they have less need of it: their residents receive transfers from the center and send their representatives to Washington, DC, to help make federal policy.
But EU member states are in a very different position vis-à-vis the EU institutions in Brussels.
Because they retain sovereignty, they cannot make similarly credible commitments not to interfere with financial markets.
So the risk remains that a severe enough financial shock in the EU will affect all other borrowers in the same country in a self-fulfilling manner.
Pretending that we can separate private from public finance may exacerbate, rather than moderate, financial boom-and-bust cycles.
In contemporary societies, finance must serve a public purpose beyond the logic of financial market profitability.
So it is irrevocably politicized – for good as well as bad reasons.
It appears that conservative and progressive policymakers alike are resigning themselves to this reality.
This Year’s Cruelest Month?
TARN, FRANCE – To the great poet T.S. Eliot, “April is the cruellest month.”
But in 2017, the world’s politicians could be forgiven for thinking that September is more deserving of the title.
Consider French President Emmanuel Macron, a relative unknown who was elected in May with the support of many who were voting against his second-round opponent, Marine Le Pen of the far-right National Front.
Now, Macron is facing strong opposition from both the far left and the far right over his plan to rejuvenate the French economy.
In addition to budget cuts and a public-sector pay freeze – neither of which would be popular under any circumstances – Macron is trying to reform France’s labor code.
This was sure to kick up a political storm, and French trade unions have already responded by threatening a general strike for the second week in September.
Moreover, Macron has hardly helped himself with some of his decisions since taking office.
For example, one can only wonder why he chose to invite US President Donald Trump to attend France’s Bastille Day celebrations in July.
Such a monarchical display from “le président soleil” was surely a mistake.
Nonetheless, Macron has shown himself to be brave, articulate, and determined to do the right thing.
It remains incumbent upon all liberal, pro-European centrists to wish him well.
In the United Kingdom, September could be the month when Prime Minister Theresa May’s Brexit-bound government and the British public are mugged by reality.
Michael Gove, May’s Secretary of State for Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs, used to argue that the UK would be in the driver’s seat once its exit negotiations with the European Union began.
But that is hardly where one wants to be if one’s vehicle is headed off a cliff.
As we have seen time and again, Britain’s approach to the Brexit negotiations seems to be nothing more than a mix of wishful thinking, back-peddling, and plaintive requests that the EU bend over backward to help British leaders get out of the mess they have made.
While this spectacle has been playing out, UK living standards have been falling.
Many Britons recently returned from vacationing in the European sun to discover that their pound buys them much less than it used to: the euro in their pocket is now worth £0.92 ($1.19), up from £0.70 before the Brexit vote.
And, according to some traders, the pound will continue its decline this fall, and could reach parity with the euro before long.
Worst of all, even as Britain incurs the costs of leaving its largest market, the political gains for doing so remain as illusory as ever.
In the United States, Trump, too, is unlikely to have a good month.
His relations with fellow Republicans in Congress are in free fall, as are his chances of passing any serious legislation.
The failure to repeal or reform the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) has made passing tax cuts only harder; and if lawmakers and the Trump administration do not agree on a spending deal next month, the US federal government will shut down.
Complicating matters further, Trump has continued to direct abusive early morning tweets at members of Congress, the media, and others, while losing or firing top advisers.
If his administration has any organizing principle, it seems to be that of the revolving door: in one moment, out the next.
Trump’s new chief of staff, retired General John Kelly, could still impose discipline within the White House; but it is all but impossible that he will be able to rein in the president himself.
Moreover, just as Trump will continue to issue extremist and ignorant public statements, the investigation into his campaign’s alleged ties to Russia will not end anytime soon.
With each passing week, former FBI Director Robert Mueller and his team of career prosecutors are presumably getting ever closer to unearthing the truth, whatever it may be.
September could also be the month when we witness an explosive showdown between the Trump administration and China.
Trump’s protectionist instincts and hostility to globalization do not bode well for the world as a whole.
But his argument that China plays by different economic rules than everyone else is not far from the truth.
During his country’s accession negotiations with the World Trade Organization in December 2001, a former Chinese commerce minister (who is now in prison for corruption) used to tell me and other negotiators that, “If you respect us by an inch, we’ll respect you by a mile.”
But judging by reports from the US and European business leaders, the opposite seems to be true: we have given China a mile, and gotten an inch in return.
China, simply put, does not play by the rules to which it agreed.
For starters, it protects its own markets from competition, which is abundantly clear in the case of its Internet companies.
And when it does grant foreign companies access to its domestic market, it often requires them to enter into partnerships with Chinese companies, or to hand over intellectual property.
If this continues, China’s partners will eventually lose patience.
While Trump’s disavowal of international trade rules and norms has received ample attention, China’s own abuse of those norms has gone unnoticed.
If China does not improve its behavior, all of us – including the Chinese – will suffer.
China’s economic success need not threaten the rest of the world; but it needs to be achieved on a fair basis.
Chinese President Xi Jinping and his politburo should signal that they are committed to this goal before they gather for the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party this fall.
If they do, September will be slightly less cruel than it otherwise is shaping up to be.
The Changing Geopolitics of Energy
TOKYO – In 2008, when the United States’ National Intelligence Council (NIC) published its volume Global Trends 2025, a key prediction was tighter energy competition.
Chinese demand was growing, and non-OPEC sources like the North Sea were being depleted.
After two decades of low and relatively stable prices, oil prices had soared to more than $100 per barrel in 2006.
Many experts spoke of “peak oil” – the idea that reserves had “topped off” – and anticipated that production would become concentrated in the low-cost but unstable Middle East, where even Saudi Arabia was thought to be fully explored, with no more giant fields likely to be found.
The US was regarded as increasingly dependent on energy imports, and this, together with rising prices, was seen as a major limit on American geopolitical influence.
Power had shifted to the producers.
The NIC analysts did not neglect the possibility of a technological surprise, but they focused on the wrong technology.
Emphasizing the potential of renewables such as solar, wind, and hydro, they missed the main act.
The real technological breakthrough was the shale-energy revolution.
While horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing are not new, their pioneering application to shale rock was.
By 2015, more than half of all the natural gas produced in the US came from shale.
The shale boom has propelled the US from being an energy importer to an energy exporter.
The US Energy Department estimates that the country has 25 trillion cubic meters of technically recoverable shale gas, which, when combined with other oil and gas resources, could last for two centuries.
The International Energy Agency now expects North America to be self-sufficient in energy in the 2020s.
Facilities built to receive liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports have been converted to process exports.
World markets have also been transformed.
Previously, gas markets were geographically restricted by dependence on pipelines.
That gave market power to Russia, which used it to exercise political and economic leverage over its European neighbors.
LNG has now added a degree of flexibility to gas markets and reduced Russian leverage.
In 2005, only 15 countries imported LNG; today, that number has tripled.
Moreover, the smaller scale of shale wells makes them much more responsive to fluctuations in market prices.
It is difficult to turn on and off the billion-dollar multiyear investments in traditional oil and gas fields; but shale wells are smaller, cheaper, and easier to start and stop as prices change.
This means that the US has become the so-called swing producer capable of balancing supply and demand in global hydrocarbon markets.
As Harvard’s Meghan O’Sullivan points out in her smart new book Windfall, the shale revolution has a number of implications for US foreign policy.
She argues that the new energy abundance increases US power.
Shale-energy production boosts the economy and creates more jobs.
Reducing imports helps the balance of payments.
New tax revenues ease government budgets.
Cheaper power strengthens international competitiveness, particularly for energy-intensive industries like petrochemicals, aluminum, steel, and others.
There are also domestic political effects.
One is psychological.
For some time, many people in the US and abroad have bought into the myth of American decline. Increasing dependence on energy imports was often cited as evidence.
The shale revolution has changed that, demonstrating the combination of entrepreneurship, property rights, and capital markets that constitute the country’s underlying strength.
In that sense, the shale revolution has also enhanced American soft power.
Skeptics have argued that lower dependence on energy imports will cause the US to disengage from the Middle East.
But this misreads the economics of energy.
A major disruption such as a war or terrorist attack that stopped the flow of oil and gas through the Strait of Hormuz would drive prices to very high levels in America and among our allies in Europe and Japan.
Besides, the US has many interests other than oil in the region, including nonproliferation of nuclear weapons, protection of Israel, human rights, and counterterrorism.
The US may be cautious about overextending itself in the Middle East, but that reflects its experience with the costly invasion of Iraq and the general turmoil of the Arab Spring revolutions, rather than illusions that shale produces political “energy independence.”
America’s ability to use oil sanctions to force Iran to negotiate an end to its nuclear-weapons program depended not only on Saudi willingness to make up Iran’s exports of a million barrels per day, but also on the general expectations that the shale revolution created.
Other benefits of shale energy for US foreign policy include the diminishing ability of countries like Venezuela to use oil to purchase votes at the United Nations and in regional organizations of small Caribbean states, and Russia’s reduced ability to coerce its neighbors by threatening to cut off gas supplies.
In short, there has been a tectonic shift in the geopolitics of energy.
Although no one can know the future of energy prices, modest world prices may last for some time.
Both technology and politics could of course upend this prediction.
Technological advances could increase supply and reduce prices; politics is more likely to disrupt supply and cause prices to rise.
But the disruptions are unlikely to be sharp or long-lasting in the wake of the shale revolution, which is what makes it a geopolitical revolution as well.
Socrates in Silicon Valley
LONDON – If Socrates’s gadfly was in Silicon Valley, it would have a lot of lazy horses to sting.
The citizens of the techno-polis appear oblivious to how the outside world’s perception of them has changed, and radically so.
Once universally revered as a hotbed of innovation, the world’s premier technology hub is increasingly viewed with suspicion and resentment.
Yes, Silicon Valley is still admired as a source of invention and creative destruction; but it is also widely viewed as having lost its ethical compass.
With proliferating reports of lax attitudes toward data privacy, wanton disregard for the dignity of the less fortunate, and a growing sense that technology companies are pushing their preferred policy agenda on the rest of the world, discontent and disillusion are rising.
Viewed from outside, the world sees companies that exude a sense of entitlement – for example, by flouting local regulations as they expand into cities around the world, from Berlin to Rio de Janeiro.
Supremely confident in the power of their knowledge and skills, they are convinced that they will guide the world onto the Path of Truth.
This overweening certitude is not new – the United States, after all, was founded on missionary zeal – but the ethical arrogance is.
Of course, not all technology companies should be tarred with the same brush as the main offenders.
But the recent spate of high-profile cases harms the reputation of the sector as a whole.
As the world looks to Silicon Valley and sees an echo chamber of self-righteous conceit, mature and law-abiding technology companies are assumed to be inside it, too.
The cases are becoming legion.
Uber, the data-abusing car-sharing app that spikes prices during peak demand and threatens journalists who write negatively about it, has been banned in Spain, the Netherlands, Thailand, and two Indian cities so far, including New Delhi (after a driver allegedly raped a passenger).
These reports follow the revelation that pictures shared on Snapchat may not be deleted, as promised.
In August, Brazilian authorities banned the social-networking app Secret after the company failed to respond to cyberbullying concerns, with Israel considering a similar move.
The list goes on.
Silicon Valley is risking a backlash that will not do anyone any good.
Its leaders are increasingly out of step with the public’s expectation of ethical and conscientious behavior.
If they fail to generate new ideas and devise novel approaches, their problems will only multiply further.
One thing that would help is fresh blood.
Much of Silicon Valley’s success stems from its tight networks – people who have been successful and support one another.
But history shows that the same structures can also choke off innovation.
Organizations, like species, become inbred and weak, and eventually perish, when they fail to embrace diversity.
Indeed, one of the most revealing facts to come to light about Silicon Valley in recent months is the extreme ethnic and gender imbalance at large technology companies, including Apple, Google, Facebook, and Twitter.
No one is shocked, but clearly something needs to change.
Somehow a place that prides itself on innovation and doing things differently should be doing this differently as well.
Above all, there is value in questioning and challenging the status quo.
Independence in thought and deed is vital for any company to function and to build things that last and contribute to economic growth and prosperity.
In Plato’s Apology, Socrates advocates for the examined life – the habit of rigorous self-reflection and posing hard, heterodox, and possibly upsetting questions.
The tech sector needs to embrace that credo.
Ironically, questioning prevailing wisdom – and thereby inventing radically new solutions – has been Silicon Valley’s modus operandi from the outset.
But it has followed this approach on a macro level and for problems elsewhere in the economy, without examining itself.
Silicon Valley’s citizens must start applying their skill at innovation – and their pride in “breaking things” – to themselves.
The only way to evolve is by adapting to new environmental pressures, and now Silicon Valley – owing in large part to its own behavior – is facing plenty of them.
Unless it changes, it will be overtaken.
The good news is that if any place has proved that it can innovate, it is Silicon Valley.
Now, however, its citizens must recognize that they do not have all the answers; unfortunately, so far at least, there seems to be no awareness among them that there is even a problem.
Like the “skilled craftsmen” described by Socrates, “on the strength of their technical proficiency, they claimed a perfect understanding of every other subject, however important.”
As Plato’s teacher knew – and as every fresh report of the tech sector’s abusive behavior should remind us – a little knowledge can be a dangerous thing.
The Harsh Truth About India’s Godmen
NEW DELHI – Late last month, when two Indian states and the national capital were held to ransom by rioting mobs protesting their spiritual leader’s conviction on two counts of raping minor girls, many Indians found themselves confronting several painful truths about their country.
The leader who spurred these protests is Gurmeet Singh, one of the more prominent of several “godmen,” or self-proclaimed spiritual leaders, who flourish across India.
The flamboyant, jewelry-bedecked Singh calls himself Baba Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh Insan – a compound of Hindu, Muslim, and Sikh names, followed by the word for “Human” in Hindi, Punjabi, and Urdu.
And he has a reputation for sexually exploiting his female followers.
In 2002, two of those followers mustered the courage to press charges.
In the 15 years and 200 sittings of the court it took to get to a conviction, Singh’s devotees made numerous efforts to pressure investigators, police, judges, and the complainants to withdraw the case.
But they did not surrender, and last month, Singh was given a 20-year prison sentence.
Singh was always a peculiar godman, eschewing spiritual asceticism for gaudy showmanship and ostentatious living.
He liked his hair long, his motorcycles powerful, his cars expensive, his attire sequined, and his women clingy.
He performed in popular music videos of his own composition – his biggest hit is called “Love Charger” – and had a feature film made about himself called MSG: The Messenger of God.
It is estimated that this unlikely “Rockstar Baba” attracted tens of millions of fanatical worshippers to his Dera Sacha Sauda movement.
And with the help of his henchmen, he kept the flock together in ruthlessly effective ways.
Most notably, a crusading small-town journalist who reported the rape complaint against him was murdered in 2002.
Over the years, Dera Sacha Sauda amassed a significant land bank and real-estate assets, and enjoyed considerable influence in the states of Punjab and Haryana, with its reach extending to Delhi.
It also fulfilled a fundamental need in Northern Indian society: to give millions an identity, a standing in society, and a sense of security that they and their families had not previously known.
Dera members are overwhelmingly Sikhs.
A key message of Sikhism – equality among the faithful – has in the past inspired people from the lower Hindu castes to convert.
But so deep is the prejudice in Indian society that many converted Sikhs found that their new co-religionists of higher castes, who dominate the faith’s official religious bodies, treated them no better than Hindus had.
Faced with an entrenched status quo, many Sikhs of less privileged backgrounds became disillusioned.
Their feelings of anger and helplessness, compounded by poor education and soaring unemployment, often drove them toward alcohol and drugs.
For these desperate people, the Dera Sacha Sauda and its charismatic leader – not to mention the several other, mostly smaller Deras dotting Punjab and Haryana – emerged as saviors.
The Dera offered free education to its members and their children and free food for the hungry.
It kept the faithful off drugs, and provided employment in its enterprises, offering not only a livelihood, but also a sense of meaning and purpose.
It thus delivered to its followers that most precious and intangible of human needs: a sense of worth and belonging.
Politicians played along with the Deras, which helped to maintain social peace, tamp down discontent, and channel frustrations toward constructive activity.
The Deras helped reduce addiction, replaced anomie with community, and redirected despair to divinity.
So, rather than repudiate them as dangerous cults, successive governments rushed to embrace them.
The loyalty the Deras inspire among their members should not be underestimated.
There is, of course, the religious fervor that accompanies affiliation with a spiritual guru.
But at the heart of a Dera’s appeal is social and economic security, the ability to fulfill people’s basic needs.
In Singh’s case, where government and civil society failed, an apparent charlatan succeeded.
That success mattered far more than Singh’s flaws.
People who were willing to lend their wives and daughters to their guru, for the sake of the security he offered, could not understand why the same “blessing,” extended to the two girls, should land him in jail.
As a commenter put it on Facebook, “a lost man doesn’t care if a rapist gives him direction.
A hungry man will take food from a murderer’s hand.”
The resistance by Dera followers to their guru’s conviction exposed their fears that without him and his organization, they might once again face social and economic marginalization.
They identify intensely with him, whatever he does.
They are willing to kill for him, because, as they might see it, they would really be killing for themselves.
That commitment was apparent in the rioting and destruction that followed Singh’s conviction, in which 30 people were killed, dozens of vehicles burned, several buildings (including two new hotels) set ablaze, train carriages wrecked, and roads blocked, paralyzing life across an important swath of northern India for several days.
Many Indians lament that such blind religious devotion should thrive in their country in the second decade of the twenty-first century.
But the violence raises far more troubling questions than that.
The episode shows that India’s much-touted economic development has shallow roots, as it has failed to deliver caste equality and social justice to the underclasses.
It shows that official institutions of governance will all too readily delegate their responsibilities, enabling those who run religious orders to live above the law.
It shows the fragility of law enforcement, which failed so spectacularly in the face of mass fury.
And it shows the hold of charismatic leaders over vast numbers of people who find validation and purpose in unthinking obeisance.
Baba Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh Insan was flown to prison in a luxurious helicopter with an “adopted daughter” in devoted attendance; he nibbled abstractedly at a piece of chocolate as a police escort carried his bags.
The Baba may be in jail – but Indian society is still in the dock.
To Manage Expectations, Central Banks Need Social Media Savvy
LONDON – As global economic growth gathers pace, with the International Monetary Fund reporting that all of the G20 countries are now in an expansion phase, we are at last entering a process of normalization of interest rates and monetary policy.
That shift has been a long time coming, and in 2008 few would have forecast that the impact of the financial crisis that erupted that year would be so durable.
It is fair to say that policy normalization is proceeding at different speeds in different places.
The US Federal Reserve is furthest ahead, having already lifted rates twice, while in the Eurozone and Japan, normalization is more anticipated than experienced.
But the general direction of change is clear.
In the Fed’s “Semiannual Monetary Policy Report to the Congress,” Fed Chair Janet Yellen forecast “gradual increases in the federal funds rate.”
At the same time, the Fed is already reducing its holdings of US Treasury bills and mortgage bonds.
In other words, so-called quantitative easing (QE) is being replaced in the US by QT, or quantitative tightening.
The European Central Bank has been less clear about its intentions, but has sounded notably more optimistic about growth in the eurozone, noting that all the job losses associated with the crisis have now been offset.
A tapering of eurozone QE is now widely expected.
For the Bank of England (BoE), Governor Mark Carney has emphasized the need to raise rates in the near future, given that UK inflation is well above target.
But it is clear that central bankers are nervous about moving rapidly, and are worried about the potential impact of policy tightening on financial markets.
They are right to be anxious.
Interest rates have been ultra-low for a long time.
The last upward move in London was a decade ago.
For most of today’s inhabitants of bank trading floors, that is ancient history.
So one can sense that the monetary authorities are very concerned to prepare the ground for their next moves.
They are persuaded that influencing expectations is critical.
If markets expect a move, some of the needed adjustments will take place in advance, reducing the potential cost of change.
Central bankers have done a decent job of managing market expectations, certainly in the United States.
There cannot be many people in the financial sector who will be surprised if the Fed raises rates again this year.
Preparing opinion for a move is more complicated in the United Kingdom.
The voting system used by the BoE’s Monetary Policy Committee makes it harder for the governor to know when a majority for tightening will emerge, and some members’ views have been oscillating in recent months.
Still, Carney has been doing his best to drop heavy hints about his own intentions.
But although financial markets may be prepared, can we say the same of individuals, households, and small businesses?
Consumer debt remains high in many places, and certainly in the UK there are few signs that the prospect of higher interest rates is dissuading consumers from taking on more debt.
There is clearly a risk that consumers may react more sharply to rate increases when they eventually occur.
Of course, central banks do not normally speak directly to consumers.
They must rely on their messages being passed through several hands, including broadcasters and personal finance journalists, before they reach the high street.
The BoE has made some recent efforts to address consumers, but its direct reach is inevitably modest.
And there is evidence that communications by central banks are not well suited to the consumer market.
In an intriguing recent speech, Andy Haldane, the BoE’s chief economist, marshals survey evidence on how well central banks are understood by the populations they are trying to influence.
Researchers have looked at the reading level required to understand central banks’ publications, and at the percentage of the population that reads at that level.
The results are alarming.
While about 70% of the population can understand a campaign speech by Donald Trump, and 60% can grasp the significance of the lyrics of an Elvis Presley song, only 2% have the reading ability necessary to understand the minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee.
Now one might reasonably say that no one should expect Joe or Joanna Blow to spend their Saturday evenings reading FOMC minutes.
But only slightly more than 20% can understand what the mainstream press writes about monetary policy.
And this is a problem not only for the Fed.
The minutes of the BoE’s Monetary Policy Committee are somewhat more demotic in style, but not much more.
The Campaign for Plain English, a lobbying group, has described the Bank’s statements as “worthless, impenetrable waffle.”
There are no comparable statistics or verdicts for the ECB, but I would be surprised if the results were any different.
The results are a disappointment to central bankers, who, to their credit, have been enhancing their communications in recent years.
Not so long ago, a BoE governor took pride in clouding decisions in decent obscurity.
In the last 20 years, that curmudgeonly attitude has vanished.
But, as Haldane concludes, further effort is needed.
People get their news in different ways nowadays, and central banks, he says, “must ensure they reach the parts of society they previously have not reached, using media they have not previously used, conversing as much as convincing.”
Trump has shown that he can do it, albeit often with deleterious results.
The Fed chair appointed early next year, whether Yellen or a new nominee, should consider following the communications trail Trump has blazed.
The Authoritarian Temptation
NEW YORK – Twenty-four years ago this month, Soviet hardliners, desperate to stop the country’s nascent democratic transition, arrested Mikhail Gorbachev and declared martial law.
In response, millions of protesters poured into the streets of Moscow and towns across the Soviet Union.
Key elements of the army refused to accept the coup, and it soon collapsed – with the Soviet Union soon to follow.
Even though economic conditions were dire in the USSR’s final months, people could see the freedoms that were coming and, unlike today, were willing to stand up for them.
Indeed, in the early years of the democratic transition that followed, most post-communist voters did not succumb to the temptation to elect extremists who promised to end the hard times they were enduring.
Instead, they usually chose the most sensible candidate available.
Russians, for example, rejected Vladimir Zhirinovsky, a clownish Donald Trump-like nationalist and anti-Semite, in favor of Boris Yeltsin, who had stared down tanks during the failed 1991 coup and recognized that his country’s future lay with democracy and the West.
In Romania, the extremist poet Corneliu Vadim Tudor lost to a succession of corrupt pragmatists, beginning with Ion Iliescu, who had led the ouster of the country’s last communist leader, Nicolae Ceaușescu.
Since then, the world has been turned upside down.
As life has gotten easier, with people’s material expectations largely met, voters have increasingly favored neo-autocrats who promise to “protect” the people from this or that threat.
Russian President Vladimir Putin, of course, leads this group, but there are also Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán and Czech President Miloš Zeman.
And the trend extends beyond the former communist countries to include, for example, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.
The French philosopher Jean-François Revel saw the rise of violent dictatorships in the twentieth century as driven by a “totalitarian temptation.”
What we are witnessing today is something a bit less sinister – call it an “authoritarian temptation.”
But it is a growing threat not only to democracy, but also to global stability.
After all, the one thing today’s autocrats have in common with their totalitarian predecessors is contempt for the rule of law, both domestically and internationally.
One cause for this shift toward authoritarianism is that many countries no longer view the United States as a beacon of democracy and a model of stability and prosperity to be emulated.
Putin’s claim that democratization is actually an American plot “to gain unilateral advantages” resonates with many societies following the disastrous invasion of Iraq and revelations about the National Security Agency’s spying on citizens and leaders worldwide.
But even before these developments, the Cold War’s winners – and especially the US – were showing a boastfulness that probably alienated many.
When even allies are treated with disrespect – recall George W. Bush’s infamous shout of “Yo, Blair,” as if then-British Prime Minister Tony Blair were some cowhand – people naturally wonder whether their country, too, is deemed subservient.
Rising “soft” dictators – what the journalist Bobby Ghosh calls authoritarian democrats – have used these feelings of unease and alienation to attract votes.
Their supporters do not want to be oppressed, but they do want stability and national sovereignty – desires that their leaders fulfill partly by limiting opposition.
Given the reach of today’s mass media and social networks, only a few people must be targeted to cow the rest of society into conforming to the leader’s vision.
So, instead of building gulags, neo-authoritarians launch criminal cases.
The defendants range from political opponents and critics in Russia – such as the oil oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky and the anti-corruption lawyer Alexei Navalny – to independent journalists in Erdoğan’s Turkey.
Citizens seem convinced.
At least 70% of Russians agree with Putin that this kind of “managed democracy” is superior to the chaotic version practiced in the West.
Almost half of Hungary’s citizens find membership in the European Union, whose liberal values Orbán mocks, unnecessary.
And more than 70% of Turks have a negative view of the US, which Erdoğan blames for the rise of social media (the “worst menace” facing Turkey today – trumping, it seems, even the Islamic State’s deadly attacks in Turkish cities).
When the Berlin Wall fell in 1989, people did not understand the link between capitalism and democracy.
Many wanted a Western lifestyle, with access to the kinds of jobs and goods available in the US, but seemed not to recognize that access to that lifestyle requires increased economic and personal freedom – precisely the kind of freedom that underpins democratic societies.
If, in the current environment, Western powers attempted to point this out to the people of Russia, Hungary, or Turkey, they would likely stoke even greater resentment.
The better option would be to work on the countries’ leaders.
If the Putins, Erdoğans, and Orbáns of the world want to continue to benefit economically from the open international system, they cannot simply make up their own rules.
The power of such an approach can be seen in Russia, where Western sanctions, imposed following Putin’s annexation of Crimea, are the main factor limiting the pro-Russian rebels’ incursion in eastern Ukraine.
Putin’s efforts to reclaim “great power” status for Russia may find support among his people; but that support will probably dwindle if Russians face the prospect of losing all of the comforts derived from the relatively open economy that their country has had for more than two decades.
At a time when more and more Russians are being denied passports to travel outside the country, those tempted by authoritarianism would do well to recall the elementary point made by John F. Kennedy in his Berlin speech in 1963.
“Freedom has many difficulties, and democracy is not perfect,” Kennedy said.
“But we never had to put up a wall to keep our people in.”
The Solar Price Revolution
POTSDAM – A silent revolution is under way.
In November, Dubai announced the construction of a solar energy park that will produce electricity for less than $0.06 per kilowatt-hour – undercutting the cost of the alternative investment option, a gas or coal-fired power plant.
The plant – which is expected to be operational in 2017 – is yet another harbinger of a future in which renewable energy crowds out conventional fossil fuels.
Indeed, hardly a week seems to pass without news of a major deal to construct a solar power plant.
In February alone, there were announcements of new solar power projects in Nigeria (1,000 megawatts), Australia (2,000 MW), and India (10,000 MW).
There can be no doubting that these developments are good for the fight against climate change.
But the major consideration driving them is profit, not the environment, as increased efficiency in energy distribution and, where necessary, storage, reduces the cost of producing renewable energy.
As efforts to improve the management of electricity from fluctuating sources yield further advances, the cost of solar power will continue to fall.
Within ten years, it will be produced in many regions around the globe for 4-6 cents per kilowatt-hour, according to a recent study by the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems (commissioned by the think tank Agora Energiewende).
By 2050, production costs will fall to 2-4 cents per kilowatt-hour.
As Patrick Graichen, Agora’s executive director, points out, most forecasts of the world’s future energy supply fail to take into account solar power’s looming victory over its fossil-fuel competitors.
Updating them would paint a realistic picture of the costs and impact of our energy production and consumption on the world’s climate, reveal the importance of renewable energy to economic development, and enable better planning of energy infrastructure.
We should not underestimate the tremendous potential the sun and wind have for building global wealth and fighting poverty.
As solar power becomes increasingly cost-effective, countries located within the planet’s sun belt could develop entirely new business models as cheap, clean energy enables them to process their raw materials locally, adding value – and profit – prior to export.
Unlike large-scale conventional power plants, solar installations can be built in months; in addition to being cost-effective, they provide a quick means of responding to growing global demand.
And, because solar plants can generally be operated independently of complex interregional electricity grids, they provide less developed countries a way to electrify their economies without building expensive new infrastructure.
Solar power plants thus could play the same role for energy that mobile phones did for telecommunications: rapidly reaching large, underserved communities in sparsely populated regions, without the need to invest in the cables and accompanying infrastructure that once would have been necessary.
In Africa, 66% of the population has gained access to electronic communications since 2000.
There is no reason why solar power could not do likewise for access to electricity.
The time to invest in large-scale solar energy production is now.
For starters, construction costs for solar power plants are finally low enough to produce electricity at a competitive, stable price for more than 25 years.
The price of oil may have plunged for now, but it will rise again.
Solar power plants provide insurance against fossil fuels’ inherent price volatility.
Even more important, the cost of capital currently is very low in many countries.
This is a decisive factor for the economic viability of solar power plants, because they need very little maintenance but require relatively high upfront investment.
The Fraunhofer study shows that differences in capital expenditure are as important for costs per kilowatt-hour as differences in sunlight.
Solar power is currently cheaper in cloudy Germany than in sunny regions where the cost of borrowing is higher.
The amount of sunlight that shines on a country is impossible to change.
But the cost of capital is something over which a country can maintain a certain amount of control.
By creating a stable legal framework, providing credit guarantees in the context of international agreements, and involving central banks in large-scale investments, governments can help to make solar power more accessible.
Factors like these explain why international climate policies increasingly focus not only on solar power, but on other forms of renewable energy as well.
Technological breakthroughs have boosted these energy sources’ competitiveness relative to fossil fuels.
As a result, instruments that make their adoption more affordable are becoming some of the most important weapons we have in the fight against climate change.
Saving Somalia Through Debt Relief
LONDON – Julius Nyerere, the first president of Tanzania, once asked his country’s creditors a blunt question: “Must we starve our children to pay our debts?”
That was in 1986, before the public campaigns and initiatives that removed much of Africa’s crushing and unpayable debt burden.
But Nyerere’s question still hangs like a dark cloud over Somalia.
Over the last year, an unprecedented humanitarian effort has pulled Somalia back from the brink of famine.
As the worst drought in living memory destroyed harvests and decimated livestock, almost $1 billion was mobilized in emergency aid for nutrition, health, and clean water provision.
That aid saved many lives and prevented a slow-motion replay of the 2011 drought, when delayed international action resulted in nearly 260,000 deaths.
Yet, even after these recent efforts, Somalia’s fate hangs in the balance.
Early warning systems are pointing to a prospective famine in 2018.
Poor and erratic rains have left 2.5 million people facing an ongoing food crisis; some 400,000 children live with acute malnutrition; food prices are rising; and dry wells have left communities dependent on expensive trucked water.
Humanitarian aid remains essential.
Almost half of Somalia’s 14 million people need support, according to UN agencies. But humanitarian aid, which is often volatile and overwhelmingly short-term, will not break the deadly cycles of drought, hunger, and poverty.
If Somalia is to develop its health and education systems, economic infrastructure, and the social protection programs needed to build a more resilient future, it needs predictable, long-term development finance.
Debt represents a barrier to that finance.
Somalia’s external debt is running at $5 billion.
Creditors range from rich countries like the United States, France, and Italy, to regional governments and financial institutions, including the Arab Monetary Fund.
But Somalia’s debt also includes $325 million in arrears owed to the International Monetary Fund.
And there’s the rub: countries in arrears to the IMF are ineligible to receive long-term financing from other sources, including the World Bank’s $75 billion concessional International Development Association (IDA) facility.
Much of the country’s current debt dates to the Cold War, when the world’s superpower rivalry played out in the Horn of Africa.
Over 90% of Somalia’s debt burden is accounted for by arrears on credit advanced in the early 1980s, well before two-thirds of today’s Somali population was born.
Most of the lending then was directed to President Siad Barre as a reward for his abandonment of the Soviet Union and embrace of the West.
Military credits figured prominently: over half of the $973 million in US debt is owed to the Department of Defense.
Somalia got state-of-the-art weaponry, liberally financed by loans.
The IMF was nudged into guaranteeing repayment through a structural adjustment program.  Repaying the debt today would cost every Somali man, woman, and child $361.
None of this would matter if Somalia had qualified for debt reduction.
The Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative (HIPC), created in response to the great debt relief campaigns of the 1990s, has written off around $77 billion in debt for 36 countries.
Somalia is one of just three countries that have yet to qualify.
The reason: the arrears owed to the IMF.
(Eritrea and Sudan have also not qualified, for similar reasons).
The IMF view is that Somalia, like earlier HIPC beneficiaries, should establish a track record of economic reform.
This will delay a full debt write-off for up to three years, exclude Somalia from long-term development finance, and reinforce its dependence on emergency aid.
Other creditors have endorsed this approach through silent consent.
Somalia deserves better.
President Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed’s government has demonstrated a commitment to economic reform, improved accountability, and transparency.
For two years, it has adhered to an IMF program, achieving targets for improving public finance and the banking sector.
More needs to be done, especially in terms of domestic resource mobilization.
But this is the first Somali government to provide the international community with a window of opportunity to support recovery.
We must capitalize on it.
Waiting three more years as Somalia ticks the IMF’s internal accounting boxes would be a triumph of bureaucratic complacency over human needs.
Without international support, Somalia’s government lacks the resources needed to break the deadly cycle of drought, hunger, and poverty.
Somalia’s children need investment in health, nutrition, and schools now, not at some point in the indefinite future.
Investing in irrigation and water management would boost productivity.
With drought-related livestock and crop losses estimated at around $1.5 billion, government-supported cash payment programs would help aid recovery, strengthen resilience, and build trust.
The benefits of these investments would extend to security.
Providing the hope that comes with education, health care, and the prospect of a job is a far more effective weapon than a drone to combat an insurgency that feeds on despair, poverty, joblessness, and the absence of basic services.
There is an alternative to IMF-sponsored inertia on debt relief.
The World Bank and major creditors could convene a creditor summit to agree to terms for a prompt debt write-off.
More immediately, the World Bank could seek its shareholders’ approval for a special mechanism – a “pre-arrears clearance grant” – that would enable Somalia to receive IDA financing.
There is a precedent for this: In 2005, the US championed World Bank financing for Liberia, which at the time had significant IMF debt after emerging from civil war.
The technicalities can be discussed and the complexities resolved.
But we should not lose sight of what is at stake.
It is indefensible for the IMF and other creditors to obstruct Somalia’s access to financing because of arrears on a debt incurred three decades ago as much through reckless lending as through irresponsible borrowing.
Somalia’s children played no part in creating that debt.
They should not have to pay for it with their futures.
Boosting South Africa’s Diversity Dividend
CAPE TOWN – After an insight-filled and enjoyable visit to South Africa – my first to this beautiful country in 15 years – I am leaving with mixed feelings.
The country’s ongoing process of economic and political development has left those living here, as well as concerned observers like me, both hopeful and worried about the future.
A quarter-century ago, South Africa embarked on its extraordinary transition away from nearly 50 years of stifling apartheid, by following Nelson Mandela’s principled vision to “forgive but never forget.”
When its black majority was finally given a say in governance, it elected an African National Congress (ANC) government that, by refraining from confiscating and nationalizing private property held by the privileged minority, distinguished the country from many others, in Africa and elsewhere, that have emerged from repressive colonial rule.
Instead, the Mandela-led government recognized the country’s diversity as a potential source of long-term unity and wellbeing, and decided to pursue a remarkably inclusive approach.
This model has inspired many others outside of South Africa, not least in countries still ruled by authoritarian regimes that use fear tactics to maintain their grip on power.
Mandela’s approach showed that orderly and inclusive transitions are possible, and that previously suppressed and imprisoned freedom advocates can transform themselves to form a legitimate and effective government.
But the outcomes of South Africa’s transition are far from perfect.
Today, growth is insufficiently inclusive and far too slow, with the annual GDP growth barely positive last year.
The country’s Gini coefficient is one of the worst in the world, reflecting stark levels of income inequality; its rate of unemployment, at 26.5%, is alarmingly high and hits young people the hardest; and too many people are stuck in disastrous poverty cycles.
Poor governance has undoubtedly contributed to this disappointing situation, which falls short of what Mandela envisioned for the country he loved.
Among other things, the government has mismanaged public finances, and it has stumbled in its pursuit of a new economic-growth model.
At the same time, falling commodity prices in recent years have only added to the economy’s economic and monetary challenges.
With the country performing well below its considerable potential, “black economic empowerment” efforts that are meant to reduce historical inequalities have suffered.
But public-sector shortfalls, which have become more visible and better understood recently, are not the only reason for this.
Another, less visible problem is that private businesses’ own efforts to ensure diversity have not gained sufficient traction.
South African companies are not the only ones to struggle in this area.
In fact, much of the business community around the world, including in the West, is still trying to figure out how to make inclusion and diversity programs successful, including with respect to leveling a playing field that is still tilted against women.
Research has shown that inclusion is good for business.
As a result, many Western companies recognize that introducing more diversity into the decision-making process at most levels will boost their resilience and agility.
But they are still struggling to overcome blind spots and biases, both conscious and unconscious, stemming from structural and behavioral obstacles that women face, especially when trying to secure senior positions for which they are amply qualified.
As Harvard University’s Mahzarin Banaji, for example, has demonstrated, companies fall victim to blind spots and unconscious biases for a variety of reasons.
These include the manner by which our brains have evolved, childhood exposures and experiences, historical interactions, and heuristic shortcuts that we unconsciously use to interpret information and frame issues.
Countering these factors will require companies to figure out how to sustain the heightened states of awareness and understanding that bring biases to light.
South African companies, particularly in the financial sector, can no longer pay only lip service to inclusion.
They will need to implement behavioral nudges, and modify corporate structures in order to encourage more inclusive, merit-based behaviors.
CEOs and senior management teams must revamp their operations, remind their colleagues of the strong business case for diversity, and make a much stronger effort to identify, train, and mentor talented individuals of all races.
Specifically, they should expand individual and collective apprentice-based and vocational programs, modernize their methods for measuring performance, and intensify their efforts to include recent research on the benefits of cognitive diversity and “superadditivity” in internal and external communications.
We should all be on guard against the risk of outdated influences affecting our behaviors and decisions.
As I argued in my recent book The Only Game in Town, “No company and certainly no country will be able to harvest its realizable potential if it fails to embrace and empower human talent regardless of gender, race, culture, sexual orientation, and perspectives.”
South Africa will need much more than improved economic governance if it is to overcome its challenges and unleash its full potential in an increasingly uncertain global economy.
Rather than waiting for the politicians to do something about it, South African businesses should deepen their engagement with ever-broader segments of the population.
Doing so would not only improve productivity, competitiveness, and business results over time. It would also help to reduce the violence that accompanies marginalization, hopelessness, and alienation.
South Africa’s Rhino Paradox
JOHANNESBURG – Earlier this year, South Africa’s Constitutional Court overturned a 2009 moratorium on trade in rhinoceros horns.
It was a devastating blow for animal conservation groups, which had hailed a measure that aligned South Africa with the global ban on the trade in effect since 1977.
But as the court’s ruling sinks in, commercial breeders and animal rights groups face a crucial question: could the creation of a legal market for farmed horns curb a poaching pandemic that claims some 1,500 wild rhinos annually?
For South Africa’s rhino industry, the court’s decision was a watershed.
John Hume, the world’s most successful rhino breeder, hosted the country’s first online horn auction in August.
Writing on the auction’s website, he argued that “the demand for rhino horn is high, and open trading of the horn has the potential to satisfy this demand to prevent rhino poaching.”
Opponents of the trade say demand for horns could increase as a result of legalization, reviving dormant interest.
This growth could outpace commercial supply, and even fuel more illegal poaching of wild animals.
Critics also worry that ending the ban will remove any lingering stigma associated with possessing rhino horn, further boosting demand.
Breeders and traders like Hume concede that demand “is not going to die down anytime soon.”
But they argue that because horns are a renewable resource – they grow back when trimmed, albeit slowly – what South Africa actually needs are incentives to encourage responsible breeding and conservation.
“If we do not take the steps to meet the demand,” Hume argues, “we won’t save the rhino.”
We still do not know how the court’s decision will affect demand for a resource that is prized throughout Asia for its medicinal value.
What is clear, however, is that placing too much trust in a commercial conservation approach is risky.
Evidence suggests that while farming of rhinos may have niche market possibilities, it will not prevent poaching of wild rhinos.
Similar efforts to protect wild animals through farming have fallen short.
For example, a 2010 study in Vietnam found that commercial farming of the Southeast Asian porcupine, a popular meat source, had not dramatically reduced the hunting of wild porcupines.
It is the same story for elephant ivory, bear bile, and mule deer musk.
Demand for wild products often far exceeds what commercial breeding can realistically offer.
Commercial breeding programs are further disadvantaged because of the perception among some buyers that wild products are more valuable.
As University of Johannesburg scientist Laura Tensen has noted, “wild animals are considered superior because of their rarity and high expense.”
That is especially true for rhinos.
Poachers often prove the veracity of their illicit product by showing buyers horns that have been removed from the base of the skull, an extraction method that kills the animal.
Only the most conscience-stricken consumer would ensure that horns they purchase are sourced from licensed breeders.
Historically, poaching has also been immune to fluctuations in the retail price of rhino horns.
For the price mechanism to eradicate poaching, demand would need to bottom out.
With demand actually increasing, and without a threshold price to encourage breeding, supply-side interventions are unlikely to be effective in protecting wild rhinos.
Currently, rhino horn sells for as much as $60,000 per kilogram in parts of Asia.
Breeders are convinced that with permitting systems and detection technologies, legal horns could be identified, law enforcement could prevent illegal horns from being trafficked, and domestic trading could reduce the stress on wild populations.
But these arguments hinge on a number of conditions that are, at the moment, purely aspirational.
For starters, commercial breeding will succeed only if farmed horns are viewed as a substitute for products sourced from wild animals.
But as researchers like Tensen report, that is unlikely in the near term, given the higher status associated with non-farmed products.
Law-enforcement efforts would also need to be increased to detect illegal supplies and break up laundering rings.
Unfortunately, the illegal syndicates that smuggle wildlife products, often with assistance from government officials, are adept at evading detection.
Finally, the pro-farming argument assumes that commercial breeders will eventually supply horn at lower prices than poachers.
But captive breeding is costly.
Scientists at the University of California, San Diego, for example, have shown that white rhinos rarely produce fertile offspring in captivity.
Furthermore, the horns of young adults grow by only about six centimeters a year, and that rate diminishes with age.
Commercial breeders dispute that their operations amount to “captivity,” and Hume’s model is meant to replicate wild conditions as much as possible.
Yet if farmed solutions were ever to be seen as an alternative to wild harvesting, other breeders would need to replicate such conditions.
The cost would be significant, and corners would no doubt be cut.
While breeders are eager to defend their trade, economists have debunked the myth that a legal domestic market in rhino horns will conserve wild populations.
Even if farmed supplies from South Africa satisfied a portion of the demand globally, it will not alter demand among consumers drawn to wild product, or those who are indifferent about the source.
South Africa will most likely soon be home to parallel markets, with extensive laundering of illegal horn.
That may be acceptable to breeders, but it defies reason for those trying to conserve wild rhinos.
South Korea’s Looming Crisis
SEOUL – Twenty years after the Asian financial crisis, South Korea seems to have learned its lesson, having taken great pains to strengthen its economic resilience.
But now the country is confronting a new set of internal and external risks, which may foreshadow another major economic crisis – or worse.
Given the ongoing nuclear crisis with North Korea, a new bout of economic tumult is the last thing the country needs.
In July 1997, a currency crisis that struck Thailand quickly spread to neighboring economies.
South Korea was not hit right away, and many believed that it would be spared.
By that November, however, the country faced a sudden withdrawal of foreign capital, which, together with financial institutions’ inability to borrow from abroad, quickly depleted the country’s international reserves.
The following month, South Korea turned to the International Monetary Fund for assistance, and launched painful structural reforms.
Companies and financial institutions went bankrupt, and millions of jobs were lost.
In 1998, the economy contracted by 5.5%.
But things turned around a year later: GDP growth soared to 11.3%, and government-led reforms made progress toward addressing structural weaknesses, including an under-supervised financial system and an over-leveraged corporate sector.
As a result, the economy weathered the 2008 global financial crisis far better than most, foreign-exchange reserves far exceed short-term external liabilities, and companies and banks are financially sound.
In this respect, the Asian financial crisis amounted to a blessing in disguise for South Korea.
Yet South Korea is now beset by some of the same structural problems Japan faced during its two decades of stagnation: rapid population aging, labor-market inefficiency, institutional weakness, and low productivity in the service sector.
Demographic constraints are tightening.
South Korea’s fertility rate fell to 1.17 last year – one of the world’s lowest – and continues to decline.
Fourteen percent of the population is aged 65 or older, a figure that is expected to reach 28% by 2035.
As the labor force shrinks and the burden of supporting the elderly grows, the economy is losing vitality.
More problematic, however, are South Korea’s low labor-market efficiency and weak institutions.
According to the World Economic Forum’s latest global competitiveness report, South Korea ranks 73rd worldwide for labor-market efficiency, as a result of tight restrictions on employee-employer relations.
And it ranks 58th for institutional quality, owing to excessive government regulations, opaque corporate governance, and policy instability.
Finally, productivity in the services sector amounts to just 45% that of the manufacturing sector, on average, compared with an OECD average of 90%.
The problem is most acute in finance, real estate, business services, and community and government services.
Externally, South Korea is highly vulnerable to the escalating North Korean nuclear threat.
In recent months, North Korea has fired several ballistic missiles and conducted a nuclear test, spurring an exchange of incendiary rhetoric between North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and US President Donald Trump.
This war of words, in which both sides have threatened to launch “preemptive strikes,” is raising fears of a military conflict on the Korean Peninsula.
The United States is now attempting to pressure China to take responsibility for curbing the North Korean nuclear threat, with the US Treasury considering imposing sanctions on Chinese individuals, companies, and banks doing business with North Korea.
But while China has lately agreed to enforce economic sanctions more actively, it doesn’t want the North Korean regime to collapse.
Moreover, China has focused some of its ire on South Korea.
Beyond aggressively calling for the withdrawal of the US military’s Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system from South Korea, which it views as a threat to its own security and the region’s strategic balance, China is using its economic might to retaliate against the South.
In particular, as a result of China’s ban on group tours to South Korea, 49% fewer Chinese tourists visited the country in the first eight months of this year than in the same period last year.
Moreover, China accounts for 25% of South Korea’s total exports, giving it substantial leverage on trade.
Making matters worse, South Korea’s second-largest trading partner – the US, which accounts for 13% of all exports – is also putting pressure on the country.
Despite the critical importance of re-affirming the US-South Korea alliance, the Trump administration, concerned about the massive bilateral trade deficit, has threatened to renegotiate the bilateral free-trade agreement.
While the economic impact of such a move would be serious for South Korea’s export-dependent economy, the most urgent imperative is to avoid any military conflict on the Korean Peninsula.
To that end, South Korean President Moon Jae-in, a longtime advocate of the “Sunshine Policy” toward the North, wants to employ “balancing sanctions and dialogue.”
But, so far, South Korea has not managed to improve diplomatic relations with its own ally, the US, not to mention with China.
And it has gotten nowhere near reviving inter-Korean talks.
This failure has many Koreans scared.
Would the unpredictable Trump go so far as to sacrifice South Korea (and Japan) to save San Francisco?
The possibility is so bone-chilling that the South is now debating whether to develop its own nuclear weapons or bring US tactical nuclear bombs back to its territory.
Either approach would antagonize China, potentially leading to an armed clash on the Korean Peninsula.
In the 1990s, South Korea waited for matters to come to a head before responding.
This time, it must nip the incipient crisis in the bud.
That means accelerating domestic structural reforms to improve productivity, enhance labor-market efficiency, upgrade institutions, and foster a business environment that supports modern service industries and innovative start-ups.
It also means strengthening both economic and diplomatic ties with major countries, while working with the US and China, in particular, to end the North Korean nuclear standoff.
Neither agenda will be easy to pursue.
But South Korea’s future prosperity, if not its very survival, depends on its leaders’ efforts on both fronts in the months and years ahead.
Europe’s Return to Crisis?
BRUSSELS – Just four months ago, when the Europhile Emmanuel Macron was elected as France’s president, it seemed that the European Union could finally look forward to a period of calm.
But calm is the last thing one can see on the streets of Barcelona, where demonstrations in favor of Catalonian independence – a referendum on which was brutally suppressed by government forces – have been met with equally potent protests against it.
As Spain’s internal conflict escalates, a return to crisis in Europe may seem all but inevitable.
Yet what is happening on the ground in Spain actually indicates that the European economic recovery is strengthening, while highlighting the limits of what the EU can achieve.
The strength of the EU’s economic recovery is revealed by the absence of any significant financial-market reaction to the tumultuous scenes in Catalonia.
Had a similar situation arisen a few years ago, there would have been a run on Spanish government bonds, and Spain’s stock market would have tanked.
Today, however, markets are taking the country’s profound political uncertainty in stride.
This vote of confidence is built on solid foundations.
The entire eurozone economy is growing at respectable, albeit unspectacular, rates.
And the Spanish economy has been growing faster than the eurozone average, all while keeping its external accounts in slight surplus.
This means that Spain’s recovery is based on increasing supply, rather than rising domestic demand, as was the case during the pre-crisis construction boom.
Add to that the existence of eurozone institutions that can address temporary financing difficulties faced by banks or states, and it becomes clearer why Spain’s deep political crisis has not been accompanied by dangerous financial-market gyrations.
But the Catalonia crisis also underscores the limitations of the EU’s model of integration, which are rooted in the fact that the Union is ultimately based on the nation-state.
This model cannot be described as inter-governmental.
Rather, it is based on indirect implementation: almost everything the EU does and decides is carried out by national governments and their administrations.
This distinction can be seen most strikingly in the area of monetary policy, where the decision-making mechanism is definitely not intergovernmental: the European Central Bank’s Governing Council operates on the basis of a simple majority.
But the implementation mechanism is certainly indirect: once a decision is made, it is carried out by national central banks – an approach that can have important implications.
For example, the vast bond-buying operations nominally undertaken by the ECB in recent years have been handled largely by national central banks, which purchase their own governments’ bonds.
The European Court of Justice in Luxembourg – another common institution of crucial importance – also relies on a decision-making mechanism that is not inter-governmental.
Yet its judges are nominated by national governments, and national courts and administrations enforce its decisions.
A comparison with the United States highlights the weaknesses of this approach.
While the US Federal Reserve also has a regional structure, the individual District Reserve Banks cover several states and aren’t tied to any state government or institution.
Likewise, US Supreme Court justices are nominated by federal institutions (the Senate accepts or rejects nominees put forward by the president), not by state governments.
For the EU, relying on its member states to build common institutions was arguably the only way to start the integration process, given deep mistrust among countries that had fought so many brutal wars against one another.
And yet a union that relies on the nation-state, not just for implementation, but also for legitimacy, can function only as well as its individual members.
But, today, with most of them are beset by internal strife, that model is reaching its limits.
In Greece, weak administrative and judicial systems have impeded economic recovery.
In Poland and Hungary, “illiberal” governments are undermining judicial independence.
And in Spain, the political system seems incapable of resolving the conflict between the regional government of Catalonia, with its aspirations of greater self-determination, and the central government in Madrid, which argues that even considering the question would undermine the constitutional order.
Even Germany is facing internal political challenges.
Having lost about one-fifth of her voters in the recent federal election, Chancellor Angela Merkel will have to reckon with three unruly coalition partners during her fourth – and probably last – term.
As for Italy, opinion polls suggest that a majority of voters now support populist and/or Euroskeptic parties.
While outright Euroskeptic parties appear unlikely to gain power anywhere, these political shifts do not bode well for European integration.
The EU faces little outright hostility.
Today it is facing, instead, an “obstructionist indifference,” as many of its member states are increasingly preoccupied with their internal challenges, making European integration little more than a second thought throughout most of the continent.
Those EU leaders who do still want to advance integration can no longer count on the argument, used during the financial crisis, that there is no alternative.
And the permissive consensus of the first years of integration is long gone.
If further progress toward “ever-closer union” is to be made, Europe’s leaders will have to find a new model that can overcome their citizens’ deepening apathy.
The Resilience of Spanish Democracy
MADRID – The idea that “Spain is different” drove generations of romantic travelers across the Pyrenees to see for themselves, their imaginations stirred by visions of vibrant women and charming bandits.
But Spain is no longer just the defiant fist on the hip of Bizet’s cigar-making Carmen.
Despite the attention now focused on the Catalonia region’s secession bid , Spain now stands out among Western democracies in a few critical – and positive – ways.
Spain’s unique character can be seen in its response to terrorist attacks.
In the United Kingdom, the 2005 London bombings resulted in additional legal curbs on individual and group liberties.
Likewise, the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in the United States drove a series of changes to surveillance laws that made it easier for the government to spy on ordinary Americans, not to mention the Global War on Terror, which continues to wreak havoc in the Middle East.
By contrast, after the March 11, 2004, bombings of Madrid’s train system, which left nearly 200 dead, an “alliance of civilizations” arose in Spain to disarm extremism by building bridges with Islam.
This tolerant attitude toward the country’s Muslim minority endures to this day, despite another attack in August, on La Rambla, in the heart of Barcelona.
It also seems to be reflected in Spanish politics.
While recent elections in virtually all other European countries have featured strong showings by far-right populists – Germany’s Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) being the latest to make major gains – Spain (and neighboring Portugal) have remained seemingly immune.
Today, Spain enjoys considerable economic dynamism, with one of the highest growth rates in Europe.
But, in recent years, it has suffered economic pain and skyrocketing unemployment, which reached 27% in 2013.
According to conventional wisdom, the combination of economic hardship and immigration is a recipe for Euroskepticism and xenophobia.
Yet neither of the two major political forces that have emerged in Spain in recent years, Ciudadanos and Podemos, has so much as a whiff of right-wing authoritarian tendencies, nor anti-European bombast.
Indeed, Ciudadanos is a centrist, business-friendly party; Podemos represents discontented urban middle-class youth with a left-leaning ideological profile.
Both are vocally anti-racist and pro-immigrant.
Spain’s resilience to far-right populism probably has deep historical roots.
The country took shape during the Middle Ages in a dialectical process of interfaith relations, and its integration into the European Union stemmed from an overwhelming consensus on the need to suppress the ghosts of Francisco Franco’s dictatorship, following his death in 1975.
Of course, the memory of dictatorship does not always suppress nostalgia for quasi-fascist experiments.
Recollections of military rule in the 1970s haven’t curbed the rise of the far-right Golden Dawn in Greece; nor has the memory of Admiral Miklos Horthy’s quasi-fascist regime in interwar and World War II-era Hungary impeded support for Viktor Orbán’s illiberal, xenophobic regime.
In France, Marine Le Pen’s National Front is the child of the Vichy experiment, and in Germany, the AfD has overcome the legacy of Hitler.
The absence of such political nostalgia in Spain may be explained partly by the fact that a brutal three-year civil war preceded the establishment of Franco’s dictatorship in 1939.
That experience nurtured a strong pacifist sentiment among the Spanish public, which endures to this day.
Some 90% of Spaniards – more than any other Western population – opposed the Iraq War, which their government supported.
Spain’s unique resistance to right-wing populist forces may also reflect the nature of Spain’s transition to democracy after Franco’s death.
Conservative groupings, whose origins lay in Francoism, actually served as vital building blocks of Spain’s democracy.
Some, like the now-ruling People’s Party (PP), have over time shifted toward the center to become more typical conservative European parties, much like the UK’s Conservatives or Germany’s Christian Democratic Union.
Crucially, the PP has made this move without losing voters who lean further to the right – the kind of voters who presumably would lead a backlash of right-wing populism.
This differs sharply from the experience of the 1930s, when moderates’ failure to attract a large enough share of the Spanish right fueled deepening polarization and, ultimately, civil war.
This is not to say that Spain is a utopia of social unity.
On the contrary, the country is now confronted with a major challenge, as domestic forces – in particular, the would-be separatists of Catalonia’s autonomous regional government – attempt to dismember the country.
Yet the PP has staunchly defended Spanish unity, dismissing Catalonia’s independence referendum as unconstitutional and deploying police to stop the vote from taking place (at times in lamentably brutal ways).
The message is clear: the conflict in Spain is among natives, not against non-natives.
And, indeed, though immigrants represent about 10% of Spain’s population, immigration is simply not a contentious issue anywhere in the country – perhaps partly because a large share come from Latin America, and thus share cultural and linguistic traits with indigenous Spaniards.
The absence of any backlash against the one third of Spain’s immigrants who are Romanians and Moroccans probably reflects their low visibility in society.
Even as other European conservatives have flirted with anti-immigrant posturing in an attempt to stave off populist threats, Spain’s PP has done no such thing.
Meanwhile, its European credentials are strong.
In a country where, according to an Elcano/Demos study, only 10% of the population would want to leave the EU  – compared with 22% in France and 45% in the UK – this is unlikely to change.
For Europeans, Spain now represents a different kind of fantasy than in days past.
It demonstrates that, even as a country’s ethnic composition changes, as it faces terrorist attacks and a deep recession, it can resist the siren song of extremism.
The Disunited States of American Gun Control
LONDON – The Las Vegas massacre and its aftermath are pure Americana.
A deranged person lugs nearly two dozen high-tech assault weapons to a 32nd-floor hotel room to spray death upon concertgoers in a mass murder and suicide.
In response, the culture wars flare anew, with gun-control advocates in pitched battle against gun enthusiasts.
Yet there is consensus on one deep truth: nothing much will change.
After a week of televised, heart-wrenching funerals, American life will go on until the next massacre.
Mass violence is deeply rooted in American culture.
America’s European settlers committed a two-century-long genocide against the native inhabitants, and established a slave economy so deeply entrenched that only a devastating civil war ended it.
In almost all other countries, even Czarist Russia, slavery and serfdom were ended by decree or legislation, without a four-year bloodletting.
When it was over, America established and enforced a century-long system of apartheid.
To this day, America’s homicide and imprisonment rates are several times higher than Europe’s.
Several large mass shootings occur each year – in a country that is also waging several seemingly endless wars overseas.
America is, in short, a country with a past history and current stark reality of racism, ethnic chauvinism, and resort to mass violence.
The Las Vegas shootings make clear once more the need to ban assault weapons.
When America had such a ban, from September 1994-September 2004, it helped to limit mass shootings; yet Congress failed to renew the ban, owing to intense lobbying from gun enthusiasts.
Nor is the ban about to be reinstated any time soon at the federal level.
A prohibition against “bump stocks,” the device used by the Las Vegas killer to enable his semi-automatic rifles to fire like fully automatic weapons, appears possible; but there will be little more federal action than that.
When Australia banned assault weapons in 1996, mass shootings stopped abruptly.
America’s gun lovers reject such evidence, and mass shootings like the one in Las Vegas serve only to reinforce their belief that firearms are their only true protection in a dangerous world.
According to compelling recent survey data, the attachment to guns is especially intense among less-educated white Republican men residing mainly in rural and suburban areas in the South and Midwest – the same demographic that forms the core of support for President Donald Trump.
Despite the deep ideological divisions in the country, there is a glimmer of hope.
Under the US Constitution, states have the authority to ban assault weapons and regulate firearms (though not to ban handguns and rifles outright, given the Supreme Court’s interpretation of the Second Amendment’s “right to bear arms”).
My own state, New York, already bans assault weapons, as do a handful of other states.
Rather than fighting another ill-fated battle in Washington, it is more promising to encourage many more states to exercise their prerogatives.
States that do will have lower rates of mass shootings, more secure citizens, and more vibrant economies.
Las Vegas will suffer not only from the trauma of the recent massacre, but also from a diversion of tourism and conferences, at least until Nevada cracks down on assault weapons and can guarantee visitors’ safety.
America today doesn’t just have red (conservative) states and blue (progressive) states, but de facto red countries and blue countries, that is, distinct regions with distinct cultures, heroes, politics, dialects, economies, and ideas of freedom.
In New York City, freedom means not having to fear that the thousands of strangers sharing the city’s sidewalks and parks with you on any given day are carrying deadly weapons.
In Texas or Las Vegas, freedom is the comfort of carrying your trusty firearms anywhere you like.
It’s time to let red states and blue states go their own way.
We don’t need to fight another civil war to agree on an amicable and limited move to much looser linkages across the states.
In this, the conservatives have it right: Let’s reduce the power of the federal government and turn more revenues and regulations back to the states, subject to the constitutional limits on the division of powers and fundamental rights.
That way, each side of the culture wars can move closer to its preferred outcomes without impeding the other side from doing the same.
My own state would thrive in such a looser federation, using its increased margin of maneuver to tighten its own regulations and to scale up its social services with the savings in taxes now paid to the federal government.
And the weaker federal government would mean fewer US “wars of choice” in the Middle East.
At some point, the US will end up with federal gun control legislation.
When more Congressmen come to realize that their own lives are on the line – which, sadly, they are – we will finally see national action.
Two members of Congress have already been shot this decade (Gabrielle Giffords in 2011 and Steve Scalise earlier this year).
For now, however, members of Congress will remain caught in the political crossfire of mad gunmen and pro-gun lobbyists.
This is terrifying, but sadly the case.
In Trump’s America, gun violence and instability are being stoked daily.
A rapidly implemented, national-scale solution would be ideal.
But until that happens, more US states should be encouraged to choose gun sanity for themselves.
Patenting Immaculate Conception?
HAARLEM – In 1899, the German-American scientist Jacques Loeb engineered the asexual reproduction of sea urchins through artificial parthenogenesis (the manipulation of egg cells to enable embryonic development without fertilization).
His speculation about complete parthenogenesis in mammals – not to mention his use of the term “immaculate conception” to describe the process – prompted public concern about whether scientists should be “playing God.”
With the International Stem Cell Corporation (ISCC) seeking patents in Europe for a technology that produces stem cell lines from the parthenogenetic activation of an unfertilized ovum, the time has come to answer that question.
The question is how.
Problems with the patenting of parthenogenetically activated cells are nothing new.
Such cells resemble human embryos, which, under European Union patent law, cannot be patented.
Following a ruling by the European Court of Justice (ECJ) in 2011 that those cells constitute human embryos, patent applications for parthenogenetic cells in the United Kingdom and other countries have been delayed and even rejected.
(The ISCC does hold patents for its stem cells in the United States.)
But on December 18, 2014, the ECJ reversed its 2011 ruling, determining that an unfertilized human ovum stimulated by parthenogenesis “does not constitute a human embryo, if it does not in itself have the inherent capacity of developing into a human being.”
The ECJ based its ruling on written (unpublished) observations submitted by EU member states.
The UK High Court then remitted the application to the UK Intellectual Property Office, which granted the patent in October.
The ECJ did not rule explicitly that parthenogenesis of human ova is patentable.
It did not examine whether parthenogenesis constituted “a process for the cloning of a human being,” which would not be patentable under EU law.
And it did not consider whether the activated egg cell – a “parthenote” – counts as a germ cell, which also cannot be patented in the EU (though it did pose the question to the applicants at the hearing).
The national court and the patent office did not, as far as we can establish from their websites, examine these exclusions from patentability either.
Nor did they consider that parthenotes develop until the blastocyst embryonic stage, harboring the capacity for full attachment.
But even if the ISCC’s patent applications are not excluded on these grounds, there is another potential roadblock for applicants: Under European law, an invention can be patented only if its commercial exploitation is deemed not to controvert “ordre public” or morality.
As Loeb pointed out more than 100 years ago, when it comes to inventions involving bodily materials and biological processes, moral questions are difficult to answer.
They should not, it now seems clear, be left to the patent office or even the courts.
In fact, the European Patent Office (EPO) is not particularly committed to assessing the moral implications of the patents it grants; in its view, “ordre public” would be violated only in the extreme case of a truly outrageous invention.
As a result, while the application procedure allows for third parties to submit to the patent office their observations on the claimed invention’s patentability, it is unlikely to spur a genuine assessment of an application’s moral implications.
An opposing third party would have to shoulder the entire burden of proof, while the patent office avoided taking any real action, in order to avoid “presumptuous” interference in the public debate.
As for the courts, the recent case highlighted the absence of a procedural mechanism to ensure consideration of a patent’s morality.
So who should answer questions about an invention’s implications for “ordre public”?
The answer is straightforward: the public itself.
Inclusive, transparent, and effective public debate about these potentially consequential issues demands, first and foremost, that citizens are well informed.
After all, when it comes to technological advances relating to biological materials and processes, this is only the beginning.
On December 24, 2014, just six days after the ECJ’s ruling, scientists published the results of their efforts to make rudimentary egg and sperm cells starting from a person’s skin cells.
There are also pending patent applications for a novel form of genetic manipulation – CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing – which a team of Chinese researchers has already attempted to use to edit the genome of a human embryo.
Notably, under the ECJ’s “inherent capacity” definition, the embryos used in that experiment would not constitute a human embryo, and thus would not be excluded from patentability.
As the International Summit on Human Gene Editing recently stated, it would be irresponsible to proceed with a clinical use of germline editing without broad societal agreement.
The same should go for patenting it.
If, based on an understanding of the processes and their implications, a majority of a country’s citizens find them to controvert morality, democratic principles would demand a government response.
In line with the EU’s 1998 biotech directive, debates should occur on a country-by-country basis.
Already, European states have made conflicting decisions on these topics.
In Switzerland, a substantial majority of voters decided in 2004 to ratify the Stem Cell Research Act, which regulates how human embryonic stem cells are produced and used in research.
Swiss stem-cell law is now more restrictive than that of, say, the UK, but less restrictive than that of Germany.
Specifically, Swiss law prohibits the development of parthenotes, the derivation of stem cells from parthenotes, and the use of such stem cells.
It also excludes from patentability processes for parthenogenesis using human germ cells, as well as parthenotes created by such processes.
These prohibitions are based not just on the need to protect human embryos, but also on concerns relating to the availability of donated egg cells, on which parthenogenesis depends – an issue that neither the courts nor the patent office have considered.
A country-by-country, public-driven approach to assessing the morality of inventions involving biological materials and processes would reinforce both EU law and democratic principles.
As recent rulings have made clear, the current system is far from adequate when it comes to upholding ordre public.
Preventing the Next African Famine
NEW YORK – After falling for more than a decade, the number of hungry people in the world is rising once again.
This year was marked by the worst global food crisis since World War II, with South Sudan, Yemen, Somalia, and Nigeria either experiencing famine or teetering on the brink.
More than 20 million people in those four countries alone remain severely food-insecure, and the United Nations estimates that $1.8 billion in immediate humanitarian aid is needed.
Political instability and conflict have contributed heavily to this food insecurity, but insufficient food production has also likely heightened tensions and exacerbated hunger.
In Sub-Saharan Africa, where three of the four countries on the verge of famine are located, crop yields have long lagged behind the rest of the world, owing to poor farm inputs, such as low-quality seeds and fertilizer.
Investing in agriculture is one of the most effective ways to end hunger and improve political stability.
There are 50 million smallholder farmers in Sub-Saharan Africa alone, and they support many millions more.
Countries on the continent that have invested heavily in agricultural development and smallholder farmers have been successful at avoiding famine.
Consider the example of Ethiopia, which experienced one of the worst famines in history in the mid-1980s.
An estimated one million people died during that crisis, which was caused by a combination of conflict and drought, and it took many years for the country to recover.
Today, Ethiopia is peaceful, but drought conditions have returned.
In 2016, the country suffered its driest growing season in 50 years.
And yet Ethiopia did not experience famine last year.
There were hungry people, to be sure, but disaster was avoided.
Oxfam attributes this to the fact that the government was better prepared to deliver food and water to millions.
The country has also vastly improved its farming infrastructure, and new irrigation and drinking water systems provide rural areas with easy access to clean, safe water sources.
For more than a decade, the Ethiopian government has made agricultural development a top priority.
In 2010, it created the Ethiopian Agricultural Transformation Agency, a public entity dedicated to boosting the productivity of the agriculture sector.
As the noted British author and Africa researcher Alex de Waal has noted, “Politics creates famine, and politics can stop it.”
Ethiopia proves his point.
While domestic and international contributions still flow during relief efforts, it is Ethiopia’s long-term investments that have increased the country’s resilience.
An increase in strategic agricultural investments, from African donors or international sources, could help other countries in the region reap similar rewards.
Climate change is making such investments even more urgent, as extreme weather events – both flooding and droughts – are becoming more common throughout Sub-Saharan Africa.
Even without government support, however, farmers can take modest and cost-effective steps immediately to mitigate climate shocks.
By using smart farming techniques such as drought-resistant seeds, intercropping, composting, and crop diversification, farmers can blunt the effects of extreme weather at very low costs.
Trees are one of the most effective tools we have for fighting climate change, and they also make economic sense for small farmers.
A farmer who invests $2 in seedlings can make a profit of more than $80 in ten years, when some of the full-grown trees can be cut and sold.
Trees also benefit the environment while they are growing – by absorbing carbon, improving soil health, and preventing erosion.
Farmers who have an asset base of trees, livestock, or cash generated by selling crop surpluses are better able to withstand weather shocks.
And, as our organization is currently demonstrating in six African countries, farmers can build their asset bases with training and financial support.
That is why we believe African governments and bilateral donors should deepen their investments in programs that provide farmers with the skills to produce long-term crops, especially trees, sustainably.
Inexpensive practices – such as planting crops in rows, weeding correctly, and applying fertilizer in micro-doses – are also proven methods to increase crop production dramatically.
With the effects of climate change expected to intensify in coming years, Africa’s smallholder farmers must prepare now for a more turbulent future.
The United States has historically been the world’s largest donor to global food security programs, but the future of this leadership role under President Donald Trump is uncertain.
While global food security initiatives enjoy bipartisan support in the US Congress, the Trump administration’s proposed foreign aid budget recommends deep funding cuts to these programs.
As US support waivers, African and European governments, foundations, institutional donors, and practitioners must be ready to step in to help African farmers build long-term resiliency.
Investing in agriculture is the most efficient way to improve food security in Africa, while ensuring that people on the front lines of the fight against climate change can maintain thriving economies and sustainable, healthy environments.
Only through careful planning, and by following the lead of countries like Ethiopia, can Sub-Saharan Africa address the underlying causes of hunger.
Although food security is a complex problem to solve, preventing future famines doesn’t have to be.
The Mis-Measure of Development
BERMUDA – A new scorecard that purports to grade countries on development progress tells us little about how we are faring against humanity’s biggest challenges.
Instead, it highlights the shortcomings of today’s unfocused global development agenda.
The major new report, led by Jeffrey D. Sachs and issued by the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Solutions Network and Germany’s Bertelsmann Stiftung, provides a color-coded dashboard to demonstrate how well every country is doing at implementing the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) – the hugely important agenda that succeeded the highly effective Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) 18 months ago.
Green indicates success across all indicators of a goal; yellow, orange, and red point to increasing distances from achieving the goal.
You might expect to discover from the rating how well rich countries are allocating their development aid, and how successfully poorer countries are spending their own funds, to make sure more people have access to education, healthcare, food security, and a safe, clean environment – the planet’s fundamental development challenges.
Instead, the index shows us that Cambodia – where more than 20% of the population lives on less than $1.90 per day – gets a green, outperforming an orange Spain on implementation of SDG 1: “End poverty in all its forms everywhere.”
On government efficiency, the report claims that Italy is doing worse than all countries except Venezuela – much worse than Burundi or even Syria – in a ranking topped by Singapore and, more surprisingly, Rwanda.
The United States scores a surprising number of reds and yellows, ranking 42nd out of 157 countries overall.
In fact, the US fails to achieve a single green ranking for any of the 17 SDGs, sharing this dubious honor with only Greece, Italy, Latvia, Mexico, Spain, and Turkey, among OECD nations.
(War-torn Yemen, by contrast, scores green for both “Climate Action” and “Partnership for the Goals”.)
America-bashing is popular and easy.
But US taxpayers do give nearly a quarter of all the money spent on direct development aid by rich countries.
A report that gives the world’s biggest donor the lowest possible rating for “Partnerships for the Goals” would seem to have some underlying issues.
(Myanmar, Uzbekistan, and Saudi Arabia all score green marks in this category.)
A larger problem is behind the report’s oddities: today’s development agenda is trying to be all things to all people.
The MDGs worked because they were few in number and sharply focused.
The SDGs comprise an eye-watering 169 targets, which means there is no focus at all.
The US gets a less-than-stellar yellow for SDG 3, which covers health and wellbeing.
Why?
Life expectancy in the US is relatively high, and neonatal and maternal mortality rates are relatively low.
It turns out that the overall US score is dragged down by the poor mark given for the country’s high number of traffic deaths.
But conflating car accidents in Ohio with neonatal mortality rates and HIV prevalence merely muddies the global development agenda.
And Australia gets a red on the “End Hunger” SDG, not because of significant starvation or micronutrient deficiency, but because its obesity rates are too high and its extensive agriculture has lower yields.
Obesity and agricultural efficiency in rich countries are certainly important.
But in the attempt to make sure both developing and developed countries have problems to solve, we’re losing sight of what really matters: Some 795 million people in the world do not have enough food to lead a healthy, active life.
That’s about one of every nine people on Earth.
The vast majority live in developing countries, where 12.9% of the population is undernourished.
Solving micronutrient deficiencies was one of 19 specific targets identified by a panel of Nobel laureate economists who studied the SDG targets for the Copenhagen Consensus, the think tank I direct, and identified the most cost-effective ways to help people, protect the planet, and boost prosperity.
Targets such as achieving universal access to contraception and family planning, ending tuberculosis by 2030, freer global trade, ending fossil-fuel subsidies, and protecting coral reefs would help the environment and improve billions of lives.
Analysis showed that focusing on the panel’s top 19 targets would achieve about four times more in terms of welfare gains than would trying to distribute funds among all 169 targets.
Instead, governments are laboring with the sheer number of SDGs.
As the SDG Index admits, “countries appear to struggle with implementing the full range” of indicators.
Countries themselves are now doing the prioritization that the UN failed to do.
They cannot possibly achieve all 169 targets at once, so they focus on only some of them.
The real danger is that their selection will not be those targets that could do the most good per dollar, pound, rupee or peso spent, but those that have the most media appeal, NGO attention, or corporate interest.
We need to strip back the development agenda to its core issues, and focus on those areas where each dollar spent can achieve the most for humanity.
Only by doing so can a scorecard help us maximize development progress.
A Wary Return to Raqqa
BERLIN – In mid-October, the Syrian Democratic Forces, a US-backed, predominantly Kurdish militia with ties to the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) in Turkey, “liberated” my hometown, Raqqa, from Islamic State (ISIS) fighters.
Arabs, a majority of the region’s population, had little to do with ISIS’s ouster.
In a city where locals have long been relegated to second-class status, the triumph of the Democratic Union Party (PYD) – the Syrian branch of the PKK – has kindled fears that history is repeating.
Activists from Raqqa have long referred to our dilapidated city as an “internal colony,” owing to its long history of economic, political, and social marginalization at the hands of Syrian governments.
In the early 1970s, Raqqa – then small and poor – was nonetheless moving forward and flourishing.
Schools were multiplying as attendance surged.
Other public services were improving as well, and parents believed that their children would lead more prosperous lives than they and previous generations had.
This was certainly true of my parents, who sacrificed a lot to raise their nine children.
They were not happy when, in the 1970s, their older sons became communists, strongly opposing the brutal regime of Hafez al-Assad, President Bashar al-Assad’s father.
But this was not a farfetched transformation in a city where people were assuming new identities – such as Nasserist, Baathist, Islamist, or communist – downplaying their regional and tribal origins.
But by the time I was arrested in 1980, as a university student in Aleppo, the future my parents once envisioned had begun to vanish.
Five years later, another son was arrested, followed by a third six months after that.
Our mother died of cancer while the three of us were in prison, hardly exceptional for Syrians at the time.
We were among many from across the political and ideological spectrum who were arrested and tortured for daring to oppose the Assad regime.
Syrians suffered from extreme repression, with people denied the right to assemble or even to discuss issues publicly, and the country was reduced to a political desert.
I didn’t get out of jail until 1996, when I was 35.
Returning to Raqqa then, after 16 years behind bars, I was struck by what Assad’s regime – 26 years in power at that time – had done to my city.
There was no trace of political life, no public debate, no young people talking about the books they were reading or the films they were watching.
Before my arrest, Raqqa had three cinemas.
By the time I was released, there was only one, used mostly for weddings.
The cult of Hafez had, by then, replaced Syrians’ free will.
The elder Assad’s images were ubiquitous; among the first landmarks to greet me upon my release was a huge statue of the president.
The walls were covered in vapid quotations from the hollow speeches of “the master of the nation.”
Raqqa was in rapid decline by then, and the city’s despair would intensify over the next decade.
By 2007, even Abdullah Dardari, the deputy prime minister for economic affairs and a chief architect of Syria’s economic reforms (which were upended by the 2011 civil war), described Raqqa as a long-forgotten city.
The arrival of ISIS only hastened the colonization of my ephemeral metropolis.
Sadly, even with ISIS gone, the sense of siege remains.
Western forces and their proxy, the PYD militia, whose real loyalty is to their leaders in Turkey, now control Raqqa.
One of the first things that our new PYD liberators/occupiers did after declaring victory was to display their own foreign identity by installing a huge portrait of the PKK’s jailed leader, Abdullah Ocalan.
Not a single Syrian symbol was offered in tandem.
Worse, after a military operation that destroyed 90% of the city and killed some 1,800 residents, the city’s new rulers have not even begun to remove the bodies buried beneath the rubble.
Instead, long-time residents have been prevented from returning to their homes.
For those of us with long memories, it is impossible not to draw comparisons with past rulers – the Assad regime and ISIS.
(The fascist organization that the Western media calls ISIS – a name that confers on it Islamic credentials – is more likely to be called Daesh in the Islamic world, a name coined by my brother Khaled, who was in jail with me in the 1980s.)
What is different this time is the seemingly inevitable march toward ethnic conflict.
The city’s previous victims are its latest victims as well.
The exploited, impoverished, underrepresented, despised, and dehumanized population is living under even worse conditions, more marginalized than ever.
The locals are being dealt with as tribes, according to the modern colonial model.
Raqqa’s “liberation” is not ours.
The population is more estranged than ever.
Our past struggles for freedom and justice are being ignored.
The locals who fought against ISIS, and who were made to disappear at its hands (including my brother Feras, abducted in July 2013), are still missing.
And ISIS has served as the ideal monster for many colonial occupiers eager to appear less villainous than they are.
Tackling Non-Inclusive Growth
MILAN – Several years ago, I had the privilege of chairing a commission on growth in developing countries.
Its members had significant economic, political, and social policymaking experience in the developing world, and despite their differences, they all agreed on certain crucial points.
Two still stand out in my memory.
First, as we concluded in our final report, non-inclusive growth patterns will always ultimately fail.
Such patterns cannot produce the sustained high growth that is necessary for reducing poverty and fulfilling basic human aspirations for health, security, and the chance to contribute productively and creatively to society.
They underutilize and misuse valuable human resources; and they often give rise to political or social turmoil, often marked by ideological or ethnic polarization, which then leads either to wide policy swings or to policy paralysis.
Our second broad conclusion was that sustained growth requires a coherent, adaptable strategy that is based on shared values and goals, trust, and some degree of consensus.
Of course, achieving that is easier said than done.
Many developing countries have experienced extended periods of slow or no growth.
In some cases, a country’s leaders are simply confused, and do not understand what needs to be done.
In most cases, however, the ingredients of an effective “growth model” are well known, and the problem is a lack of political or social consensus about how to implement it.
Achieving a higher growth equilibrium is rarely a gradual or incremental transition.
It requires a discontinuous leap in expectations and policies, and a fundamental shift in the political and social consensus.
When these shifts occur, leadership plays a crucial role, by providing citizens with an alternative vision, based on common values, that all stakeholders can support.
Such leadership can come from above, from below, or from a representative group.
But as the persistence of low-growth equilibria in many countries shows, it often doesn’t come at all.
The spillover effects of non-inclusive growth are already evident almost everywhere, to varying degrees, in the form of social polarization, policy gridlock and incoherence, and a generalized loss of public trust.
In this respect, developing countries’ experience holds potentially important lessons for policymakers and various stakeholders in advanced economies.
There has been some progress in identifying the factors causing economic inclusiveness to decline in the last three decades.
This is important: only by understanding the nature of the challenge can we develop more effective responses to it.
If we misdiagnose the problem with a flawed or rushed analysis, our response will be ineffective, and probably even counterproductive.
That said, the analyses conducted so far have not yet generated widespread awareness of the threat that non-inclusive growth poses to productivity and economic performance as conventionally measured.
The adverse economic effects of non-inclusive growth grow and multiply slowly over time, and will continue to do so in the absence of collective action – usually but not necessarily manifested through government – to shift prevailing distributional patterns.
Some would disagree with this proposition, because they believe that the factors behind economic performance and dynamism are independent of distributional patterns.
But I would remind them of the second lesson from developing countries’ experience: non-inclusive growth patterns undermine trust and eventually governance, in turn undercutting policymakers’ ability to sustain policies and strategies that support high growth.
To put it bluntly, insightful analysis has its uses, but change will not happen without a widespread social and political convergence around shared values and objectives – something that is sorely missing in many countries today.
People need to trust one another and their leaders, and they need to agree on how to assess and respond to polarizing economic and social trends.
At the same time, continued inaction will fuel alienation, creating a vicious circle of distrust and paralysis that will have to be broken before effective action can occur.
There are already many important initiatives dedicated to various dimensions of the inclusiveness challenge, which include not just income and wealth inequality, but also automation, artificial intelligence, and the future of work.
Despite their good intentions, it remains to be seen if any of these initiatives will pave the way for effective policy responses.
The value of insightful analyses of such complex problems should not be discounted.
But we cannot assume that getting the diagnosis right will be sufficient to overcome political gridlock.
The other key ingredient is direct engagement.
Restoring public trust will require a deep and sustained commitment, and a new consensus that is broad enough to overcome the political and social divides that are now legion across advanced economies.
From this perspective, the proliferation of commissions and other initiatives that are structured around inclusion, which might seem excessive and redundant under less polarized circumstances, is actually very encouraging.
Convening diverse voices from business, industry, labor, government, academia, and civil society – and doing so as frequently as possible – is exactly what is needed right now.
The engagement aspect of the inclusive-growth mission may seem a bit nebulous, especially next to concrete analysis.
Nevertheless, it is crucial.
Bringing together people who disagree or even distrust one another is the first step toward building a foundation for collective action in the future.
Big Polluters, Pay Up
JAKARTA – Earlier this year in Myanmar, torrential rain caused mudslides that wiped out hundreds of houses and caused large-scale crop destruction.
More than 1.3 million people were affected, and over 100 died.
In Vietnam, the same deluges caused toxic slurry pits from coal mines to overflow and run through villages, and into the World Heritage-listed Ha Long Bay; the death toll was 17.
As such weather events become increasingly frequent and intense, the need to mitigate and adapt to climate change is becoming more urgent than ever.
And make no mistake: These events are, at least partly, the result of climate change.
As the climate scientist Kevin Trenberth of the US National Center for Atmospheric Research points out, nowadays, “[a]ll weather events are affected by climate change, because the environment in which they occur is warmer and moister than it used to be.”
International climate negotiators recognize this, to some extent.
The effects faced by the people of Myanmar and Vietnam are considered unavoidable costs of failing to adapt to climate change, which officials classify as “loss and damage.”
But such language fails to capture the full scale of the consequences – especially their impact on human lives.
The people who died in Myanmar and Vietnam are not just “unavoidable costs,” and their loved ones cannot simply “adapt” to losing them.
This kind of bloodless rhetoric reflects the inadequacy of the responses to climate change that international negotiations have so far produced.
In fact, if the industrialized world had done what was needed to stop climate change, as promised a generation ago, Myanmar and Vietnam most likely would have been spared their recent “loss and damage.”
The so-called advanced economies failure to fulfill their commitments means that Myanmar and Vietnam are hardly the most vulnerable developing countries today.
The tiny island states of the Pacific, for example, have been unable to erect adequate defenses against the “king tides” that are encroaching on their land and causing the freshwater “lenses” beneath their atolls to become brackish.
Their populations – among the world’s poorest people – are paying for climate change with their lives and livelihoods.
And without the resources to adapt, they will continue to suffer.
But it gets even more perverse.
Those behind the problem – the world’s biggest polluters – continue to reap billions in profits, while receiving huge energy subsidies from governments (projected to reach $5.3 trillion in 2015, or about $10 million per minute).
So who are these polluters?
According to a 2013 study by the scientist Rick Heede, nearly two-thirds of carbon dioxide emitted since the 1750s can be traced to just 90 of the largest fossil fuel- and cement-producing entities, most of which still operate.
Fifty are investor-owned companies, including ChevronTexaco, ExxonMobil, Shell, BP, and Peabody Energy; 31 are state-owned companies, such as Saudi Aramco and Norway’s Statoil; and nine are states like Saudi Arabia and China.
Recognizing the blatant injustice – not to mention the destructiveness – of this state of affairs, a new initiative, launched by the Carbon Levy Project and supported by a growing number of individuals and organizations, has emerged to demand compensation for vulnerable developing countries from the big polluters.
Specifically, the Carbon Levy Project proposes a tax at the point of extraction for fossil fuels.
Such a tax is consistent with international law, including the “polluter pays” principle, and would provide a new and predictable source of finance – amounting to billions of dollars – for the communities that need it most, without letting governments off the hook for providing public sources of finance.
And, by raising the cost of extracting fossil fuels, it would contribute to the eventual phase-out of a sector that has no place in a climate-safe world.
Fortunately, the world will not have to wait for moral suasion to carry the day.
Fossil-fuel companies and governments are already facing intensifying legal pressure.
Typhoon survivors in the Philippines delivered a complaint to the country’s Commission on Human Rights, calling for an investigation into big fossil-fuel companies’ responsibility for causing climate change.
The Dutch group Urgenda and nearly 900 co-plaintiffs successfully sued the Dutch government, forcing it to adopt more stringent climate policies.
A Peruvian farmer now intends to sue the German coal company RWE to cover the costs of protecting his home, which lies in the flood path of a glacial lake.
And the signatories of the Peoples’ Declaration for Climate Justice from Pacific Island countries are committed to bringing a case against big polluters for activities resulting in the destruction of their homes.
If no action is taken, such lawsuits will only become more frequent and difficult to defeat.
Big Oil, Big Gas, and Big Coal need to accept responsibility for climate change and start making real contributions to adaptation, or prepare to battle for their own survival – a battle that, in the long term, they simply cannot win.
Big Tech Meets Big Government
SINGAPORE – Impressive quarterly results from the biggest technology companies show that they are nowhere near saturating their consumer markets, exhausting their innovation cycles, or reaching growth maturation.
Dig a little deeper, and those reports also illustrate the sector’s substantial and growing systemic importance.
Yet, for the tech sector, there is a distinct downside to this development.
With increased systemic importance often comes greater scrutiny.
And, indeed, today’s prosperous and innovative tech giants now face the prospect of redoubled efforts to regulate and tax their activities.
The longer it takes for these companies to recognize their systemic importance, the greater the likelihood of a more powerful backlash by governments and the public, hurting the companies and undermining their ability to continue producing innovations that genuinely boost consumers’ wellbeing.
When the tech sector began its evolution toward systemic importance, it comprised a collection of hungry start-ups possessing breakthrough technologies.
Beyond disrupting existing economic sectors and activities, these technologies ended up producing new demand for the altogether new goods and services that they enabled.
Tech companies’ track record – time and again proving their capacity for exceptional growth – enables them to attract massive investment.
They are thus able not only to strengthen their market position in their core activities, but also to develop innovative capabilities in new areas, by taking over smaller competitors, whether actual or prospective.
And some are even able to self-disrupt repeatedly – and thus consistently to remain at the technological frontier.
Fueling Big Tech’s remarkable growth further, many of these companies’ services are ostensibly free, facilitating quick adoption by consumers.
It helps that these services often can be provided as seamlessly abroad as they are within their country of origin, to the point that the very concept of “abroad” has become rather elastic.
Over time, the major tech companies’ rapid accumulation of market power has led to the rise of oligopolies in some sectors, and monopoly players in a few.
Their social, economic, and even political influence has soared in some cases.
Facebook and Twitter, for example, played a pivotal role in galvanizing protesters during the Arab Spring uprisings of 2011.
This raises serious risks: as beneficial as Big Tech’s innovations are, they can also serve as important channels for state or non-state actors to bring about their own disruptions.
In the run-up to last year’s presidential election in the United States, some social media platforms inadvertently enabled the spread of disinformation.
More menacing, extremists like the Islamic State have relied on social media for recruitment and propaganda purposes.
It should come as no surprise that Big Tech firms tend to move much faster than governments and regulators.
As such, what began as a laissez-faire attitude of benign neglect– largely a result of ignorance and inattention – is evolving into something more forceful.
As tech firms reach systemic importance, attitudes toward them change markedly.
This shift has become increasingly apparent in recent years, as major tech firms have faced intensifying scrutiny of their competitive practices, tax behavior, data uses, and privacy policies.
Broader questions about their contributions to labor displacement and effects on wage growth have also arisen, even as societies increasingly recognize that technological disruption implies the need for education reform and improvements in skills acquisition and retraining.
Yet the tech sector itself still seems to underestimate its growing systemic importance.
As a result, firms can lag in recognizing the need to update their operations, resources, and mindsets to reflect their shift from small disruptor to powerful incumbent.
That means building more comprehensive and integrated business models, informed by experienced talent with expertise in a broader array of areas, in order to move beyond these companies’ laser focus on innovation.
The longer this process takes, the greater the risk that tech firms will lose control of the narrative.
Beyond fueling a rise in outside monitoring, regulation, and supervision, there is the risk of a consumer backlash – or even the further exploitation of innovations by malicious actors.
In an ideal world, major tech companies would recognize and adjust to their changing role in step with external actors, including governments and consumers, thereby striking the right balance between innovation, consumer benefits and protection, and national security.
But this is not an ideal world.
And, so far, internal and external forces have been out of sync, in terms of perceptions, capabilities, and actions.
Add to that conscious and unconscious biases and considerable temptation for political manipulation, and the risks become only more profound.
Big Tech can and should play a larger role in helping the entire economy to evolve in an orderly and mutually beneficial manner.
This will require, first and foremost, that they internalize their own systemic importance, and adjust their perspectives and behaviors accordingly.
But it will also demand far better communication, with firms’ objectives and operations becoming much more transparent.
And, finally, it will call for a commitment to enhanced monitoring both of themselves and of their peers, together with more effective collective action, as appropriate.
If the tech sector fails to make such changes, government oversight and regulation will inevitably intensify.
And it is far from certain that the net result will be positive for society, much less for business.
Making the Future Work for Us
CAMBRIDGE – What does the future of work hold in store, and how should we prepare for it?
The debate so far has focused on developed countries, but it is a question that will affect the entire world.
To pessimists, the introduction of these so-called general-purpose technologies – including 3-D printing, artificial intelligence, and the Internet of Things – threatens the demand for labor; without new forms of social solidarity, such as a universal basic income, the future will be one of widespread destitution.
To optimists, the latest technological developments, like others that have propelled humanity forward, promise to deliver unprecedented levels of prosperity.
It is probably impossible at this stage to say which side is right.
As the physicist Niels Bohr said: “It is very hard to predict, especially the future.”
For a complex system such as the world economy, understanding the past – for example, the massive decline in manufacturing employment in almost all countries over the past two decades – is already hard enough.
What is more easily ascertained are the causal links that might determine the outcome.
Rapid displacement of massive amounts of human labor is not a new occurrence.
The early-nineteenth-century Luddites revolted against the mechanical looms that were supplanting artisanal textile production.
Almost 60 years later, agricultural employment in the US peaked at 53% of total employment.
Today, it is less than 3%.
In fact, since as recently as 1980, most countries have experienced large declines in agricultural employment.
In some, like Portugal, Malaysia, Turkey, and Indonesia, the share of agricultural employment declined by more than 20%.
In others, like Greece, Italy, Bulgaria, Hungary, Estonia, Poland, Philippines, and Sri Lanka, the decline exceeded 10%.
And it’s not just agriculture.
According to the World Bank’s World Development Indicators, the share of manufacturing in GDP fell in 100 of the 124 countries reporting data since 1990.
But if large shifts in the composition of employment have been the norm, what makes today’s technology-driven shifts so scary?
Fundamentally, technology is a way to transform “the world as I found it” into “the world as I want it to be” – from pastures to milk, from soybeans to chicken tenders, from silicon to smartphones.
And it depends on three forms of knowledge: embedded knowledge in tools; codified knowledge in recipes, manuals, and protocols; and tacit knowledge, or knowhow, in brains.
Most of the time, these three forms of knowledge complement one another: like coffee and sugar, the more of one you have, the more of the others you want.
But technological progress occasionally substitutes one for another, as with coffee and tea.
Once upon a time, people stuck their hands in the ground to plant the next crop.
Now seed drills and planters do that much more quickly and effortlessly.
Not long ago, airline check-in clerks wrote out boarding passes.
Now they are delivered to our smartphones.
It is these substitutions – the embodied knowledge of the machine for the knowhow of traditional handiwork – that make us fearful.
But while each new technology displaces one form of knowhow, it creates others.
The first industrial revolution so reduced the cost of textiles that it led to a boom in demand, production, and employment.
Likewise, as David Autor of MIT has pointed out, the automatic teller machine (ATM) displaced human bank tellers, but so reduced the cost of branches that their number rose, fueling an increase in employees focused on customer relationship management (for which ATMs are less than ideal).
Today, websites have displaced printed materials, giving rise to an industry of web designers.
But while it is clear which jobs new technologies displace, it is harder to anticipate how the new possibilities will be exploited.
Back in 2001, many thought the Internet’s fiber-optic backbone had been overbuilt, given low demand for bandwidth.
But then along came iTunes, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, Skype, and Netflix.
Similarly, today we are trying to predict the nature of future work before the jobs of the future have been invented.
The most important uncertain aspect of the new technologies is their diffusion capacity.
If they do not diffuse worldwide, they will widen the income divide between countries and regions.
Landline telephone service and electricity have diffused far less than guns and cellphones.
One determinant of a technology’s “diffusability” is its knowhow intensity.
Tools and codes are easy to ship; moving the knowhow needed to use them is a different matter.
Guns require just a little training to operate, whereas an electrical utility requires a large team of people with varied expertise to run the generators, install and service the transmission lines and sub-stations, limit theft, and compel customers to pay their bills on time.
Technologies that require more diverse knowhow, reflected in the size and heterogeneity of the team needed to implement them, diffuse much more slowly or not at all.
A new technology’s diffusion is also affected by its dependence on the previous diffusion of other technologies.
Uber depends on the previous diffusion of cell phones, cars, and credit cards.
If implementing a technology requires less knowhow and fewer other technologies, it is likely to diffuse even faster than the technologies it replaces.
This is what people call technological leapfrogging.
As was the case with computer-aided design and manufacturing, it is easier to run a 3-D printer than to master all the steps needed to make the same part the traditional way.
Artificial intelligence may make technology less reliant on knowhow and consequently easier to diffuse.
By contrast, the Internet of Things will probably require prior diffusion of many other technologies.
In 66 countries, electricity penetration is less than 60%; in 26 countries, it is less than 30%.
Finally, diffusion depends on whether countries can afford to purchase the new technology.
And that, in turn, depends on whether it facilitates or complicates their search for goods and services that they can sell internationally.
The globalization of value chains has made it easier for more countries and regions to participate in international trade, because each country needs to assemble less complex teams; but it has been bad for places like Detroit, where fully integrated industries used to cluster.
In the end, predicting the future is beside the point.
Most countries’ future is more likely to be bright if they focus on ensuring that they can master every new technology and exploit every new opportunity that comes their way.
Robotization Without Taxation?
NEW HAVEN – The idea of a tax on robots was raised last May in a draft report to the European Parliament prepared by MEP Mady Delvaux from the Committee on Legal Affairs.
Emphasizing how robots could boost inequality, the report proposed that there might be a “need to introduce corporate reporting requirements on the extent and proportion of the contribution of robotics and AI to the economic results of a company for the purpose of taxation and social security contributions.”
The public reaction to Delvaux’s proposal has been overwhelmingly negative, with the notable exception of Bill Gates, who endorsed it.
But we should not dismiss the idea out of hand.
In just the past year, we have seen the proliferation of devices such as Google Home and Amazon Echo Dot (Alexa), which replace some aspects of household help.
Likewise, the Delphi and nuTonomy driverless taxi services in Singapore have started to replace taxi drivers.
And Doordash, which uses Starship Technologies miniature self-driving vehicles, is replacing restaurant delivery people.
If these and other labor-displacing innovations succeed, surely calls to tax them will grow more frequent, owing to the human problems that arise when people lose their jobs – often jobs with which they closely identify, and for which they may have spent years preparing.
Optimists point out that there have always been new jobs for people replaced by technology; but, as the robot revolution accelerates, doubts about how well this will work out continue to grow.
A tax on robots, its advocates hope, might slow down the process, at least temporarily, and provide revenues to finance adjustment, like retraining programs for displaced workers.
Such programs may be as essential as our work is to healthy human life as we know it.
In his book Rewarding Work, Edmund S. Phelps emphasized the fundamental importance of maintaining a “place in society – a calling.”
When many people are no longer able to find work to support a family, troubling consequences ensue, and, as Phelps stresses, “the functioning of the entire community may be impaired.”
In other words, there are externalities to robotization that justify some government intervention.
Critics of a robot tax have emphasized that the ambiguity of the term “robot” makes defining the tax base difficult.
The critics also stress the new robotics’ enormous, undeniable benefits to productivity growth.
But let’s not rule out so quickly at least modest robot taxes during the transition to a different world of work. Such a tax should be part of a broader plan to manage the consequences of the robotics revolution.
All taxes, except a “lump-sum tax,” introduce distortions in the economy.
But no government can impose a lump-sum tax – the same amount for everyone regardless of their income or expenditures – because it would fall heaviest on those with less income, and it would grind the poor, who might be unable to pay it at all.
So taxes have to be related to some activity indicative of ability to pay taxes, and whatever activity it is will be discouraged as a result.
Frank Ramsey published a classic paper in 1927 arguing that to minimize taxation-induced distortions, one should tax all activities, and he proposed how to set tax rates.
His abstract theory has never been a fully operational principle for actual tax rates, but it provides a powerful argument against presuming that the tax should be zero for all but a few activities, or that all activities should be taxed at the same rate.
Activities that create externalities might have a higher tax rate than Ramsey would have proposed.
For example, taxes on alcoholic beverages are widespread. Alcoholism is a major social problem.
It destroys marriages, families, and lives. From 1920 to 1933, the United States tried a much harsher market intervention: outright prohibition of alcoholic beverages.
But it turned out to be impossible to eliminate alcohol consumption.
The alcohol tax that accompanied the end of Prohibition was a milder form of discouragement.
Discussion of a robot tax should consider what alternative we have to deal with rising inequality.
It would be natural to consider a more progressive income tax and a “basic income.” But, these measures do not have widespread popular support.
If support is not widespread, the tax, even if imposed, will not last.
When taxes on high incomes are raised, usually in wartime, it turns out to be only temporary.
Ultimately, it seems natural to most people that taxing successful people to benefit unsuccessful people is demeaning to the latter, and even the recipients of the handout often do not really want it.
Politicians know that: they usually do not campaign on proposals to confiscate high incomes and pad low incomes.
So, taxes must be reframed to remedy income inequality induced by robotization.
It may be more politically acceptable, and thus sustainable, to tax the robots rather than just the high-income people.
And while this would not tax individual human success, as income taxes do, it might in fact imply somewhat higher taxes on higher incomes, if high incomes are earned in activities that involve replacing humans with robots.
A moderate tax on robots, even a temporary tax that merely slows the adoption of disruptive technology, seems a natural component of a policy to address rising inequality.
Revenue could be targeted toward wage insurance, to help people replaced by new technology make the transition to a different career.
This would accord with our natural sense of justice, and thus be likely to endure.
Complacency Will Be Tested in 2018
NEW HAVEN – After years of post-crisis despair, the broad consensus of forecasters is now quite upbeat about prospects for the global economy in 2018.
World GDP growth is viewed as increasingly strong, synchronous, and inflation-free.
Exuberant financial markets could hardly ask for more.
While I have great respect for the forecasting community and the collective wisdom of financial markets, I suspect that today’s consensus of complacency will be seriously tested in 2018.
The test might come from a shock – especially in view of the rising risk of a hot war (with North Korea) or a trade war (between the US and China) or a collapsing asset bubble (think Bitcoin).
But I have a hunch it will turn out to be something far more systemic.
The world is set up for the unwinding of three mega-trends: unconventional monetary policy, the real economy’s dependence on assets, and a potentially destabilizing global saving arbitrage.
At risk are the very fundamentals that underpin current optimism. One or more of these pillars of complacency will, I suspect, crumble in 2018.
Unfortunately, the die has long been cast for this moment of reckoning.
Afflicted by a profound sense of amnesia, central banks have repeated the same mistake they made in the pre-crisis froth of 2003-2007 – over staying excessively accommodative monetary policies.
Misguided by inflation targeting in an inflationless world, monetary authorities have deferred policy normalization for far too long.
That now appears to be changing, but only grudgingly.
If anything, central bankers are signaling that the coming normalization may even be more glacial than that of the mid-2000s.
After all, with inflation still undershooting, goes the argument, what’s the rush?
Alas, there is an important twist today that wasn’t in play back then –central banks’ swollen balance sheets.
From 2008 to 2017, the combined asset holdings of central banks in the major advanced economies (the United States, the eurozone, and Japan) expanded by $8.3 trillion, according to the Bank for International Settlements.
With nominal GDP in these same economies increasing by just $2.1 trillion over the same period, the remaining $6.2 trillion of excess liquidity has distorted asset prices around the world.
Therein lies the crux of the problem.
Real economies have been artificially propped up by these distorted asset prices, and glacial normalization will only prolong this dependency.
Yet when central banks’ balance sheets finally start to shrink, asset-dependent economies will once again be in peril.
And the risks are likely to be far more serious today than a decade ago, owing not only to the overhang of swollen central bank balance sheets, but also to the overvaluation of assets.
That is particularly true in the United States.
According to Nobel laureate economist Robert J. Shiller, the cyclically adjusted price-earnings (CAPE) ratio of 31.3 is currently about 15% higher than it was in mid-2007, on the brink of the subprime crisis.
In fact, the CAPE ratio has been higher than it is today only twice in its 135-plus year history – in 1929 and in 2000. Those are not comforting precedents.
As was evident in both 2000 and 2008, it doesn’t take much for overvalued asset markets to fall sharply.
That’s where the third mega-trend could come into play – a wrenching adjustment in the global saving mix.
In this case, it’s all about China and the US – the polar extremes of the world’s saving distribution.
China is now in a mode of saving absorption; its domestic saving rate has declined from a peak of 52% in 2010 to 46% in 2016, and appears headed to 42%, or lower, over the next five years.
Chinese surplus saving is increasingly being directed inward to support emerging middle-class consumers – making less available to fund needy deficit savers elsewhere in the world.
By contrast, the US, the world’s neediest deficit country, with a domestic saving rate of just 17%, is opting for a fiscal stimulus.
That will push total national saving even lower – notwithstanding the vacuous self-funding assurances of supply-siders.
As shock absorbers, overvalued financial markets are likely to be squeezed by the arbitrage between the world’s largest surplus and deficit savers. And asset-dependent real economies won’t be too far behind.
In this context, it’s important to stress that the world economy may not be nearly as resilient as the consensus seems to believe – raising questions about whether it can withstand the challenges coming in 2018.
IMF forecasts are typically a good proxy for the global consensus.
The latest IMF projection looks encouraging on the surface – anticipating 3.7% global GDP growth over the 2017-18 period, an acceleration of 0.4 percentage points from the anemic 3.3% pace of the past two years.
However, it is a stretch to call this a vigorous global growth outcome.
Not only is it little different from the post-1965 trend of 3.8% growth, but the expected gains over 2017-2018 follow an exceptionally weak recovery in the aftermath of the Great Recession.
This takes on added significance for a global economy that slowed to just 1.4% average growth in 2008-2009 – an unprecedented shortfall from its longer-term trend.
The absence of a classic vigorous rebound means the global economy never recouped the growth lost in the worst downturn of modern times.
Historically, such V-shaped recoveries have served the useful purpose of absorbing excess slack and providing a cushion to withstand the inevitable shocks that always seem to buffet the global economy.
The absence of such a cushion highlights lingering vulnerability, rather than signaling newfound resilience – not exactly the rosy scenario embraced by today’s smug consensus.
A quote often attributed to the Nobel laureate physicist Niels Bohr says it best: “Prediction is very difficult, especially if it’s about the future.”
The outlook for 2018 is far from certain. But with tectonic shifts looming in the global macroeconomic landscape, this is no time for complacency.
The $200 Trillion Question
Perhaps the most remarkable trend in global macroeconomics over the past two decades has been the stunning drop in the volatility of economic growth.
In the United States, for example, quarterly output volatility has fallen by more than half since the mid-1980’s.
Obviously, moderation in output movements did not occur everywhere simultaneously.
Volatility in Asia began to fall only after the financial crisis of the late 1990’s.
In Japan and Latin America, volatility dropped in a meaningful way only in the current decade.
But by now, the decline has become nearly universal, with huge implications for global asset markets.
Indeed, the main question for 2007 is whether macroeconomic volatility will continue to decline, fueling another spectacular year for markets and housing, or start to rise again, perhaps due to growing geopolitical tensions.
I lean slightly toward the optimistic scenario, but investors and policymakers alike need to understand the ramifications of a return to more normal volatility levels.
Investors, especially, need to recognize that even if broader positive trends in globalization and technological progress continue, a rise in macroeconomic volatility could still produce a massive fall in asset prices.
Indeed, the massive equity and housing price increases of the past dozen or so years probably owe as much to greater macroeconomic stability as to any other factor.
As output and consumption become more stable, investors do not demand as large a risk premium.
The lower the price of risk, the higher the price of risky assets.
Consider this.
If you agree with the many pundits who say stock prices have gone too high, and are much more likely to fall than to rise further, you may be right—but not if macroeconomic risk continues to drain from the system.
At the end of 2000, at the height of the Internet stock boom and just before the 2001 crash, the economists James Glassman and Kevin Hassett published Dow 36,000 .
At the time, the Dow Jones industrial average of US stocks was trading at around 11,000, so the book’s premise seemed outrageous.
Certainly the timing was bad: global stock prices began to collapse a few months later, and it took years for them to fully recover.
But Glassman and Hassett did have a point.
Their admittedly crude analysis shows why, if volatility continues to fall in 2007, prices of stocks and other assets can still go a lot higher.
They asked how investors would price stocks if they expected historical average returns to continue, while also deciding that the risk was essentially zero.
That may sound extreme, but some scholars, such as the 2004 Nobel Prize winner Ed Prescott, have shown that, historically, holding a large diversified portfolio of stocks long enough is generally a far better investment than ultra-safe US Treasury bonds.
A back-of-the-envelope calculation shows that with the risk premium removed, stocks prices could easily triple from existing levels, with price/dividend ratios soaring to over 200, compared to historical averages of 40 to 50.
Of course, there is a big hole in the Dow 36,000 logic.
Stocks are risky, depressions can happen, and it is dangerous to extrapolate the past to the future.
If prices rise simply because investors decide that there is no longer any risk, then prices will collapse all the more precipitously if investors collectively change their minds.
This brings us to the $200 trillion question (roughly the value of global money and asset markets, including housing): What could cause macroeconomic volatility to start rising?
Don’t look to central banks; most are likely to manage the near-term risks to inflation and growth reasonably well.
Hedge funds could throw a scare.
The Germans tried to use their leadership in the G8 to achieve greater transparency in hedge funds, but they were beaten back by the US and Great Britain.
To my mind, though, the greatest risk is geopolitical instability.
By and large, China has been a far more constructive counterpart to the US than the former Soviet Union ever was.
But, given huge income disparities. China’s leaders still face enormous challenges in maintaining domestic stability, and continuing quiescence cannot be taken for granted.
At the same time, there are at least a half-dozen other global hot spots – some might be tempted to include the US Senate – that could trigger a major breakdown in world trade.
In short, if the macroeconomic moderation that dominated 2006 continues into 2007, look for further asset price inflation (but don’t hold your breath for the Dow to hit 36,000).
But if a major flare-up causes investors to lose confidence in low volatility, the bottom could fall out from under equity and housing prices.
In that case, do investors and policymakers have a plan B?
India’s Patently Wise Decision
NEW YORK – The Indian Supreme Court’s refusal to uphold the patent on Gleevec, the blockbuster cancer drug developed by the Swiss pharmaceutical giant Novartis, is good news for many of those in India suffering from cancer.
If other developing countries follow India’s example, it will be good news elsewhere, too: more money could be devoted to other needs, whether fighting AIDS, providing education, or making investments that enable growth and poverty reduction.
But the Indian decision also means less money for the big multinational pharmaceutical companies.
Not surprisingly, this has led to an overwrought response from them and their lobbyists: the ruling, they allege, destroys the incentive to innovate, and thus will deal a serious blow to public health globally.
These claims are wildly overstated.
In both economic and social-policy terms, the Indian court’s decision makes good sense.
Moreover, it is only a localized effort at rebalancing a global intellectual-property (IP) regime that is tilted heavily toward pharmaceutical interests at the expense of social welfare.
Indeed, there is a growing consensus among economists that the current IP regime actually stifles innovation.
The impact of strong IP protection on social welfare has long been considered ambiguous.
The promise of monopoly rights can spur innovation (though the most important discoveries, like that of DNA, typically occur within universities and government-sponsored research labs, and depend on other incentives).
But there often are serious costs as well: higher prices for consumers, the dampening effect on further innovation of reducing access to knowledge, and, in the case of life-saving drugs, death for all who are unable to afford the innovation that could have saved them.
The weight given to each of these factors depends on circumstances and priorities, and should vary by country and time.
Advanced industrialized countries in earlier stages of their development benefited from faster economic growth and greater social welfare by explicitly adopting weaker IP protection than is demanded of developing countries today.
Even in the United States, there is growing concern that so-called hold-up patents and me-too patents – and the sheer thicket of patents, in which any innovation is likely to become entangled in someone else’s IP claims – are diverting scarce research resources away from their most productive uses.
India represents only about 1-2% of the global pharmaceutical market.
But it has long been a flashpoint in battles over expansion of pharmaceutical companies’ global IP rights, owing to its dynamic generics industry and its willingness to challenge patent provisions both domestically and in foreign jurisdictions.
The revocation of patent protection for medicines in 1972 greatly expanded access to essential medicines, and led to the growth of a globally competitive domestic industry that is often called the “pharmacy of the developing world.”
For example, production of anti-retroviral drugs by Indian generic manufacturers such as Cipla has reduced the cost of life-saving AIDS treatment in Sub-Saharan Africa to just 1% of the cost a decade ago.
Much of this globally valuable capacity was built under a regime of weak – in fact, non-existent – protection for pharmaceutical patents.
But India is now bound by the World Trade Organization’s TRIPS agreement, and has revised its patent laws accordingly, causing widespread anxiety in the developing world about the implications for global provision of affordable medicines.
Indeed, the Gleevec decision is still only a small reversal for Western pharmaceuticals.
Over the last two decades, lobbyists have worked to harmonize and strengthen a far stricter and globally enforceable IP regime.
As a result, there are now numerous overlapping protections for pharmaceutical companies that are very difficult for most developing countries to contest, and that often pit their global obligations against their domestic obligations to protect their citizens’ lives and health.
According to the Indian Supreme Court, the country’s amended patent law still places greater weight on social objectives than in the US and elsewhere: the standards of non-obviousness and novelty required to obtain a patent are stricter (especially as they pertain to medicines), and no “evergreening” of existing patents – or patent protection for incremental follow-up innovations – is allowed.
The court thus reaffirmed India’s primary commitment to protecting its citizens’ lives and health.
The decision also highlighted an important fact: Despite its severe limitations, the TRIPS agreement does have some (rarely used) safeguards that give developing countries a certain degree of flexibility to limit patent protection.
That is why the pharmaceutical industry, the US, and others have pushed since its inception for a wider and stronger set of standards through add-on agreements.
Such agreements would, for example, limit opposition to patent applications; prohibit national regulatory authorities from approving generic medicines until patents have expired; maintain data exclusivity, thereby delaying the approval of biogeneric drugs; and require new forms of protection, such as anti-counterfeiting measures.
There is a curious incoherence in the argument that the Indian decision undermines property rights.
A critical institutional foundation for well-functioning property rights is an independent judiciary to enforce them.
India’s Supreme Court has shown that it is independent, interprets the law faithfully, and does not easily succumb to global corporate interests.
It is now up to the Indian government to use the TRIPS agreement’s safeguards to ensure that the country’s intellectual-property regime advances both innovation and public health.
Globally, there is growing recognition of the need for a more balanced IP regime.
But the pharmaceutical industry, trying to consolidate its gains, has been pushing instead for an ever stronger and more imbalanced IP regime.
Countries considering agreements like the Trans-Pacific Partnership or bilateral “partnership” agreements with the US and Europe need to be aware that this is one of the hidden objectives.
What are being sold as “free-trade agreements” include IP provisions that could stifle access to affordable medicines, with a potentially significant impact on economic growth and development.
The Politics of Anger
CAMBRIDGE – Perhaps the only surprising thing about the populist backlash that has overwhelmed the politics of many advanced democracies is that it has taken so long.
Even two decades ago, it was easy to predict that mainstream politicians’ unwillingness to offer remedies for the insecurities and inequalities of our hyper-globalized age would create political space for demagogues with easy solutions.
Back then, it was Ross Perot and Patrick Buchanan; today it is Donald Trump, Marine Le Pen, and sundry others.
History never quite repeats itself, but its lessons are important nonetheless.
We should recall that the first era of globalization, which reached its peak in the decades before World War I, eventually produced an even more severe political backlash.
The historical evidence has been well summarized by my Harvard colleague Jeffry Frieden.
In the heyday of the gold standard, Frieden argues, mainstream political actors had to downplay social reform and national identity because they gave priority to international economic ties.
The response took one of two fatal forms in the interwar period: Socialists and communists chose social reform, while fascists chose national assertion.
Both paths led away from globalization to economic closure (and far worse).
Today’s backlash most likely will not go quite so far.
As costly as they have been, the dislocations of the great recession and the euro crisis pale in significance compared to those of the Great Depression.
Advanced democracies have built – and retain (despite recent setbacks) – extensive social safety nets in the form of unemployment insurance, retirement pensions, and family benefits.
The world economy now has functional international institutions – such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Trade Organization (WTO) – that it lacked prior to the Second World War.
Last but not least, extremist political movements such as fascism and communism have been largely discredited.
Still, the conflicts between a hyper-globalized economy and social cohesion are real, and mainstream political elites ignore them at their peril.
As I argued in my 1997 book Has Globalization Gone Too Far?, the internationalization of markets for goods, services, and capital drives a wedge between the cosmopolitan, professional, skilled groups that are able to take advantage of it and the rest of society.
Two types of political cleavage are exacerbated in the process: an identity cleavage, revolving around nationhood, ethnicity, or religion, and an income cleavage, revolving around social class.
Populists derive their appeal from one or the other of these cleavages.
Right-wing populists such as Trump engage in identity politics.
Left-wing populists such as Bernie Sanders emphasize the gulf between the rich and the poor.
In both cases, there is a clear “other” toward which anger can be directed.
You can barely make ends meet?
It is the Chinese who have been stealing your jobs.
Upset by crime?
It is the Mexicans and other immigrants who bring their gang warfare into the country.
Terrorism?
Why, Muslims, of course.
Political corruption?
What do you expect when the big banks are bankrolling our political system?
Unlike mainstream political elites, populists can easily point to the culprits responsible for the masses’ ills.
Of course, establishment politicians are compromised because they have been at the helm all this time.
But they are also immobilized by their central narrative, which smacks of inaction and helplessness.
This narrative puts the blame for stagnant wages and rising inequality on technological forces beyond our control.
It treats globalization and the rules that sustain it as inexorable and inevitable.
The remedy it offers, investment in education and skills, promises few immediate rewards and would bear fruit years from now, at best.
In reality, today’s world economy is the product of explicit decisions that governments have made in the past.
It was a choice not to stop at the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and to build the much more ambitious – and intrusive – WTO.
Similarly, it will be a choice whether to ratify future mega-trade deals such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership.
It was the choice of governments to loosen regulations on finance and aim for full cross-border capital mobility, just as it was a choice to maintain these policies largely intact, despite a massive global financial crisis.
And, as Anthony Atkinson reminds us in his masterful book on inequality, even technological change is not immune from government agency: There is much that policymakers can do to influence the direction of technological change and ensure that it leads to higher employment and greater equity.
The appeal of populists is that they give voice to the anger of the excluded.
They offer a grand narrative as well as concrete, if misleading and often dangerous, solutions.
Mainstream politicians will not regain lost ground until they, too, offer serious solutions that provide room for hope.
They should no longer hide behind technology or unstoppable globalization, and they must be willing to be bold and entertain large-scale reforms in the way the domestic and global economy are run.
If one lesson of history is the danger of globalization running amok, another is the malleability of capitalism.
It was the New Deal, the welfare state, and controlled globalization (under the Bretton Woods regime) that eventually gave market-oriented societies a new lease on life and produced the post-war boom.
It was not tinkering and minor modification of existing policies that produced these achievements, but radical institutional engineering.
Moderate politicians, take note.
The Problem With “Illiberal Democracy”
PRINCETON – Poland’s turn toward authoritarian rule has set off alarm bells across the European Union and within NATO.
Since coming to power in October, Jarosław Kaczyński’s Law and Justice party (PiS) has attacked the country’s Constitutional Court, politicized the judiciary and the civil service, and launched an assault on media pluralism.
Critics of the PiS government, which is led by Prime Minister Beata Szydło (with Kaczyński, ruling from behind the scenes as he holds no official post), have described its actions as a blitz to install “illiberal democracy,” similar to what Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán has done in his country over the past six years.
But to call what is being constructed in Poland illiberal democracy is deeply misleading – and in a way that undermines efforts to rein in would-be autocrats like Kaczyński and Orbán.
After all, it is not just liberalism that is under attack, but democracy itself.
The concept of “illiberal democracy,” attributable to a 1997 essay by the American foreign-policy thinker Fareed Zakaria, was an effort to describe regimes that held elections, but did not observe the rule of law and regularly overrode their political systems’ constitutional checks and balances.
It was an idea born of disillusion.
In the heady days after the fall of communism, a kind of democratic ecstasy prevailed (at least in the West).
The “end of history” had been achieved, and elections, representative institutions, and the rule of law would, it seemed, always go neatly together.
Soon, however, newly empowered electorates were voting in majorities that used their power to oppress minorities and violate fundamental rights.
The implication was clear: Democracy on its own was not enough.
Liberalism – the protection of minorities and individual civil liberties – had to be strengthened.
The word “liberalism,” however, does not mean the same thing to all people.
In many circles, it came to be used to describe unfettered capitalism and full freedom of choice in personal lifestyles.
And it was the alternative meanings that initially allowed politicians like Orbán and the Turkish leader Recep Tayyip Erdoğan to make the case for a different form of majoritarian democracy.
Erdoğan, emphasizing traditional Islamic morality, started to present himself as a “conservative democrat.”
Orbán, in a controversial speech in 2014, declared his desire to create an “illiberal state.”
More recently, during the refugee crisis, Orbán announced the end of the era of what he called “liberal blah blah” and predicted that Europe would come around to his “Christian and national” vision of politics.
To be sure, the phrase “illiberal democracy” is not necessarily a contradiction in terms.
Throughout the nineteenth and twentieth century, many European Christian Democrats would have called themselves “illiberal.”
In fact, they might have been offended if one questioned their staunch anti-liberalism.
What this did not mean, however, is that they failed to understand and recognize the importance of minority rights in a functioning democracy (after all, minorities can become the majority in the next election).
Nor did it mean that they believed unelected institutions like constitutional courts were somehow undemocratic.
They associated “liberalism” with individualism, materialism and, very often, atheism; but being anti-liberal did not mean rejecting the importance of rights or independent institutions.
What governments like those in Poland, Hungary, and Turkey are proposing is something very different.
It is one thing to criticize materialism, atheism, or even individualism.
It is something else altogether to attempt to limit freedom of speech and assembly, media pluralism, or the protection of minorities.
The first is a disagreement about different political philosophies that can justify democracy.
The second is an attack on democracy’s very foundations.
An election, after all, can be undemocratic even if the ruling party refrains from stuffing ballot boxes.
If opposition parties have been hindered in making their case to the electorate, and journalists do not dare to report on the government’s failures, the ballot boxes have already been stuffed.
It is no accident that many of the democracies that emerged after the fall of communism established constitutional courts to protect rights and preserve pluralism.
These institutions ultimately secure and sustain democracy.
As long as critics keep using the phrase “illiberal democracy” to describe what is happening in countries like Poland, leaders like Kaczyński will simply say, “Exactly!”
Far from being received as a criticism, the phrase reinforces such leaders’ image as opponents of liberalism, while allowing them to continue to refer to their actions as “democratic” – which, for all the disappointments over the last quarter-century, is still the most important prerequisite for inclusion in the geopolitical “West.”
Furthermore, the expression “illiberal democracy” confirms the narrative that democracy is the domain of national governments – and that it is the European Union that is pushing undemocratic liberalism.
This allows figures like Kaczyński and Orbán to paint the EU as the agent of rampant capitalism and libertine morality.
The fact that Europe’s new authoritarians have come to power through free and fair elections does not lend democratic legitimacy to their efforts to transform entire political systems to their own advantage.
Instead of describing them as “illiberal” we should be calling them what they really are: “undemocratic.”
Theresa May’s Pyrrhic Victory
LONDON – The British election called by Prime Minister Theresa May for June 8 will transform the outlook for Britain’s politics and its relationship with Europe, but not necessarily in the way that a vastly increased majority for May’s Conservative Party might seem to imply.
The scorched-earth defeat that Conservative Euroskeptics expect to inflict on Britain’s internationalist and progressive forces was symbolized by the Daily Mail headline on May’s election announcement: “Crush the Saboteurs.”
But June’s resounding victory could ultimately lead to an even more stunning reversal, like Napoleon’s hubristic march on Moscow after he had destroyed all opposition in Western Europe.
Britain’s pro-European progressive forces could still snatch victory from the jaws of defeat for three related reasons.
First, by bringing forward the British election, May has effectively extended the deadline for Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union from 2019 until 2022.
The early election makes it inevitable that Britain will formally leave the EU in March 2019, because May will no longer face even the theoretical possibility of parliamentary opposition.
But it also allows Britain to accept a long transition period after the 2019 departure deadline, so that businesses and administrative systems can adjust to whatever terms are agreed by then.
British business lobbies, as well as the government officials tasked with implementation, have been pressing for this transition period to be as long as possible.
The EU, however, has insisted that during the transition period all of the current obligations of EU membership must continue, including budget contributions, free movement of labor, and enforcement of EU legal judgments.
Until the election was called, it seemed almost impossible to reconcile the business community’s need for a long transition period with the insistence of Conservative Euroskeptics on a complete and immediate break with the EU.
A crushing election victory will give May the necessary authority to negotiate a long transition, despite the objections of anti-EU extremists, and will persuade more moderate Euroskeptics that, with Brexit now guaranteed, the precise timing of various EU obligations is less important.
As a result, although Britain will formally cease to be an EU member by March 2019, very little will change in Britain’s economy or way of life by the time of the next general election in 2022.
In this sense, May’s decision to call an early election is a setback for extreme Euroskeptics, who might otherwise have forced her to break completely with Europe by March 2019.
This relates to a second reason why the imminent triumph for British Euroskeptics may end up a pyrrhic victory.
Whereas the early election will delay economic changes, it will greatly accelerate the transformation of British politics.
Britain’s main opposition Labour Party has been in its death throes since 2015, but could survive in its present zombie condition until a general election was called.
Because the next election was expected in 2020, it was possible that some unforeseen development in the three years might allow Labour to revive.
By bringing the election forward, May has brought forward Labour’s disintegration as well, and virtually eliminated the possibility of its revival.
When the Labour Party collapses after its defeat in June, a realignment of progressive British politics will become almost certain.
This realignment, uniting disillusioned Labour politicians and voters with Liberal Democrats, Greens, and perhaps Scottish and Welsh nationalists, is likely to produce an opposition that is much more effective than May currently faces, even if it has fewer parliamentary seats.
By the time of the next general election, most likely in 2022, Britain’s internationalist and progressive political forces will have had five years to prepare themselves to oppose May’s conservatism and English nationalism.
By that time, the Conservatives will have been in power for three parliaments and 12 years.
That is about how long it has typically taken Britain’s political pendulum to swing between right and left.
Moreover, owing to the extended transition period for Brexit made possible by the early election, it will only be around 2022 that the full consequences of terminating EU membership come into view, together with the contradictions in the Brexit coalition between libertarian free traders and socially conservative nationalists and protectionists.
Meanwhile, efforts to negotiate free-trade agreements with the US and China will have revealed the weakness of Britain’s bargaining position.
As a result, public opinion about the wisdom of Brexit could shift substantially by 2022.
In any case, the changing relationship with Europe will be the core issue around which Britain’s socially liberal and internationalist political forces can coalesce after their defeat.
Suppose that, in the meantime, the EU continues its economic recovery.
Suppose further that, after the French and German elections this year, a stronger Franco-German partnership drives the eurozone toward the closer political integration that is obviously needed for the single currency to succeed, whereas Denmark, Sweden, and Poland make clear that they have no intention of ever joining the euro.
By 2022, British voters could well decide that re-joining a twin-track European Union is much more attractive than pleading for a junior partnership with the US, not to mention China.
That is the third reason why Britain’s Conservative Euroskeptics could end up regretting their imminent electoral triumph.
Whatever happens, the decisive battle in the war for Britain’s long-term future will not be this year’s easy victory for May. It will be the clash, five years from now, between nationalist conservatism and a new outward-looking progressive opposition.
The Three Trumps
NEW YORK – Never in recent history has a change of leadership attracted as much attention and speculation as Donald Trump’s rise to the US presidency.
What this change signifies and what it portends requires unraveling three mysteries, because there are three versions of Trump.
The first Trump is the friend of Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Trump’s enthusiasm for Putin is the most consistent part of his rhetoric.
Despite a worldview that regards the United States as a victim of foreign powers – China, Mexico, Iran, the European Union – Trump’s ardor for Putin burns bright.
Depending on who is opining, Trump is either a naive admirer of strongmen like Putin or a long-time tool of Russian intelligence.
There is almost surely a backstory here, one that could destroy Trump’s administration if some of the lurid rumors are confirmed.
We now know that some key dates and details in the infamous “dossier” on Trump’s relations with Putin, assembled by a former British intelligence officer, have been verified.
A growing body of circumstantial evidence suggests that Trump has been backed by Russian money for decades.
Russian oligarchs may have saved Trump from personal bankruptcy, and one reportedly traveled to a number of Trump’s campaign stops, perhaps acting as a go-between with the Kremlin.
And many top members of Trump’s team – including his first campaign manager, Paul Manafort; recently-ousted National Security Adviser Michael Flynn; former ExxonMobil CEO and now Secretary of State Rex Tillerson; and hedge-fund magnate and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross – all have significant business dealings with Russia or Russian oligarchs.
The second version of Trump is a greedy businessman.
Trump seems intent on transforming the presidency into another source of personal wealth.
For most people, the presidency would seem to be its own reward, without cashing in (at least not while in office).
Not for Trump.
Contrary to all previous norms, and in violation of the standards set by the Office of Government Ethics, Trump is keeping his business empire, while family members maneuver to monetize the Trump name in new investments around the world.
The third Trump is a populist and demagogue.
Trump is a non-stop font of lies, who brushes aside the inevitable corrections by the media with the charge of “fake news.”
For the first time in modern American history, the president is aggressively demonizing the press.
This past week, the White House barred the New York Times, CNN, Politico, and the Los Angeles Times from a news briefing by the press secretary.
On some interpretations, Trump’s demagogy is in the service of his chief strategist, Stephen Bannon, who defends a dark vision of a coming war of civilizations.
By raising fear to the highest possible level, Trump aims to create a violent America-first nationalism.
Hermann Göring chillingly explained the formula from his Nuremberg jail cell after World War II: “[T]he people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders.
That is easy.
All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger.
It works the same way in any country.”
Another theory is that all three Trumps – friend of Putin, wealth maximizer, and demagogue – are really one: Trump the businessman has long been supported by the Russians, who have used him for years as a front for laundered money.
One might say they won the jackpot, parlaying a small bet – on manipulating the outcome of an election they most likely never expected him to win – into a huge payoff.
On this interpretation, Trump’s attacks on the press, the intelligence agencies, and the FBI specifically aim to discredit these organizations in advance of further revelations regarding his dealings with Russia.
Those of us who lived through Watergate remember how difficult it was to hold Richard Nixon to account.
Without the revelation of secret White House tapes, Nixon almost surely would have escaped impeachment and served out his term.
The same was true with Flynn, who lied time and again to the public, and to Vice President Michael Pence, about his communications with the Russian ambassador before he assumed his post.
Yet, like Nixon, he was tripped up only because his lies were recorded, in this case by the US intelligence agencies.
When Flynn’s lies were exposed, Trump’s reaction, characteristically, was to attack the leak, not the lies.
The main lesson of Washington, and indeed of strongman politics in general, is that lying is the first, not last, resort.
If Congress has enough honest members, a majority, knowing that Republicans will not police Republicans, will demand an independent investigation of Trump’s Russia ties.
Republican Senator Rand Paul was explicit on this point, declaring that it “makes no sense” for Republicans to investigate Republicans.
Trump seems intent on turning up the pressure on the FBI, the intelligence agencies, the courts, and the media to back off.
Demagogues survive because of public support, which they try to maintain through appeals to greed, nationalism, patriotism, racism, and fear.
They shower their supporters with short-lived cash, in the form of tax cuts and income transfers, paid for by running up the public debt and leaving the bill to future generations.
Trump has so far kept America’s plutocrats happy, through promises of unaffordable tax cuts, while mesmerizing his white working-class followers with executive orders to deport illegal immigrants and bar arrivals from Muslim-majority countries.
None of this has made Trump very popular.
His approval ratings are historically low for a new president, around 40%, with roughly 55% of respondents disapproving.
Judicial challenges to executive actions, fights with the media, tensions stemming from rising budget deficits, and new revelations regarding Trump and Russia, will keep the pot boiling – and Trump’s public support could evaporate.
In that case, Republican leaders are more likely to turn on Trump.
But no one should ever underestimate a demagogue’s willingness to use fear and violence – even war – to maintain power.
And if Putin is indeed his backer and partner, Trump’s temptations will be strong.
Trade Truths for Trumpians and Brexiteers
LONDON – Here’s a reality check for British and American policymakers, and for the many pundits who frequently comment on world trade without understanding its realities: data on Germany’s total exports and imports in 2016 indicate that its largest trading partner is now China. France and the United States have been pushed into second and third place.
This news should not come as a surprise.
I have often mused that, by 2020, German companies (and policymakers) might prefer a monetary union with China to one with France, given that German-Chinese trade would likely continue to grow.
And so it has, driven primarily by Chinese exports to Germany. But German exports to China have also been increasing.
Notwithstanding a recent slowdown, Germany could soon export more to China than to its crucial neighbor and partner France, and it already exports more to China than it does to Italy.
For German exporters, France and the UK are the only European national markets larger than China.
Seasoned observers of international trade tend to follow two general rules.
First, the level of trade between two countries often decreases as the geographic distance between them increases.
And, second, a country is likely to conduct more trade with big countries that have strong domestic demand, rather than with smaller countries that have weak demand.
The latest German trade data confirm both rules, but especially the second one.
A big but geographically distant country is different not only in size, but also in kind from a smaller one.
This is too often forgotten in discussions about trade agreements, especially in such charged political atmospheres as currently prevail in the United Kingdom and the US.
In the UK, the House of Commons has already adopted a bill to establish a process for withdrawing from the European Union; but the House of Lords is now demanding that the bill be amended to protect EU nationals living in the UK.
In my own brief contribution to the marathon House of Lords debate last month, I argued that, even if Brexit is not the UK’s biggest economic-policy challenge today, it will likely exacerbate other problems, including persistently low productivity growth, weak education and skills-training programs, and geographic inequalities.
Moreover, I warned that the UK will need to adopt a far more focused and ambitious approach to trade, not unlike that of China or India, if it is to fare well after Brexit.
Sadly, the UK’s post-Brexit trade strategy is being determined by internal politics, such that it is “patriotic” to focus on new trade deals with Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and others in the Commonwealth, while ignoring harsh economic realities.
New Zealand may be a beautiful country, but it does not have an especially large economy, and it is a very long way from the UK.
In fact, despite its massive problems, Greece’s economy is still larger than New Zealand’s.
Many UK policymakers – and all members of the “Leave” campaign – are ignoring the likely costs of exiting the EU single market.
But this factor alone demands serious attention, given the single market’s size and close geographic proximity.
It is very important that the UK maintain strong trade ties with many EU member states after Brexit.
To that end, Britain should be shoring up its exports of services, a sector where it arguably still has a real net natural advantage.
At the same time, the UK should urgently be trying to take its relationship with China – or what former British Prime Minister David Cameron called the “golden relationship” – to a new level.
If there is any country with which the UK should want to strike a new trade agreement, surely it is China.
During my brief spell in the British government, I helped then-Chancellor George Osborne persuade Cameron that we should aspire to make China our third-largest export market within a decade.
Does the new government still consider this a priority?
Beyond China, Britain also needs to be far more focused on its trade ties with India, Indonesia, and Nigeria, all of which will have significant influence in the world economy and global trading patterns in the coming decades.
In the US, President Donald Trump and his economic-policy advisers need to return to reality, especially on trade.
They can start by studying Germany’s trade patterns, especially vis-à-vis China.
To be sure, China has a large bilateral trade surplus with the US; but it also constitutes an expanding export market for US companies.
And if trends from the last 10-15 years continue, China could soon supplant Canada and Mexico as America’s most important export market.
As Chinese household income continues to rise, demand for some of America's most competitive goods and services will only increase.
Trump, rather than spewing nonsense about China manipulating its currency, should be encouraging market forces to rebalance bilateral trade.
The same can be said for the US’s overall external deficit.
Unless the US can boost its savings rate relative to its internal investment needs, it will continue to need foreign capital inflows.
And this, in turn, will require it to maintain a trade and current-account imbalance.
Finally, by pushing for a renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement, Trump is taking a risk similar to that of the Brexiteers.
Despite China’s recent gains, Canada and Mexico are still close neighbors and crucial trade partners.
By potentially disrupting import patterns with all three countries, Trump’s policies are more likely to push up import prices, while jeopardizing US export growth.
The Trans-Pacific Shell Game
ROME – The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade agreement is being portrayed as a boon for all 12 of the countries involved.
But opposition to the agreement may be the only issue that the remaining US presidential candidates can agree on, and Canada’s trade minister has expressed serious reservations about it.
Are the TPP’s critics being unreasonable?
In a word, no.
To be sure, the TPP might help the US to advance its goal of containing China’s influence in the Asia-Pacific region, exemplified in US President Barack Obama’s declaration that, “With TPP, China does not set the rules in that region; we do.”
But the economic case is not nearly as strong.
In fact, though the TPP will bring some benefits, they will mainly accrue to large corporations and come at the expense of ordinary citizens.
In terms of gains, one US government study on the topic projected that, by 2025, the TPP would augment its member countries’ GDP growth by a meager 0.1% at most.
More recently, the US International Trade Commission (ITC) estimated that, by 2032, the TPP would increase America’s economic growth by 0.15% ($42.7 billion) and boost incomes by 0.23% ($57.3 billion).
But TPP advocates have largely ignored these results, preferring to cite two studies by the Peterson Institute of International Economics, a well-known cheerleader for economic globalization.
In 2012, the PIIE claimed that the TPP would boost total GDP in member countries by 0.4% after ten years.
In January, it declared that TPP would augment total GDP by 0.5% over the next 15 years.
In a World Bank study released the same month, the authors of the PIIE research projected a 1.1% average increase in GDP in TPP member countries by 2030.
Something is clearly amiss.
A closer look reveals that these studies’ findings concerning the TPP’s purported benefits lack supporting economic theory, credible modeling, or empirical evidence.
The only advantages presented that are consistent with mainstream research methodology are tariff-related trade benefits.
But if the PIIE authors had used conventional methods to estimate total gains from trade, such benefits would comprise a very small share of the alleged gains from the TPP.
According to the PIIE and the World Bank, about 85% of overall growth from the TPP is due to “non-trade measures” and related foreign investments.
Meanwhile, the studies ignore employment and income distribution – where some of the leading risks of trade liberalization lie.
Instead, they simply assume that all countries are at full employment and have a consistent income distribution, trade balance, and fiscal position.
The ITC study, which used a slightly different model, predicts an increase in the trade deficit that would destroy 129,484 American jobs (yet, inexplicably, it estimates that the TPP would raise employment by 128,000 jobs).
It also projects a net increase in exports of $25.2 billion in 2032 (in 2032 US dollars), a small fraction of the PIIE’s projection of $357 billion in 2030 (in 2015 dollars).
For our study, my colleagues and I used the PIIE’s own 2012 estimates of trade-related gains, despite our reservations, along with more realistic economic specifications, including for income distribution and employment.
We projected downward wage pressure, which, by depressing domestic demand, would lead to lower employment and higher inequality in all country groupings.
Projected job losses would total some 771,000 across the TPP countries, including 448,000 in the US alone.
These losses would offset any growth benefits, with the US and Japan suffering small net income losses (-0.5% and -0.1%, respectively).
Even if the TPP is found to conflict with the national or public interest, participating countries are obliged to follow its provisions.
Powerful lobbies, mainly from the US, made sure of that.
And, unfortunately, that is not all they did.
Despite being portrayed as a trade deal, the TPP is not even really about trade.
Many TPP countries are already among the world’s most open economies, with most merchandise trade among them having already been liberalized by earlier agreements and unilateral initiatives.
The main remaining trade constraints involve non-tariff barriers, such as US agricultural subsidies, which the TPP does not address.
Instead, the TPP’s most important provisions strengthen, broaden, and extend intellectual property rights.
That will give pharmaceutical companies much longer monopolies on patented medicines and keep cheaper options – both generics and alternatives that are deemed too similar – off the market, hurting both consumers and governments that provide subsidies.
Moreover, the TPP weakens national regulation, such as over financial services, and strengthens the rights of foreign investors, at the expense of local businesses and the public interest.
Investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) provisions allow foreign investors to pursue binding private arbitration against governments if new regulations reduce their expected future profits.
Governments that lose those lawsuits will be obliged to compensate foreign investors; but even those that win will incur high legal costs.
In fact, potential ISDS compensation payments or settlements alone could far outweigh the TPP’s limited economic benefits.
Fear of incurring such high costs are likely to weaken governments’ incentives to implement regulations that hurt foreign corporate interests, even if they serve the public good.
Finally, though the TPP’s biggest impact will lie outside the trade realm, the agreement has been used to undermine multilateral trade-liberalization efforts.
The most obvious victim has been the World Trade Organization’s ongoing Doha Development Round negotiations, but Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation and the ASEAN Economic Community will also suffer.
The TPP’s advocates have, for years, been grossly exaggerating the deal’s projected benefits, while downplaying its potentially high risks and costs, most of which will be incurred by ordinary citizens.
The reality is that the TPP will have a barely perceptible impact on GDP, benefit large corporations almost exclusively, and significantly constrain the policy space governments need to accelerate economic development and protect the public interest.
Some partnership that is.
The Roots of Western Tribalism
ABU DHABI – In Hermann Hesse’s novel Journey to the East, the character of H.H., a novice in a religious group known as The League, describes a figurine depicting himself next to the group’s leader, Leo.
“It seemed that, in time, all the substance from one image would flow into the other and only one would remain: Leo.
He must grow, I must disappear.”
Hesse is describing the sacrifice of an individual self for the sake of a larger cause.
But he is also depicting how people create their heroes.
Whether it is Vladimir Lenin, Che Guevara, Ruhollah Khomeini, Hugo Chávez, or even Donald Trump, “heroes” are in the eye of the beholder.
They are idealized reflections of the self.
And as Hesse’s description implies, the heroic image also feeds off of the self, to the point that the individual must disappear.
Tribalism is at the heart of this process.
Because mankind has a deep yearning for a sense of belonging and for leadership, humans naturally form groups with established leaders.
Some groups are positive manifestations of collaboration and solidarity among individuals.
But when groups are based on an ideology or a particular tribe, they can become discriminatory and oppressive toward non-members, especially if a domineering, charismatic leader is in charge.
The emergence of populist and nationalist movements in the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and other European countries suggests that tribalism is on the rise in the West.
Populist movements have set their sights on immigrants and globalization generally.
But, as with all forms of tribalism, these movements pose the greatest danger to the individual.
Followers are obliged to pay fealty to the tribe and its chief.
But because the tribe brooks no dissent, tribal parties tend to degenerate quickly into competing factions.
Explanations of what has led to our new era of tribal politics abound.
For many, the root cause is growing economic inequality.
While the rich have gotten richer, rural blue-collar workers and the poor have been left to fend for themselves against immigrants, refugees, and the forces of globalization.
But even if globalization has benefited some groups and regions more than others, it doesn’t explain today’s tribal politics; if anything, the lack of globalization in certain regions does.
It is worth remembering that most Trump voters were neither poor nor blue collar.
But they do largely reside in peripheral regions and smaller cities where the benefits of globalization – though not the costs – have been largely absent.
This same urban-rural split is evident in every country that has experienced an uptick in tribal populism in recent years.
Moreover, if globalization, and specifically immigration, are drivers of inequality, then the large cities where refugees, immigrants, and poorer communities share the same space should be sites of political upheaval.
And yet in Austria, France, Germany, the Netherlands, the UK, and elsewhere, nationalist and populist parties tend to find their supporters outside of the main cities.
Although globalization and immigration can be political pressure points, the roots of voting behavior today lie in three interrelated developments.
First, citizens in the West have gradually become less politically organized and more individualistic.
Across all liberal democracies, membership in political parties has long been declining, owing to post-war changes in education, social norms, and popular culture that emphasize critical thinking and self-expression.
The result is what the American sociologist David Riesman has called “inner-directed individuals” – “Cartesian” men and women who think for themselves.
This development would have been indisputably positive had it not overlapped with Western economies’ shift, beginning sometime in the mid-1990s, toward technology-driven growth models, which increased demand for so-called STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) skills.
As education systems began to focus far less on the humanities, citizens, already less exposed to the political education and guidance offered by traditional political parties, were increasingly cut off from the transmission of humanistic values as well.
The rationale for studying literature, history, and art – to learn empathy, develop our emotional intelligence, and reconcile critical thinking with universal values – has not disappeared with the opportunities to do so.
The false assumption that a humanities degree is less valuable than a STEM degree in the twenty-first-century labor market does not bode well for the functioning of liberal democracy.
The third consideration is an extension of the second: the increasing commodification and marketization of higher education in recent decades.
As universities vie for accreditation and “me too” status, their programs have increasingly begun to resemble one another.
The process of molding “test-ready individuals” recalls a line from Leo Tolstoy’s Anna Karenina: “As for this Petersburg swell, they’re turned out by machinery, all on one pattern, and all precious rubbish.”
Likewise, the commodification of knowledge makes today’s graduates more disposable: vulnerable to replacement by the “machinery” that produced them.
Taken together, these three developments help to explain the rise of a new class of voters: highly skilled, highly paid, and poorly educated in the values underpinning liberal democracy.
It is not particularly surprising that these voters, bereft of shared traditions of knowledge and understanding, coalesce around tribal identities and the surrender of self to a collective consciousness.
Liberal democracies had supposedly moved beyond “primordial” politics, toward a society of empowered citizens.
But citizens’ power – their ability to identify their interests and to act individually and collectively to advance them – requires a set of skills altogether different from those being emphasized today.
The Trump Administration’s Economic Potential
TOKYO – President Donald Trump’s unpredictable approach to policymaking has fueled widespread concern about where the United States is headed.
Yet America’s stock market has performed well since Trump’s election, faltering only when his administration’s political future appears to be in doubt.
That is no accident: on the economic front, Trump’s approach might have some redeeming qualities.
From the outset, the Trump administration has maintained a pro-business attitude, exemplified by his commitment to deregulation, raising hopes among investors of a boost to the US and global economies.
To be sure, efforts to roll back, say, environmental protections will ultimately do serious harm to the US, even if they allow some companies to improve their bottom line in the short term.
But the Trump administration’s eagerness to free financial markets of excessive regulation may ultimately prove beneficial for all.
When regulations become too cumbersome, they can do more harm than good.
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, signed into law by President Barack Obama in 2010, is a good example.
The Dodd-Frank legislation contains rules that have impeded the functioning of the international monetary market: by raising US dollar funding costs for foreign banks, the rule compromised so-called covered interest parity.
For Japan, this undermined the transmission of monetary easing in international financial markets – a mechanism that was already strained by risk-averse investors flocking to the Japanese yen as a safe-haven currency.
With Trump removing friction-causing regulations and inspiring stock-market confidence, the Bank of Japan may finally be able to limit the yen’s appreciation, thereby spurring inflation, employment, and the stock market.
Another reason for optimism about the US and world economies is rooted in the Trump administration’s $1 trillion plan to rebuild America’s infrastructure.
Unfortunately, Trump’s equivocation about the white supremacist violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, earlier this month destroyed the last traces of goodwill he may have had in the US Congress.
With two business advisory councils having been disbanded in the wake of the Charlottesville incident, following an exodus of CEOs critical of Trump’s response, plans for an infrastructure advisory council have now also been dropped.
But political disarray is far from the only potential threat to Trump’s economic success.
His administration’s trade policy is based on serious misconceptions.
Trump and his advisers seem to believe that only balanced bilateral trade is fair and, therefore, desirable.
In fact, such balance is very difficult to achieve in an open trading system, and pursuing it would actually be damaging, as it would undermine the overall benefits gained through trade.
After World War II, high inflation in Japan undermined confidence in the yen’s stability, leading many Japanese to barter.
Tokyoites, for example, traded their precious garments, from wedding dresses to fine kimonos, with rural farmers for rice and vegetables.
The system worked, because, at that moment, demand and supply happened to be exactly matched.
But that balance was fundamentally coincidental; it could not be expected to endure changing economic circumstances.
That is why barter economies are so inefficient – and thus obsolete.
Modern systems use money, because, as a store of value, it serves as a kind of buffer, removing the need for a perfect balance between supply and demand, and enabling all actors to get what they need from trade.
As Trump attempts to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico, he would do well to remember this.
As it stands, his administration seems eager to impose limits on US imports from NAFTA countries.
If the only thing that changed about NAFTA members’ behavior was that they exported less to the US, America workers could benefit, with US farmers or manufacturers – including much of Trump’s own electoral base – becoming more competitive within the US market.
But that is not going to happen.
Instead, America’s NAFTA partners will respond strategically to limits on their exports, adjusting their trade relationships with each other and with others, in order to mitigate the impact of US import controls.
Protectionist behavior by the US could even trigger a trade war, as occurred after the introduction of the Smoot-Hawley Tariff in 1930, in which case everyone would lose.
To develop a more effective trade policy, the Trump administration must acknowledge what current-account balances are and are not.
Trump has often condemned countries like China and Germany, because he views their surpluses as direct corollaries to America’s deficit.
He assumes that they are somehow “ripping off” the US – taking advantage of America’s market, while undermining the competitiveness of its companies.
But, as Martin Feldstein and George Shultz recently put it, “if a country consumes more than it produces, it must import more than it exports.
That’s not a rip-off; that’s arithmetic.”
And, in fact, if the US managed to negotiate a reduction in, say, China’s trade surplus vis-à-vis the US, the US would simply have to increase its deficit with some other country to make up for it.
A better way to understand a current-account surplus (or deficit) is as a measure of a country’s saving (or dissaving) toward the future.
In other words, a country’s current account reflects how it allocates its income between the present and the future.
If the US wants to reduce its own deficits, it should start saving more.
The US is undoubtedly facing serious political challenges, exacerbated by a mercurial, polarizing, and brash administration.
But, economically, the country remains on sound footing.
If, as I believe, US policymakers genuinely want to strengthen the economy, they are in a good position to do so, benefiting not just the stock market, but ordinary Americans as well.
Trump’s Growth Charade
WASHINGTON, DC – Officials in President Donald Trump’s administration frequently talk about getting annual economic growth in the United States back above 3%.
But they are doing more than just talking about it; their proposed budget actually assumes that they will succeed.
If they do, it would represent a significant improvement over recent performance: the US economy has averaged less than 2% annual growth since 2000.
And, while an increase to 3% might sound small, it would make an enormous difference in terms of employment and wages.
Unfortunately, left to its own devices, the economy will most likely continue to sputter.
And the policies that Trump’s Republican Party has proposed – for health care, taxes, and deregulation – will not make much difference.
The assumption of higher growth is more of an accounting smokescreen for tax cuts than anything else.
If administration officials acknowledge that a 3% annual rate is not feasible, they would need to face the reality that their forecasts for tax revenues are too high, and that their proposed tax cuts, if enacted, would dramatically increase the budget deficit and the national debt.
The US economy used to grow at more than 3% per year; in fact, this was the norm in the second half of the twentieth century.
Since then, however, the US has been forced to confront three major constraints.
First, the US population is aging.
As the baby boom generation (born after the end of World War II) retires, the proportion of retired people in the total population increases.
Over time, this demographic shift has reduced US potential annual growth by perhaps as much as half a percentage point.
The details of what will happen to health insurance remain unclear.
But making it harder or more expensive for lower-income and older Americans to get health insurance is not likely to encourage people to work.
The best independent assessment of these policies, produced by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), does not predict any economic miracles – just that around 20 million fewer Americans will have health insurance.
And lurking in the background are potential policies that would restrict legal immigration.
The US currently allows about one million mostly working-age people per year to take up residence and work in the country.
Moreover, immigrants’ tendency to have more children than non-immigrants do keeps the US population growing faster than in other developed countries (for example, in Europe or Japan).
So any move to reduce annual immigration – some Republicans are proposing 500,000 people or fewer – would make 3% annual economic growth even less likely.
The second economic constraint is the slowing rate of productivity growth.
There was a major increase in average output per person in the post-World War II years, as better technology was developed across a wide range of sectors.
And there were hopes in the 1990s that the information technology revolution would have a similar effect.
But the impact on productivity has been disappointing.
Northwestern University economist Robert Gordon’s recent book, The Rise and Fall of American Growth, argues that, despite all the hype from the tech sector, we are unlikely to see a dramatic change on this front.
The Trump administration argues that by reducing taxes and “reforming” healthcare, it can boost productivity – for example, by encouraging capital investment.
But the tax cuts that will soon be on the table are likely to resemble closely those implemented by President George W. Bush’s administration, which did not lead to any kind of economic boom (a point that James Kwak and I examined in detail in our book White House Burning).
The third constraint stems from the 2008 financial crisis.
One danger inherent in pushing for high growth is that it is always possible to juice an economy with short-term measures that encourage a lot of risk-taking and leverage in the financial system.
Deregulation in the 1990s and early 2000s did exactly that, leading to slightly higher growth for a while – and then to a massive crash.
The details of the Trump administration’s plans remain to be determined, but officials will most likely push in the direction of relaxing limits on leverage (thereby allowing banks to borrow more relative to equity).
Any boom generated in this way is likely to end badly – not just financial ruin for millions of individuals, but also a long and difficult recovery.
The two least political and most influential official forecasts – those issued by the CBO and the Federal Reserve’s Open Market Committee – both foresee 2% growth, on average, for the coming decade and perhaps beyond.
Assuming 3% growth is, to put it generously, wishful thinking.
Worse, it is deeply misleading – and potentially dangerous.
If those pushing for tax cuts stick to their guns and refuse to accept reality, their agenda, if enacted, would result in a significantly wider budget deficit, which would increase the national debt to unprecedentedly high levels.
Keeping US Policymaking Honest
BERKELEY – In a recent appearance here at the University of California, Berkeley, Alice Rivlin expressed optimism about the future of economic policymaking in the United States.
What Rivlin – who served as Vice Chair of the US Federal Reserve, Director of the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under President Bill Clinton, and founding Director of the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) – thinks about that topic matters a great deal.
Indeed, America owes its current system of “technocracy” – which ensures that policymaking follows sound analysis and empirical evidence – more to Rivlin than to any other living human.
When she was younger, however, Rivlin was denied admission to the graduate program at Harvard University’s Littauer Center of Public Administration. Her application was rejected, she was told, because of “unfortunate experiences” with previous admissions of “women of marriageable age.”
In those phrases, you can almost hear the New England Puritans’ unctuous sermonizing about the seduction of Eve by the serpent, and her subsequent temptation of Adam.
Of course, when Rivlin helped found the CBO in 1974 she was essentially eating from the Tree of Knowledge, and she was making the rest of us eat from it, too.
We are all better for it.
In her recent talk, Rivlin expressed confidence that, despite today’s populist attacks on expertise, high-quality policy analysis will continue to flourish in the twenty-first-century public sphere.
And she predicted that empirical evidence and expert knowledge will still carry substantial – if not full – weight in decision-making by legislators, presidents, and their advisers.
To be sure, the CBO has never been more influential than it is this year.
Its influence has been felt not merely because of its role in congressional proceedings, but also because it offers assessments that are widely respected across government, the media, and civil society.
Its estimates of how congressional Republicans’ legislative proposals will affect the country are deeply informed, nonpartisan, and made in good faith.
So far, at least, it seems that Rivlin is right to be optimistic.
Still, I have my doubts about the future.
Rivlin believes that there is a general consensus within policymaking circles about basic economic principles, and that those principles will underpin the assessments, estimates, and models used in public-policy debates.
She pointed out that no reputable economists today regard a simple monetary-policy rule as a magic bullet for avoiding depressions and inflationary spirals, whereas many once did.
That is true, as far as it goes.
And yet, until the announcement that Jerome Powell had been selected as the next Fed Chair, Stanford University economist John Taylor was a leading contender.
Taylor is known for having developed his own guideline (the “Taylor rule”) for how central banks should set interest rates.
And he has long clung to this rule, despite a lack of evidence that it would have delivered better results than the Fed’s actual policy decisions since the 1970s.
Moreover, when US President Donald Trump appointed former American Enterprise Institute economist Kevin Hassett to lead the White House Council of Economic Advisers, many expected that Hassett would be a “normal” CEA chairman.
Hassett, we were told, would safeguard the CEA’s credibility, by ensuring that its estimates remained in line with those of the larger policy-analysis community.
And he would understand that agencies and organizations such as the CBO, OMB, Joint Committee on Taxation, Tax Policy Center (TPC), and Center on Budget and Policy Priorities have a principal allegiance to facts, not to some donor or political master.
Yet Hassett has so far spent his time at the CEA tearing down TPC estimates, even though the organization will undoubtedly issue assessments in the future that are as inconvenient for his political adversaries as they are for him today.
According to the near-consensus among policy analysts, the share of corporate taxes borne by labor, and the share of lost revenues from a cut in corporate income tax that will be recouped through increased investment, are both 25%. Yet the CEA, under Hassett, now assumes that both are 82%.
That claim, as well as Hassett’s recent attacks on the TPC, made former US Treasury Secretary Larry Summers angrier than I can ever recall having seen him with respect to a public-policy issue.
According to Summers, Hassett’s analysis is “some combination of dishonest, incompetent, and absurd.”
Benjamin Franklin famously told the American people that the US Constitution would provide them with “a republic, if you can keep it.”
In her long, distinguished career, Rivlin and others like her have provided us with a rational policymaking process – if we can keep it.
America’s Dangerous Anti-Iran Posturing
NEW YORK – In recent weeks, US President Donald Trump and his advisers have joined Saudi Arabia in accusing Iran of being the epicenter of Middle East terrorism.
The US Congress, meanwhile, is readying yet another round of sanctions against Iran.
But the caricature of Iran as “the tip of the spear” of global terrorism, in Saudi King Salman’s words, is not only wrongheaded, but also extremely dangerous, because it could lead to yet another Middle East war.
In fact, that seems to be the goal of some US hotheads, despite the obvious fact that Iran is on the same side as the United States in opposing the Islamic State (ISIS).
And then there’s the fact that Iran, unlike most of its regional adversaries, is a functioning democracy.
Ironically, the escalation of US and Saudi rhetoric came just two days after Iran’s May 19 election, in which moderates led by incumbent President Hassan Rouhani defeated their hardline opponents at the ballot box.
Perhaps for Trump, the pro-Saudi, anti-Iran embrace is just another business proposition.
He beamed at Saudi Arabia’s decision to buy $110 billion of new US weapons, describing the deal as “jobs, jobs, jobs,” as if the only gainful employment for American workers requires them to stoke war.
And who knows what private deals for Trump and his family might also be lurking in his warm embrace of Saudi belligerence.
The Trump administration’s bombast toward Iran is, in a sense, par for the course.
US foreign policy is littered with absurd, tragic, and hugely destructive foreign wars that served no real purpose except the pursuit of some misguided strand of official propaganda.
How else, in the end, to explain America’s useless and hugely costly entanglements in Vietnam, Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Libya, Yemen, and many other conflicts?
America’s anti-Iran animus goes back to the country’s 1979 Islamic Revolution.
For the US public, the 444-day ordeal of the US embassy staff held hostage by radical Iranian students constituted a psychological shock that has still not abated.
The hostage drama dominated the US media from start to finish, resulting in a kind of public post-traumatic stress disorder similar to the social trauma of the 9/11 attacks a generation later.
For most Americans, then and now, the hostage crisis – and indeed the Iranian Revolution itself – was a bolt out of the blue.
Few Americans realize that the Iranian Revolution came a quarter-century after the CIA and Britain’s intelligence agency MI6 conspired in 1953 to overthrow the country’s democratically elected government and install a police state under the Shah of Iran, to preserve Anglo-American control over Iran’s oil, which was threatened by nationalization.
Nor do most Americans realize that the hostage crisis was precipitated by the ill-considered decision to admit the deposed Shah into the US for medical treatment, which many Iranians viewed as a threat to the revolution.
During the Reagan Administration, the US supported Iraq in its war of aggression against Iran, including Iraq’s use of chemical weapons.
When the fighting finally ended in 1988, the US followed up with financial and trade sanctions on Iran that remain in place to this day.
Since 1953, the US has opposed Iran’s self-rule and economic development through covert action, support for authoritarian rule during 1953-79, military backing for its enemies, and decades-long sanctions.
Another reason for America’s anti-Iran animus is Iran’s support for Hezbollah and Hamas, two militant antagonists of Israel.
Here, too, it is important to understand the historical context.
In 1982, Israel invaded Lebanon in an attempt to crush militant Palestinians operating there.
In the wake of that war, and against the backdrop of anti-Muslim massacres enabled by Israel’s occupation forces, Iran supported the formation of the Shia-led Hezbollah to resist Israel’s occupation of southern Lebanon.
By the time Israel withdrew from Lebanon in 2000, nearly 20 years after its original invasion, Hezbollah had become a formidable military, political, and social force in Lebanon, and a continuing thorn in Israel’s side.
Iran also supports Hamas, a hardline Sunni group that rejects Israel’s right to exist.
Following decades of Israeli occupation of Palestinian lands captured in the 1967 war, and with peace negotiations stalemated, Hamas defeated Fatah (the Palestine Liberation Organization’s political party) at the ballot box in the 2006 election for the Palestinian parliament.
Rather than entering into a dialogue with Hamas, the US and Israel decided to try to crush it, including through a brutal war in Gaza in 2014, resulting in a massive Palestinian death toll, untold suffering, and billions of dollars in damage to homes and infrastructure in Gaza – but, predictably, leading to no political progress whatsoever.
Israel also views Iran’s nuclear program as an existential threat.
Hardline Israelis repeatedly sought to convince the US to attack Iran’s nuclear facilities, or at least allow Israel to do so.
Fortunately, President Barack Obama resisted, and instead negotiated a treaty between Iran and the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council (plus Germany) that blocks Iran’s path to nuclear weapons for a decade or more, creating space for further confidence-building measures on both sides.
Yet Trump and the Saudis seem intent on destroying the possibility of normalizing relations created by this important and promising agreement.
External powers are extremely foolish to allow themselves to be manipulated into taking sides in bitter national or sectarian conflicts that can be resolved only by compromise.
The Israel-Palestine conflict, the competition between Saudi Arabia and Iran, and the Sunni-Shia relationship all require mutual accommodation.
Yet each side in these conflicts harbors the tragic illusion of achieving an ultimate victory without the need to compromise, if only the US (or some other major power) will fight the war on its behalf.
During the past century, Britain, France, the US, and Russia have all misplayed the Middle East power game.
All have squandered lives, money, and prestige.
(Indeed, the Soviet Union was gravely, perhaps fatally, weakened by its war in Afghanistan.)
More than ever, we need an era of diplomacy that emphasizes compromise, not another round of demonization and an arms race that could all too easily spiral into disaster.
How Much Does Trump Matter?
CAMBRIDGE – The United States has never had a president like Donald Trump.
With a narcissistic personality and a short attention span, and lacking experience in world affairs, he tends to project slogans rather than strategy in foreign policy.
Some presidents, like Richard Nixon, had similar personal insecurities and social biases, but Nixon had a strategic view of foreign policy.
Others, such as Lyndon Johnson, were highly egotistical, but also had great political skill in working with Congress and other leaders.
Will future historians look back at Trump’s presidency as a temporary aberration or a major turning point in America’s role in the world?
Journalists tend to focus too heavily on leaders’ personalities, because it makes good copy.
In contrast, social scientists tend to offer broad structural theories about economic growth and geographic location that make history seem inevitable.
I once wrote a book that tried to test the importance of leaders by examining important turning points in the creation a century ago of the “American era” and speculating about what might have happened had the president’s most plausible contender been in his place instead.
Would structural forces have brought about the same era of US global leadership under different presidents?
At the beginning of the twentieth century, Theodore Roosevelt was an activist leader, but he affected mostly timing.
Economic growth and geography were the powerful determinants.
Woodrow Wilson broke with America’s hemispheric traditions by sending US forces to fight in Europe; but where Wilson made a bigger difference was in the moral tone of American exceptionalism in his justification of – and, counterproductively, his stubborn insistence on – all-or-nothing involvement in the League of Nations.
As for Franklin Roosevelt, it is at least debatable whether structural forces would have brought the US into World War II under a conservative isolationist.
Clearly, FDR’s framing of the threat posed by Hitler, and his preparation for taking advantage of an event like Pearl Harbor, were crucial factors.
The post-1945 structural bipolarity of the US and the Soviet Union set the framework for the Cold War.
But a Henry Wallace presidency (which would have occurred if FDR had not switched him for Harry Truman as vice president in 1944) might have changed the style of the US response.
Similarly, a Robert Taft or Douglas MacArthur presidency might have disrupted the relatively smooth consolidation of the containment system over which Dwight Eisenhower presided.
At the end of the century, the structural forces of global economic change caused the erosion of the Soviet superpower, and Mikhail Gorbachev’s attempts at reform accelerated the Soviet Union’s collapse.
However, Ronald Reagan’s defense buildup and negotiating savvy, along with George H.W. Bush’s skill in managing the end of the Cold War, were important to the final outcome.
Is there a plausible story in which, owing to different presidential leadership, America would not have achieved global primacy by the end of the twentieth century?
Perhaps if FDR had not been president and Germany had consolidated its power, the international system in the 1940s could have realized George Orwell’s vision of a conflict-prone multipolar world.
Perhaps if Truman had not been president and Stalin had made major gains in Europe and the Middle East, the Soviet empire would have been stronger, and bipolarity might have persisted longer.
Perhaps if Eisenhower or Bush had not been president and a different leader had been less successful in avoiding war, the American ascendency would have been driven off track (as it was for a time by US intervention in Vietnam).
Given its economic size and favorable geography, structural forces would likely have produced some form of American primacy in the twentieth century.
Nonetheless, leaders’ decisions strongly affected the timing and type of primacy.
In that sense, even when structure explains a lot, leadership within the structure can make a difference.
If history is a river whose course and flow are shaped by the large structural forces of climate and topography, human agents can be portrayed as ants clinging to a log swept along by the current, or as white-water rafters steering and avoiding rocks, occasionally overturning and sometimes succeeding.
So leadership matters, but how much?
There will never be a definitive answer.
Scholars who have tried to measure the effects of leadership in corporations or laboratory experiments have sometimes come up with numbers in the range of 10% or 15%, depending on the context.
But these are highly structured situations where change is often linear.
In unstructured situations, such as post-apartheid South Africa, the transformational leadership of Nelson Mandela made a huge difference.
American foreign policy is structured by institutions and a constitution, but external crises can create a context much more susceptible to leaders’ choices, for better or worse.
If Al Gore had been declared president in 2000, the US probably would have gone to war in Afghanistan, but not in Iraq.
Because foreign-policy events are what social scientists call “path dependent,” relatively small choices by leaders, even in the range of 10-15% early on a path, can lead to major divergences in outcomes over time.
As Robert Frost once put it, when two roads diverge in a wood, taking the one less traveled can sometimes make all the difference.
Finally, the risks created by the personality of a leader may not be symmetrical; they may make more of a difference for a mature power than for a rising power.
Striking a rock or causing a war can sink the ship.
If Trump avoids a major war, and if he is not re-elected, future scholars may look back at his presidency as a curious blip on the curve of American history.
But those are big “ifs.”
Pardons Are a Loaded Gun
NEW YORK – Joe Arpaio, the former sheriff of Maricopa County, Arizona, who was convicted of contempt of court for defying a federal judge’s order to stop racially profiling and arbitrarily detaining Latinos in the name of catching illegal immigrants, is no stranger to controversy.
But it is US President Donald Trump’s recent pardon of Arpaio that currently is spurring heated debate, as it raises fundamental questions about the presidential pardon power that has been a part of US policymaking from the country’s birth.
In a monarchy, a king may have the power to forgive citizens’ crimes virtually without limit.
In the US Constitution – Article II, Section 2 – America’s founders gave a similar power to the president, but with two key limitations.
One is rooted in separation of powers: it could not be used in cases of impeachment, an issue that is handled by Congress.
The other is rooted in federalism: it could be used only for crimes “against the United States,” or federal crimes, not crimes prosecuted by one of the 50 US states.
The granting of the pardon power reflected concerns among the US Constitution’s framers that the criminal code would be applied in a draconian manner, producing a surfeit of punishment.
As Alexander Hamilton put it in Federalist 74, “The criminal code of every country partakes so much of necessary severity, that without an easy access to exceptions in favor of unfortunate guilt, justice would wear a countenance too sanguinary and cruel.”
The power to pardon, Hamilton continued, ought to be exercised by one person, because a single person “would be most ready to attend to the force of those motives which might plead for the mitigation of the rigor of the law.”
What the founders do not address is what happens when that one person has something other than justice on his mind.
During Arpaio’s 24 years as the sheriff of a jurisdiction that includes the rapidly growing city of Phoenix, he built his reputation on his department’s aggressive efforts to track down undocumented immigrants – and on the brutal conditions he established in the facilities where they were held.
Arpaio was directly responsible for detaining thousands of people without any reasonable suspicion that they had violated immigration law.
It was enough that they looked Latino.
That behavior made Arpaio the subject of lawsuits that, from 1993 to 2015, cost $142 million to settle.
Trump and Arpaio are longtime allies.
During Barack Obama’s presidency, both were prominent figures in the racist “birther” movement that insisted Obama was born outside the US, and therefore was not entitled to be president.
During Trump’s presidential campaign, Arpaio was a poster child of the divisive immigration debate and a vocal supporter of the candidate’s extreme promises, including the construction of a wall on the border with Mexico.
Against this background, Trump’s pardon of Arpaio looks like sheer political opportunism.
It certainly was not a moral act of clemency.
After all, Arpaio’s conduct hardly qualifies as “unfortunate guilt.”
He reveled in his law-breaking, has shown no remorse for it, has never signaled an understanding of the grace of mercy.
And, given that he was not to be sentenced until October, one cannot argue that he faced draconian punishment (a key concern for America’s founders).
The US Constitution’s framers envisioned another key purpose for the pardon power: to help end conflicts and reconcile with political foes.
In Hamilton’s words, “there are often critical moments when a well-timed offer of pardon to the insurgents or rebels may restore the tranquility of the commonwealth.”
In 1863, Abraham Lincoln issued full pardons for Confederates – with the exception of their leaders and subject to conditions “he may deem expedient for the public welfare” – in order to help reunite the country after the Civil War.
Even Gerald Ford’s 1974 pardon of Richard Nixon, who had resigned from the presidency over the Watergate scandal, was couched in terms of national healing.
Recalling the ways in which the pardon power has been used in the past highlights the perversity of the Arpaio affair and its singular reactionary purpose: to denigrate and, where possible, reverse Obama’s achievements and, indeed, his values.
In Trump’s hands, a constitutional power intended to mitigate the “necessary severity” of criminal justice was deployed to sanction cruelty by a sworn officer of the law.
Unsurprisingly, given its purely ideological basis, Arpaio’s pardon was not reviewed in advance by the US Department of Justice, as has become customary over the years.
Indeed, the DOJ rushed to distance itself from the decision, highlighting how easily Trump can use (or not use) the pardon power to settle his many scores: it is virtually the only power within the criminal justice system that the president can exercise unilaterally.
To be sure, Trump’s pardon of Arpaio has not created a legal basis for impunity; the pardon power’s constitutional limitations prevent that.
But a serious problem will arise if Trump attempts to use it to protect his family – not a farfetched scenario, given pending FBI investigations into his inner circle’s dealings with Russia.
Such a move would be met with a potential legal challenge, based on the impeachment clause or other constitutional limits.
The pardon power is like a loaded gun.
In the hands of a leader who possesses wisdom and good character, it can strengthen the rule of law.
But, in the hands of an unstable, vengeful narcissist, it can cause profound damage.
Preparing Asia for Trump
CANBERRA – Whether or not US President-elect Donald Trump behaves better once in office than he did on the campaign trail, America’s global authority has already taken a battering, not least among its allies and partners in Asia.
Exercising soft power – leading by democratic and moral example – will not be easy for Trump, given the disdain he showed for truth, rational argument, basic human decency, and racial, religious, and gender differences, not to mention the fact that he was not actually elected by a majority of voters.
And when it comes to exercising harder power – doing what it takes to counter serious challenges to peace and security – there will be little confidence in Trump’s judgment, given that almost every statement he made during his campaign was either wildly contradictory or downright alarming.
Maintaining security, stability, and prosperity in Asia requires a cooperative environment, in which countries secure their national interests through partnerships – not rivalries – and trade freely with one another.
The only grounds for confidence on this front after Trump’s victory is that he may actually do none of the things he said he would, such as starting a trade war with China, walking away from alliance commitments, and supporting Japan and South Korea going nuclear.
With little or no hard knowledge of international affairs, Trump is relying on instincts that are all over the map.
He combines “America first” isolationist rhetoric with muscular talk of “making America great again.”
Staking out impossibly extreme positions that you can readily abandon may work in negotiating property deals; but it is not a sound basis for conducting foreign policy.
Trump’s dangerous instincts may be bridled if he is capable of assembling an experienced and sophisticated team of foreign-policy advisers.
But this remains to be seen, and the US Constitution grants him extraordinary personal power as Commander-in-Chief, if he chooses to exercise it.
US leadership in Asia is a double-edged sword.
Noisy assertions of continued primacy are counterproductive.
China’s legitimate demand to be accepted as a joint rule-maker, not just a rule-follower, has to be recognized.
But when China overreaches, as it has done with its territorial assertions in the South China Sea, there does need to be pushback.
On that front, a quiet but firm US role remains necessary and welcome.
Shortly after former President Bill Clinton left office, I heard him say privately (though never publicly) that the US could choose to use its “great and unrivaled economic and military power to try to stay top dog on the global block in perpetuity.”
A better choice, however, would be “to try to create a world in which we will be comfortable living, when we are no longer top dog on the global block.”
That kind of language seems to be anathema for anyone holding high office in the US, at least publicly.
But it is what Asia wants to hear.
For Australia and other US allies and partners in the region, this presidential election makes it clear that we can no longer – assuming we ever could – take coherent, smart American leadership for granted.
We must do more for ourselves and work together more, while relying less on the US.
Trump will probably have more instinctive sympathy for Australia than he will for many other US allies.
We are seen as paying our alliance dues, not least by having fought alongside the US in every one of its foreign wars – for better or worse – over the past century.
And, as cohabitants in the Anglosphere, we are in Trump’s cultural comfort zone.
But Australia will be anything but comfortable if the larger regional dynamics go off the rails.
We should have learned by now that the US, under administrations with far more prima facie credibility than Trump’s, is perfectly capable of making terrible mistakes, such as the wars in Vietnam and Iraq.
We now have to be ready for American blunders as bad as, or worse than, in the past.
We will have to make our own judgments about how to react to events, based on our own national interests.
This does not mean that Australia should walk away from its alliance with the US.
But we will need to be more skeptical of American policies and actions than in recent decades.
Australia should become much more self-consciously independent, and assign much higher priority to building closer trade and security ties with Japan, South Korea, India, and especially Indonesia, our huge near-neighbor.
No one should give ground if China overreaches, and Australia should, now more than ever, work closely with our Asian neighbors to ensure that it does not.
But we must also recognize the legitimacy of China’s new great-power aspirations, and engage with it non-confrontationally.
We will all benefit from a common regional-security framework based on mutual respect and reciprocity, not least when confronting regional threats such as North Korea’s nuclear chest-beating.
We can only hope that Trump will dispel our worst fears when he is in office.
But in the meantime, Australian and other regional policymakers should adhere to a simple mantra: More self-reliance.
More Asia.
Less US.
Mr. Trump Goes to China
NEW YORK – US President Donald Trump is spending nearly two weeks in Asia, visiting Japan, South Korea, China, Vietnam, and the Philippines.
Putting China at the center of the trip makes sense, because it constitutes the most important stop in both strategic and economic terms.
North Korea will dominate much of the conversation when Trump is in China, in large part because he is counting on Chinese leaders to solve the North Korea problem for the United States.
This approach is understandable, because the bulk of North Korea’s trade transits Chinese territory, and China could exert enormous pressure on the North if it so chose.
But Trump will likely come away disappointed.
China will resist deploying its full leverage, lest it undermine North Korea’s stability and end up worse off as a result.
The irony and potential tragedy of China’s position is that allowing North Korea to increase and improve its nuclear and missile arsenals could fuel momentum toward war, or lead South Korea, Japan, or both to reconsider their non-nuclear postures.
Any of these outcomes would be inconsistent with Chinese strategic interests; but, like many governments, China’s leaders will seek to avoid difficult decisions in the short run, even if this results in damaging outcomes over time.
The North Korea problem is but one of many on the Sino-US agenda, which includes other geopolitical matters (most notably, the situation in the South China Sea and the status of Taiwan).
There are also economic issues that need to be addressed, such as China’s failure to respect intellectual property, its large government subsidies to export-oriented firms, its restriction of access to its market, and its efforts to require foreign firms doing business in China to transfer advanced technology to Chinese firms.
The list of issues dividing these two important and powerful countries is thus long and difficult, reinforcing the pessimism of those who predict that the bilateral relationship will continue to sour.
One of the arguments that the pessimists marshal is the historical pattern whereby rising and established powers tend to end up competing with one another, or even fighting.
One recent book, by the Harvard political scientist Graham Allison, focuses on the so-called “Thucydides Trap,” named for the ancient Greek historian who chronicled the competitive relationship that ultimately produced the Peloponnesian War between a rising Athens and Sparta, the superpower of its day.
Allison portrays China and the US in these roles, and calls his book Destined for War.
Such predictions are unwarranted.
They discount the dampening effect of nuclear weapons, which for more than four decades helped keep the Cold War between the US and the Soviet Union from turning hot.
They also overlook the ability of the US and China to finesse their disagreement over Taiwan.
Diplomacy can and will matter; little is inevitable in international relations.
Indeed, the US and China have managed to keep their ties on a relatively even keel, despite the disappearance of the original rationale for their relationship – shared antipathy toward the Soviet Union – when the Cold War ended a quarter-century ago.
The extensive economic relationship that has evolved since then has given both countries a stake in maintaining good relations.
And, given China’s need for external stability to pursue economic development, its leaders have acted with considerable restraint.
Still, the pessimists’ concerns cannot be dismissed.
After all, countries often fail to act in their own self-interest, or events simply spin out of control.
For example, Chinese leaders may be tempted to act more assertively to placate public opinion amid a slowing economy, and to take advantage of opportunities created by a US that has retreated from regional trade accords.
The stakes are high, as the history of the twenty-first century will be affected in no small part by the character of the Sino-American relationship.
Trump, who vacillates between tough criticism of China over trade and encomiums to President Xi Jinping, will have to balance pressing his legitimate concerns over trade with the need to avoid starting a trade war.
And Xi will have to judge what he can give to satisfy his American visitor without jeopardizing his or the Party’s standing in the eyes of the Chinese people.
North Korea, though, will be the biggest test.
Trump and Xi must find a way to defuse the looming crisis on the Korean Peninsula – or manage the consequences should diplomacy fail and war erupt.
In the latter scenario, it would be essential that a second Korean War not lead to direct US-Chinese combat, as the first one did.
And cooperation would be essential to maintain control over North Korea’s nuclear materials.
All of this will require deft diplomacy.
Trump and Xi, one sincerely hopes, will soon be laying the groundwork for it.
Trump’s Opportunity in Asia
WASHINGTON, DC – A year after his election, US President Donald Trump is making his first official visit to Asia.
The 12-day tour of five countries – Trump’s longest foreign trip so far – will, according to official briefings, focus on easing doubts about the reliability of the United States and its leader.
Given the challenges and possibilities for the US in Asia, that is an unambitious goal.
Trump will start his trip by reinforcing America’s alliances with Japan and South Korea – alliances that he previously discounted and belittled, particularly during his campaign.
The aim is to buttress his demand, which he will reiterate when he reaches Beijing, that China follow through on its pledges in the United Nations Security Council to tighten sanctions on North Korea.
Next, Trump will head to Vietnam and the Philippines.
Close relations with both are necessary to underpin ongoing US efforts to challenge China’s growing influence in Southeast Asia.
President Barack Obama’s administration had mixed results in competing for influence with China.
Trump administration officials have lately hinted that the US may, at some point, devise a new strategy for the entire Indo-Pacific region.
Beyond foreign policy, Trump’s Asian tour should also advance some economic objectives.
A large group of US corporate leaders will accompany Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross to China, where they will seek to strike deals, promote open markets, and address abuses in bilateral trade.
Chinese officials, for their part, have indicated that they will announce new agreements and consider opening parts of the Chinese market that are now closed to outsiders.
So far, so good.
But so far is not far enough.
Talks with officials around the region reveal that America’s friends and allies have not received the sort of advance briefings that are normally used to prepare the ground for important new policies and undertakings.
More fundamentally, briefings and statements in the run-up to the trip have shown no regard for major political and strategic trends that are now converging – trends that must inform any comprehensive US policy toward Asia.
The first such trend is the decline of the US-led unipolar world order that has prevailed since the end of the Cold War, and the reemergence of great power rivalries.
China, Russia, Europe, and the Middle East are all headed in new directions, and America no longer has the capacity it once did to influence them.
The Trump administration needs to abandon its complacency and pursue competitive coalition-building.
Doing so will require Trump’s confident assertion of the benefits of the US-led liberal international order, which China and Russia are now challenging.
It will also demand that Trump display leadership in forging international cooperation, particularly on trade.
Just as Trump has walked back his denigration of America’s European and Asian allies, he should stifle his inclination for protectionism and unilateral action.
Politically, Trump stands to gain much more by leading the way toward a new multilateral free-trade agreement than he would by pursuing isolationism and allowing China to assume trade leadership in Asia.
And Trump has a golden opportunity to do so.
Though he pulled the US out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership early in his term, the remaining 11 partners are moving to sustain most of the agreement.
Why not get back in front of the parade and demonstrate a capacity for leadership in changing times?
Meanwhile, the Trump administration needs to be more ambitious in pressing China for greater reciprocity in market access and competition.
Earlier this year, Trump praised China for making promises on this front, even though it had already made – and broken – the same promises to the Obama administration.
The US wants access to financial-services markets in China, but appears willing to settle, at least for now, for openings in credit research services and, possibly, credit-card marketing.
Meanwhile, China leads the world in disruptive financial technologies (fintech), with payments by mobile phone replacing credit cards.
The second major trend that should be informing the Trump administration’s Asia policy is Chinese President Xi Jinping’s consolidation of power.
By not designating a successor to Xi, the Communist Party of China’s recent 19th National Congress has opened the way for him to serve a third term.
With so much political capital, Xi now has the scope to adjust his stance on domestically sensitive issues, according to China’s longer-term interests and his own.
China’s recent agreement to normalize relations with South Korea, after more than a year of acrimony, may reflect the effect of Xi’s liberation from succession politics.
Prior to the 19th National Congress, China insisted on punishing South Korea for allowing the US to deploy its Terminal High Altitude Area Defense antimissile system on its territory.
But this approach brought China no benefits; on the contrary, it damaged China’s reputation in South Korea.
Now, China is backing off.
Trump should seize this moment to secure greater cooperation from China in tackling, along with South Korea, the North Korean threat.
China is not in a position to shut down North Korea’s nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs.
But it can cooperate with the US to narrow the North’s choices and reduce the potential for a conflagration on the Korean Peninsula, such as through covert cooperation and official contingency planning for the future of North Korea.
When Trump meets Xi in Beijing, he should offer a path toward just such a strategic compromise.
As it stands, it seems that Trump is hoping to impress critics with headlines about what are actually small-bore accomplishments.
But there are historic opportunities ahead.
Trump’s Asia trip is the ideal moment to begin to seize them.
Trump’s Virtual Wall
CAMBRIDGE – In many ways, the Republican Party’s plan to implement a “border adjustment tax” in the United States is the virtual complement of the physical wall President Donald Trump plans to erect on the US-Mexican border.
Although the border adjustment tax has not seeped into public consciousness in nearly the same way as Trump’s physical wall has, it could end up affecting the average American a lot more – and not necessarily in a good way.
On the surface, the basic idea is to slap a tax of, say, 20% on imports, and to provide tax breaks worth a similar amount on exports.
Most populists’ gut reaction is that this must be fantastic for US jobs, because it discourages imports and encourages exports.
Unfortunately, as many have pointed out, there is a loose screw in this logic, which is that the United States has a floating exchange rate.
A stronger dollar – a likely result of imposing a border adjustment tax – makes it cheaper for Americans to buy imports (because a dollar buys more foreign currency); conversely, a stronger dollar makes US exports more expensive to foreigners.
In fact, the baseline textbook result is that the exchange-rate effect would fully offset the tax, leaving the trade balance unchanged.
If you think the Republicans’ proposal sounds like hocus pocus, you might be right, but let’s hold that thought.
Several highly regarded academic economists favor the border adjustment idea, but for entirely different reasons.
They take it as an article of faith that the exchange rate will in fact rise to neutralize the trade effects of a border adjustment tax.
But they like it anyway.
First, the US imports a lot more than it exports, so it runs a large trade deficit, with the broadest measure (the “current account”) at around 2.5% of GDP.
While that is a vast improvement over the 6%-of-GDP deficits the US was running a decade ago, the US still imports considerably more than it exports, meaning the government stands to collect far more revenues from its 20% tax on imports than it would have to give in tax breaks to exporters.
Indeed, the tax-subsidy schedule could, on paper at least, bring in roughly $90 billion a year.
And the magic doesn’t stop there.
Although it might surprise people who are used to thinking of imports and exports as a pure “us versus them” phenomenon, in fact roughly half of all trade is intra-firm – transactions between foreign and US divisions of the same company.
And because US corporate taxes are among the world’s highest, firms will go to great lengths to assign as much value as they can to foreign subsidiaries, and as little as possible to US companies.
One way to do this is by putting an artificially high bookkeeping price on intra-firm imports, and an artificially low bookkeeping price on exports.
Under- and over-invoicing is a time-honored way to get around taxes and controls.
When a transaction is all “in-house,” it essentially just involves accounting sleight of hand to book profits in low tax jurisdictions.
As the University of California at Berkeley’s Alan Auerbach first pointed out, the border tax adjustment is a way to push back on under- and over-invoicing in a high-tax jurisdiction such as the US.
So, all in all, even if a border adjustment tax does not directly make US goods more competitive, it is an efficient way to raise revenues, potentially making room for other tax cuts.
So what could possibly be wrong with such a technocratically sound idea?
First, it relies on some heroic assumptions – for example, that people cannot easily game the labyrinthine system and that foreign governments will exercise restraint in retaliating.
Second, it ignores a host of difficult transition problems.
For starters, the overwhelming majority of US imports are priced in dollars, not foreign currency.
So, even if foreign currencies become cheaper, it might not help importers locked into dollar contracts. Their costs would just be 20% higher because of the import tax.
And, despite the tax subsidy, some exporters would lose, because, as a recent New York Federal Reserve note points out, they rely on imported intermediate goods in producing their products.
Another problem is that a stronger dollar would mean a massive wealth loss for Americans, because the value of many foreign assets would go down, as my colleagues Emmanuel Farhi, Gita Gopinath, and Oleg Itskhoki have discussed.
The biggest problem of all, though, is the blithe assumption that the dollar exchange rate would neatly move to offset the tax/subsidy scheme.
If there is anything that the past 40 years of exchange-rate research have taught us, it is that exchange rates can move wildly away from their fundamentals for many years at a time.
It is thoroughly unrealistic to assume that a border tax will quickly lead to a sharp offsetting movement of the dollar.
The process could take many years, and the short-term effects on US unemployment easily could be negative.
True, high border taxes could boost US employment.
The scheme would require a huge increase in customs agents, and it would most likely lead to significant expansion in the underground economy as people seek to evade the taxes.
But are those really the types of jobs proponents of a border tax have in mind?
The Trump Boom?
CAMBRIDGE – After years of hibernation, will the US economy rouse itself for a big comeback over the next couple of years?
With an incoming Republican administration hell-bent on reflating an economy already near full employment, and with promised trade restrictions driving up the price of import-competing goods, and with central-bank independence likely to come under attack, higher inflation – likely exceeding 3% at times – is a near-certainty.
And output growth could surprise as well, possibly reaching 4%, at least temporarily.
Impossible you say?
Not at all.
The economy already seems to be growing at a 3% annual clip.
And even steadfast opponents of President-elect Trump’s economic policies would have to admit they are staunchly pro-business (with the notable exception of trade).
Consider regulation.
Under President Barack Obama, labor regulation expanded significantly, not to mention the dramatic increase in environmental legislation.
And that is not even counting the huge shadow Obamacare casts on the health-care system, which alone accounts for 17% of the economy.
I am certainly not saying that repealing Obama-era regulation will improve the average American’s wellbeing.
Far from it.
But businesses will be ecstatic, maybe enough to start really investing again.
The boost to confidence is already palpable.
Then there is the prospect of a massive stimulus, featuring a huge expansion of badly needed infrastructure spending.
(Trump will presumably bulldoze Congressional opposition to higher deficits.)
Ever since the 2008 financial crisis, economists across the political spectrum have argued for taking advantage of ultra-low interest rates to finance productive infrastructure investment, even at the cost of higher debt.
High-return projects pay for themselves.
Far more controversial is Trump’s plan for a massive across-the-board income-tax cut that disproportionately benefits the rich.
True, putting cash in the pockets of rich savers hardly seems as effective as giving cash to poor people who live hand to mouth.
Trump’s opponent, Hillary Clinton, memorably spoke of “Trumped-up trickle-down economics.”
But, Trumped-up or not, tax cuts can be very good for business confidence.
It is hard to know just how much extra debt Trump’s stimulus program will add, but estimates of $5 trillion over ten years – a 25% increase – seem sober.
Many left-wing economics commentators, having insisted for eight years under Obama that there is never any risk to US borrowing, now warn that greater borrowing by the Trump administration will pave the road to financial Armageddon.
Their hypocrisy is breathtaking, even if they are now closer to being right.
Exactly how much Trump’s policies will raise output and inflation is hard to know.
The closer the US economy is to full capacity, the more inflation there will be.
If US productivity really has collapsed as much as many scholars believe, additional stimulus is likely to raise prices a lot more than output; demand will not induce new supply.
On the other hand, if the US economy really does have massive quantities of underutilized and unemployed resources, the effect of Trump’s policies on growth could be considerable.
In Keynesian jargon, there is still a large multiplier on fiscal policy.
It is easy to forget the biggest missing piece of the global recovery is business investment, and if it starts kicking in finally, both output and productivity could begin to rise very sharply.
Those who are deeply wedded to the idea of “secular stagnation” would say high growth under Trump is well-nigh impossible.
But if one believes, as I do, that the slow growth of the last eight years was mainly due to the overhang of debt and fear from the 2008 crisis, then it is not so hard to believe that normalization could be much closer than we realize.
After all, so far virtually every financial crisis has eventually come to an end.
Of course, all of this is an optimistic spin on a Trump economy.
If the new administration proves erratic and incompetent (a real possibility), dejection will quickly overwhelm confidence.
But beware of pundits who are certain that Trump will bring economic catastrophe.
On election eve, New York Times columnist Paul Krugman unequivocally insisted that a Trump victory would lead to a stock-market collapse, with no recovery in sight.
Investors who relied on his insights lost a lot of money.
At the risk of hyperbole, it’s wise to remember that you don’t have to be a nice guy to get the economy going.
In many ways, Germany was as successful as America at using stimulus to lift the economy out of the Great Depression.
Yes, it still could all end very badly.
The world is a risky place.
If global growth collapses, US growth could suffer severely.
Still, it is far more likely that after years of slow recovery, the US economy might at last be ready to move significantly faster, at least for a while.
The Demise of Dollar Diplomacy?
WASHINGTON, DC – Mark Twain never actually said “Reports of my death have been greatly exaggerated.”
But the misquote is too delicious to die a natural death of its own.
And nowhere is the idea behind it more relevant than in discussions of the dollar’s international role.
Pundits have been saying last rites for the dollar’s global dominance since the 1960s – that is, for more than a half-century now.
The point can be shown by occurrences of the phrase “demise of the dollar” in all English-language publications catalogued by Google.
The frequency of such mentions, adjusted for the number of printed pages per year, first jumped in 1969, following the collapse of the London Gold Pool, an arrangement in which eight central banks cooperated to support the dollar’s peg to gold.
Use of the phrase soared in the 1970s, following the collapse of the Bretton Woods system, of which the dollar was the linchpin, and in response to the high inflation that accompanied the presidencies of Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, and Jimmy Carter in the 1970s.
But even that spike was dwarfed by the increase in mentions and corresponding worries about the dollar starting in 2001, reflecting the shock of the terrorist attacks that September, the mushrooming growth of the US trade deficit, and then the global financial crisis of 2008.
Yet through all of this, the dollar’s international role has endured.
As my coauthors and I show in a new book, the share of dollars in the foreign-currency reserves held by central banks and governments worldwide hardly budged in the face of these events.
The greenback remains the dominant currency traded in foreign-exchange markets.
It is still the unit in which petroleum is priced and traded worldwide, Venezuelan leaders’ complaints about the “tyranny of the dollar” notwithstanding.
To the consternation of many currency traders, the value of the dollar fluctuates widely, as its rise, fall, and recovery in the course of the last year have shown.
But this does little to erode the attractiveness of the dollar in international markets.
Central banks still hold US Treasury bonds because the market for them is the single most liquid financial market in the world.
And Treasury bonds are secure: the federal government has not fallen into arrears on its debt since the disastrous War of 1812.
In addition, US diplomatic and military links encourage America’s allies to hold dollars.
States with their own nuclear weapons hold fewer dollars than countries that depend on the US for their security needs.
Being in a military alliance with a reserve-currency-issuing country boosts the share of the partner’s foreign-exchange reserves held in that currency by roughly 30 percentage points.
The evidence thus suggests that the share of reserves held in dollars would fall appreciably in the absence of this effect.
This under-appreciated link between geopolitical alliances and international currency choice reflects a combination of factors.
Governments have reason to be confident that the reserve-currency country will make servicing debt held by its allies a high priority.
In return, those allies, by holding its liabilities, can help to lower the issuer’s borrowing costs.
Here, then, and not in another imbroglio over the federal debt ceiling this coming December, is where the real threat to the dollar’s international dominance lies.
As one anonymous US State Department official put it, President Donald Trump “does not seem to care about alliances and therefore does not care about diplomacy.”
South Korea and Japan are thought to hold about 80% of their international reserves in dollars.
One can imagine that the financial behavior of these and other countries would change dramatically, with adverse implications for the dollar’s exchange rate and US borrowing costs, were America’s close military alliances with its allies to fray.
Nor is it hard to imagine how this fraying could come about.
President Donald Trump has painted himself into a strategic corner: he needs a concession from North Korea on the nuclear-weapons issue in order to save face with his base, not to mention with the global community.
And, for all of Trump’s aggressive rhetoric and posturing, the only feasible way to secure such a concession is through negotiation.
Ironically, the most plausible outcome of that process is an inspections regime not unlike the one negotiated by Barack Obama’s administration with Iran.
To get there, Trump’s administration will have to offer something in return.
The most obvious bargaining chip that could be offered to make the North Korean regime feel more secure is a reduction in US troop levels on the Korean Peninsula and in Asia in general, With that, the US security guarantee for Asia will weaken, in turn providing China an opportunity to step into the geopolitical breach.
And where China leads geopolitically, its currency, the renminbi, is likely to follow.
The Kindleberger Trap
CAMBRIDGE – As US President-elect Donald Trump prepares his administration’s policy toward China, he should be wary of two major traps that history has set for him.
The “Thucydides Trap,” cited by Chinese President Xi Jinping, refers to the warning by the ancient Greek historian that cataclysmic war can erupt if an established power (like the United States) becomes too fearful of a rising power (like China).
But Trump also has to worry about the “Kindleberger Trap”: a China that seems too weak rather than too strong.
Charles Kindleberger, an intellectual architect of the Marshall Plan who later taught at MIT, argued that the disastrous decade of the 1930s was caused when the US replaced Britain as the largest global power but failed to take on Britain’s role in providing global public goods.
The result was the collapse of the global system into depression, genocide, and world war.
Today, as China’s power grows, will it help provide global public goods?
In domestic politics, governments produce public goods such as policing or a clean environment, from which all citizens can benefit and none are excluded.
At the global level, public goods – such as a stable climate, financial stability, or freedom of the seas – are provided by coalitions led by the largest powers.
Small countries have little incentive to pay for such global public goods.
Because their small contributions make little difference to whether they benefit or not, it is rational for them to ride for free.
But the largest powers can see the effect and feel the benefit of their contributions.
So it is rational for the largest countries to lead.
When they do not, global public goods are under-produced.
When Britain became too weak to play that role after World War I, an isolationist US continued to be a free rider, with disastrous results.
Some observers worry that as China’s power grows, it will free ride rather than contribute to an international order that it did not create.
So far, the record is mixed.
China benefits from the United Nations system, where it has a veto in the Security Council.
It is now the second-largest funder of UN peacekeeping forces, and it participated in UN programs related to Ebola and climate change.
China has also benefited greatly from multilateral economic institutions like the World Trade Organization, the World Bank, and the International Monetary Fund.
In 2015, China launched the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, which some saw as an alternative to the World Bank; but the new institution adheres to international rules and cooperates with the World Bank.
On the other hand, China’s rejection of a Permanent Court of Arbitration judgment last year against its territorial claims in the South China Sea raises troublesome questions.
Thus far, however, Chinese behavior has sought not to overthrow the liberal world order from which it benefits, but to increase its influence within it.
If pressed and isolated by Trump’s policy, however, will China become a disruptive free rider that pushes the world into a Kindleberger Trap?
Trump must also worry about the better-known Thucydides Trap: a China that seems too strong rather than too weak.
There is nothing inevitable about this trap, and its effects are often exaggerated.
For example, the political scientist Graham Allison has argued that in 12 of 16 cases since 1500 when an established power has confronted a rising power, the result has been a major war.
But these numbers are not accurate, because it is not clear what constitutes a “case.”
For example, Britain was the dominant world power in the mid-nineteenth century, but it let Prussia create a powerful new German empire in the heart of the European continent.
Of course, Britain did fight Germany a half-century later, in 1914, but should that be counted as one case or two?
World War I was not simply a case of an established Britain responding to a rising Germany.
In addition to the rise of Germany, WWI was caused by the fear in Germany of Russia’s growing power, the fear of rising Slavic nationalism in a declining Austria-Hungary, as well as myriad other factors that differed from ancient Greece.
As for current analogies, today’s power gap between the US and China is much greater than that between Germany and Britain in 1914.
Metaphors can be useful as general precautions, but they become dangerous when they convey a sense of historical inexorableness.
Even the classical Greek case is not as straightforward as Thucydides made it seem.
He claimed that the cause of the second Peloponnesian War was the growth of the power of Athens and the fear it caused in Sparta.
But the Yale historian Donald Kagan has shown that Athenian power was in fact not growing.
Before the war broke out in 431 BC, the balance of power had begun to stabilize.
Athenian policy mistakes made the Spartans think that war might be worth the risk.
Athens’ growth caused the first Peloponnesian War earlier in the century, but then a Thirty-Year Truce doused the fire.
Kagan argues that to start the second, disastrous war, a spark needed to land on one of the rare bits of kindling that had not been thoroughly drenched and then continually and vigorously fanned by poor policy choices.
In other words, the war was caused not by impersonal forces, but by bad decisions in difficult circumstances.
That is the danger that Trump confronts with China today.
He must worry about a China that is simultaneously too weak and too strong.
To achieve his objectives, he must avoid the Kindleberger trap as well as the Thucydides trap.
But, above all, he must avoid the miscalculations, misperceptions, and rash judgments that plague human history.
A Bull Named Trump in a Shop Called China
CAMBRIDGE – Some of US President-elect Donald Trump’s nastiest attacks have been directed at China.
He has accused it of “raping” the United States with its trade policies, and of creating global warming as a “hoax” to undermine US competitiveness.
Why, then, are many Chinese policy advisers and commentators sanguine about future US-China relations?
The reasoning seems to be that Trump is a businessman, and, to paraphrase US President Calvin Coolidge, the business of China is business.
China, the thinking goes, can work with a swashbuckling deal-maker like Trump better than with a supposedly “ideological” Hillary Clinton.
Many people would be surprised to see Clinton categorized as an ideologue.
And there is scant evidence to support the claim that businesspeople somehow embody pragmatism, given that so many powerful US business leaders are committed ideologues.
The Koch brothers, for example, stubbornly cling to impractical and thoroughly debunked libertarian ideas, and numerous Fortune 500 CEOs instinctively side with Republicans, even though the US economy consistently performs better under Democratic administrations.
And one should not forget Andrew William Mellon’s infamous and reckless advice to former US President Herbert Hoover on the eve of the Great Depression: “liquidate labor, liquidate stocks, liquidate farmers, liquidate real estate.”
The revelation that Trump and President Tsai Ing-wen of Taiwan spoke by telephone has probably now shattered any residual hope that the incoming US administration will be anything but a bull in a China shop.
That phone call violated a protocol – avoidance of direct contact between the US and Taiwan at the presidential level – that American presidents from both parties have carefully observed for four decades.
Trump’s diplomatic breach sent shock waves across Asia, which he then aggravated by asking, in a series of tweets, if China consulted with the US before devaluing its currency or building a massive military base in the South China Sea.
But by calling into question the “One China” policy, Trump is playing with fire.
Careful and deft management by both Republican and Democratic administrations has helped maintain the fragile peace between China and Taiwan.
For the US, the primary objective is to maintain the status quo, by dissuading Taiwan from actively seeking independence and discouraging China from forcing Taiwan into a speedy reunification.
In another tweet, Trump asked why he shouldn’t engage with Taiwan at the presidential level when the US is selling Taiwan billions of dollars worth of weapons.
Feigned or not, such bafflement from the American president-elect is truly worrying.
The US sells Taiwan military equipment mostly for self-defense, and as a signal to China that the US will not stand idly by in the event of Chinese military action against the island.
But the US deliberately attenuates this message by refusing to engage with Taiwan at the highest levels, which is meant to disabuse Taiwan of the notion that it can count on American support if the island ever actually declares independence.
For more than 40 years, this doctrine of “strategic ambiguity” has worked brilliantly.
Peace has survived multiple leadership changes on both sides of the Taiwan Strait.
And trade and investment between Taiwan and mainland China have flourished.
A break with long-established policy by Trump would be damaging in many ways.
For starters, he could embolden Taiwan to be more aggressive in trying to upend the status quo.
Indeed, Tsai’s own Democratic Progressive Party is officially committed to Taiwan’s independence, and while Tsai herself has not yet sought to realize revisionist goals, that could change if she feels that Trump is sympathetic to her cause.
Trump could also do damage by inflaming Chinese government and military hardliners, if he confirms their belief that the US wants to undermine their country’s “core interests” – namely, sustaining the appearance, if not the reality, that there is only one China.
The Chinese foreign ministry initially voiced mild criticism of Trump’s call with Tsai, but People’s Daily, the Chinese Communist Party’s house organ, has since issued a far stronger rebuke, warning that “creating troubles for the China-US relationship is creating troubles for the US itself.”
Soon after, the Chinese Navy temporarily seized an American submersible drone in international waters.
China is clearly signaling its agitation.
There is no method to Trump’s madness.
In the same tweet justifying his phone call with Tsai, he repeated a false charge that China is devaluing its currency to gain export advantages vis-à-vis the US.
His knowledge of international economics is either non-existent or ten years out of date.
In reality, China is now hemorrhaging foreign-exchange reserves and desperately trying to prop up the renminbi’s value in the face of capital flight.
Trump is apparently antagonizing China for no good reason.
Worse, by announcing that the US will withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership – designed, at least in part, to shape global trade and investment flows according to Western rules, rather than China’s mercantilist vision – Trump is also abandoning a US policy that could have checked China’s surging influence in Asia.
Since Trump’s TPP announcement, many Asian countries have now pledged to join a regional trade bloc spearheaded by China.
With Trump’s help, the “Chinese Century” may arrive sooner than anyone expected.
By moving closer to Taiwan, attacking China on phantom grounds, and dismantling the TPP, Trump is provoking China while simultaneously empowering and enabling it.
This is not the art of the deal.
It’s the road to disaster.
America and China’s Codependency Trap
NEW HAVEN – Seemingly at odds with the world, US President Donald Trump has once again raised the possibility of a trade conflict with China.
On August 14, he instructed the US Trade Representative to commence investigating Chinese infringement of intellectual property rights.
By framing this effort under Section 301 of the US Trade Act of 1974, the Trump administration could impose high and widespread tariffs on Chinese imports.
This is hardly an inconsequential development.
While there may well be merit to the allegations, as documented in the latest “USTR Report to Congress on China’s WTO Compliance,” punitive action would have serious consequences for US businesses and consumers.
Like it or not, that is an inevitable result of the deeply entrenched codependent relationship between the world’s two largest economies.
In a codependent human relationship, when one party alters the terms of engagement, the other feels scorned and invariably responds in kind. The same can be expected of economies and their leaders.
That means in a trade conflict, it is important to think about reciprocity – specifically, China’s response to an American action.
In fact, that was precisely the point made by China’s Ministry of Commerce in its official response to Trump’s gambit.
China, the ministry vowed, would “take all appropriate measures to resolutely safeguard its legitimate rights.”
Caught up in the bluster of the US accusations being leveled at China, little attention is being paid to the potential consequences of Chinese retaliation.
Three economic consequences stand out.
First, imposing tariffs on imports of Chinese goods and services would be the functional equivalent of a tax hike on American consumers.
Chinese producers’ unit labor costs are less than one fifth those of America’s other major foreign suppliers. By diverting US demand away from Chinese trade, the costs of imported goods would undoubtedly rise sharply.
The possibility of higher import prices and potential spillover effects on underlying inflation would hit middle-class US workers, who have faced more than three decades of real wage stagnation, especially hard.
Second, trade actions against China could lead to higher US interest rates.
Foreigners currently own about 30% of all US Treasury securities, with the latest official data putting Chinese ownership at $1.15 trillion in June 2017 – fully 19% of total foreign holdings and slightly higher than Japan’s $1.09 trillion.
In the event of new US tariffs, it seems reasonable to expect China to respond by reducing such purchases, reinforcing a strategy of asset diversification away from US dollar-based assets that has been under way for the past three years.
In an era of still-large US budget deficits – likely to go even higher in the aftermath of Trump administration tax cuts and spending initiatives – the lack of demand for Treasuries by the largest foreign owner could well put upward pressure on borrowing costs.
Third, with growth in US domestic demand still depressed, American companies need to rely more on external demand.
Yet the Trump administration seems all but oblivious to this component of the growth calculus.
It is threatening trade sanctions not only against China – America’s third-largest and fastest-growing major export market – but also against NAFTA partners Canada and Mexico (America’s largest and second-largest export markets, respectively).
As the reactive pathology of codependency would suggest, none of these countries can be expected to acquiesce to such measures without curtailing US access to their markets – a counter-response that could severely undermine the manufacturing revival that seems so central to the Trump presidency’s promise to “Make America Great Again.”
In the end, China’s economic leverage over America is largely the result of low US domestic saving.
In the first quarter of 2017, the so-called net national saving rate – the combined depreciation-adjusted saving of businesses, households, and the government sector – stood at just 1.9% of national income, well below the longer-term average of 6.3% that prevailed over the final three decades of the twentieth century.
Lacking in saving and wanting to consume and grow, the US must import surplus saving from abroad to close the gap, forcing it to run massive current-account and trade deficits with countries like China to attract the foreign capital.
It is sheer political chicanery to single out China, America’s NAFTA partners, or even Germany as the culprit in a saving-short US economy.
Fostering policies that encourage an economy to squander its saving and live beyond its means makes trade deficits a given – as are the seemingly unfair trading practices that may come with this Faustian bargain for foreign capital.
The US ran trade deficits with 101 countries in 2016 – a multilateral external imbalance rooted in America’s chronic domestic saving problem.
The fix for this problem cannot be made in China.
Ironically, with the Trump administration’s policies likely to lead to larger budget deficits that put national saving under additional downward pressure, the need for Chinese and other foreign capital will actually intensify and the codependency trap will only close more tightly.
America does not hold the trump card in its economic relationship with China.
The Trump administration can certainly put pressure on China, and, on one level, there may well be good reason to do so.
But deep questions concerning the consequences of such pressure have been all but ignored.
Getting tough on China while ignoring those consequences could be a blunder of epic proportions.
Can Trump Deal with North Korea and China?
CAMBRIDGE – For years, Americans have misunderstood the nuclear threat from North Korea, misjudging how to address it.
They have also misunderstood the bilateral trade deficits with China, overestimating their importance.
Today, as President Donald Trump threatens new trade barriers against China, on which the United States must depend to help rein in an increasingly dangerous North Korea, these two issues have become closely connected. Yet US officials seem no closer to figuring them out.
The stakes obviously are much higher regarding North Korea, with US-South Korean joint military exercises this week aggravating already-high tensions.
If the US and North Korea do get into a military confrontation, there is a real risk that nuclear weapons will be used. Even a conventional war would likely be catastrophic.
Trade is relevant to the North Korean nuclear challenge, because strict economic sanctions by China – potentially including a halt in oil supplies – are probably the world’s best bet for stopping the North’s nuclear program (in exchange for certain security guarantees from the US).
Trump may well understand this. But he apparently believes that he can use US trade with China as a bargaining chip to secure its help in dealing with North Korea.
This is the wrong approach.
Trump’s approach to governance – characterized by an unprecedented lack of interest in rules, principles, alliances, and institutions – is sometimes described as transactional.
Justifications of that approach typically focus on Trump’s business background, which supposedly makes him the dealmaker the US needs.
In fact, Trump’s behavior reflects a lack of regard for some of the most elementary requirements for successful negotiation.
A skillful negotiator knows that one must look at the game from the other player’s viewpoint, in order to determine which outcomes they may view as favorable, and find common ground.
Moreover, concluding a deal requires credibility with respect to both inducements and punishments.
Trump’s attempts at bargaining with China reflect a failure on both fronts.
From China’s perspective, a nuclear-armed North Korea is undesirable, but still less problematic than the potential breakdown of order in the country, which could produce an influx of refugees into China and bring American troops closer to China’s border.
Against this background, erratic US trade threats are not the way to convince China to apply pressure on its troublesome ally.
Instead, the US, along with South Korea, should promise that, if Chinese-backed sanctions did cause the North Korean regime to collapse, China would not be confronted either by US troops north of the 38th parallel or by a unified, nuclear-armed Korean Peninsula.
In the shorter term, the US and South Korea should offer to pause the deployment of America’s Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system in South Korea, if China adopts and enforces additional sanctions on the North.
But credibility on the part of the US president is needed to make this – or any – strategy work.
Unfortunately, Trump’s statements – whether about the past, the present, or the future – are often out of touch with reality.
On the North Korean nuclear issue alone, he has shown a remarkable lack of consistency, credibility, and follow-through.
In January, Trump tweeted that North Korea’s development of a nuclear weapon capable of reaching parts of the US “won’t happen!”
By July, the North was testing an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of reaching the US, and it is believed that the country already possesses the capability to produce a miniaturized, ICBM-ready nuclear payload.
Earlier this month, when Trump said that any North Korean threat “will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen,” North Korean leader Kim Jong-un responded by threatening to attack Guam.
Instead of delivering fire and fury, Trump reiterated that if Kim “utters one threat in a form of an overt threat … he will truly regret it. And he will regret it fast.”
These statements clearly are neither credible nor accurate.
Trump has displayed similar caprice and lack of follow-through with respect to China.
In December, then-President-elect Trump challenged the “One China” policy that his predecessors, Democrats and Republicans alike, had respected.
He either didn’t know that China is more willing to go to war over Taiwan than the US is, or was displaying his characteristic shortsightedness.
In any case, on February 9, he had to reverse his position, losing face just a couple of weeks after his inauguration and setting a bad precedent for future deal-making with the strategically savvy Chinese.
Likewise, Trump backed down on his oft-repeated promise that he would name China a currency manipulator as soon as he took office.
It was a foolish threat all along – not least because, if Chinese authorities had stopped intervening in the foreign-exchange market in 2015-2016, the result would have been a weaker renminbi, not a stronger one.
By now, Chinese President Xi Jinping, like most world leaders, has learned to discount Trump’s warnings.
Trump’s statements suggesting a lack of loyalty to America’s allies – he took months to affirm his support for Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty, NATO’s bedrock collective-defense clause – have left even close US partners hesitant to make deals with his administration.
The White House is still pursuing aggressive trade-policy measures against China, only some of which have any merit.
(While the effort to enforce intellectual property rights has some basis in reality, the attempt to block steel imports using a national-security exemption is farcical.)
But these initiatives will not do much, if anything, for America’s trade balance, real income growth, or employment. And they certainly won’t convince China to help mitigate the North Korean nuclear threat.
The US Cannot Go It Alone On Iran
NEW YORK – US President Donald Trump has announced what was long anticipated: that he will not certify that Iran is complying with the July 2015 “Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action” (JCPOA) signed by the United States, China, Russia, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, and Iran.
Nor will he certify that the suspension of sanctions undertaken by the US as part of the agreement is justified and in the vital national interest of the US.
To be clear, such certifications are not required by the JCPOA.
Rather, they are required every 90 days by a law enacted by the US Congress soon after the accord was signed.
It is also essential to underscore that Trump did not withdraw from the JCPOA itself.
What he chose was a compromise: to make clear his disdain for the agreement without leaving it or reintroducing sanctions that were removed as part of it (a step that would be tantamount to US withdrawal).
What happens next is unclear.
Congress has 60 days to reintroduce some or all of the suspended sanctions but is unlikely to do so.
It might, however, introduce new sanctions tied to Iran’s behavior in Syria or elsewhere in the region.
Consistent with this, Trump announced his intention to place extra sanctions on Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.
If the US were to impose new sanctions for any purpose at any time, it would likely find itself alone.
The Europeans, China, and Russia are highly unlikely to join, not only because of financial self-interest, but also because Iran is in compliance with the JCPOA.
This is a point made by international inspectors operating under United Nations auspices, as well as by senior US officials, including Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis.
To argue, as some in America do, that Iran is not complying with the spirit of the JCPOA is meaningless: “spirit” is a phrase without legal standing.
And while it is fair to argue that much of what Iran is doing in the region is a legitimate cause for concern, it is not grounds for reintroducing sanctions under the accord.
Renegotiating the JCPOA to extend the duration of several of its constraints, make inspections more intrusive, and expand its coverage to missiles is attractive in the abstract.
But it is totally unworkable in practice, as Iran and most (or all) of the other signatories of the JCPOA would reject these demands.
The threat to terminate US participation in the JCPOA if such changes are not made will thus prove either empty or self-defeating if carried out.
None of this is meant to argue that the JCPOA is a good agreement.
Still, Trump’s decision not to certify was unwarranted and ill-advised.
The agreement was the result of a collective effort.
American unilateralism now could make forging a common front against Iran much more difficult in the future.
Trump’s move is also bad for US foreign policy.
There must be a presumption of continuity if a great power is to be great.
Unpredictability can provide a tactical advantage, but it is also a strategic liability.
Here there is an obvious link with North Korea.
At some point, the US may determine that diplomacy has a role in managing the North Korean nuclear and missile challenges.
But America’s ability to offer a credible diplomatic path will be seriously undermined if others judge that it cannot be trusted to stand by agreements.
There is also a more immediate problem: if the US sets in motion a dynamic that causes the JCPOA to unravel, and Iran resumes nuclear activities currently precluded by the accord, a crisis will erupt at a time when the US already has its hands full with North Korea.
Despite these considerations, it would also be a mistake to focus just on the US announcement and not also on Iranian behavior.
In the short run, the world needs to contend with an Iran that is an imperial power, one that seeks to remake large swaths of the Middle East in its image.
What is needed is a policy of containment of Iran across the region – including support for the Kurds in northern Iraq and Syria, as well as of other groups and countries that are pushing back against Iran.
In the longer run, the challenge is to deal with the JCPOA’s flaws, above all with its sunset provisions.
The agreement “parked” the nuclear problem, rather than resolving it.
Important provisions of the accord will expire in either eight or 13 years.
At that time, inspections will not prevent Iran from putting in place many of the prerequisites of a nuclear weapons program that could be made operational with little warning.
It cannot be assumed, as some do, that Iran’s intentions and behavior will moderate over the next decade or 15 years.
On the contrary, Iran is more likely to remain a hybrid regime in which a government coexists with a permanent religious authority and with powerful military forces and intelligence units that exercise considerable political influence and largely operate outside the government’s control.
Dealing with an ambitious and powerful Iran thus entails a broad range of other open-ended challenges that define the ever-turbulent Middle East.
Without the JCPOA, however, those challenges would become even more daunting.
The Iran Nuclear Deal Is Bad – and Necessary
TEL AVIV – US President Donald Trump has refused to certify the nuclear agreement with Iran, launching a process by which the US Congress could re-impose sanctions on the country.
Fortunately, it seems likely that Congress, rather than pulling the plug on the deal, will seek some alternative that allows Trump to save face with his supporters, to whom he has long promised US withdrawal from the Iran deal.
Nonetheless, decertification is a serious mistake.
Like many Israelis, I agree with Trump that the international agreement reached with Iran in 2015 is fundamentally a bad deal.
But it is also a done deal.
Even if the United States does decide to withdraw from it completely, none of the other parties – not China or Russia or even the Europeans (France, Germany, and the United Kingdom) – will follow suit.
Iran would continue to reap the agreement’s benefits.
At the same time, however, Iran could view the US decision to renege on the deal as justification for reviving its halted nuclear program.
After all, the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act authorizes the US president to decertify the deal if Iran violates its terms.
And, at least technically, Iran has done no such thing.
Of course, Iran’s behavior – developing powerful ballistic missiles, helping to spread terror across the Middle East, and running intensive cyber warfare campaigns – is deeply troubling, and measures should be taken to apply pressure on Iran to address these issues.
But none of them was part of the nuclear deal.
In this context, if Trump does decertify the Iran deal right now, it will undermine America’s credibility when it comes to reining in another nuclear threat: North Korea.
If the US can default on its international commitments for no reason, why would Kim Jong-un bother to engage in negotiations?
Kim might be an extremist of the first order, but his motivations are easy to discern.
He views nuclear weapons as the ultimate insurance against a steep and ignominious fall, like those of Libya’s Muammar Qaddafi and Iraq’s Saddam Hussein.
Moreover, however mighty the US military is, it cannot destroy North Korea’s nuclear arsenal without provoking a counterattack inflicting untold destruction on South Korea and perhaps also Japan – both close US allies.
That gives Kim substantial leverage.
The only possible way to deter Kim is through coercive diplomacy that compels him to freeze his nuclear program at something like its current level.
And it was just this sort of coercive diplomacy, backed by sanctions and a united position among major international actors, that compelled Iran to sign its own deal.
If such diplomacy loses its credibility, Kim will inevitably continue to expand his nuclear-weapons program, and global risks will rise exponentially – not least because neighbors like South Korea and Japan will be increasingly eager to develop their own nuclear weapons.
With that, the cause of nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament – a goal that the US has pursued for almost 70 years – will be all but dead.
The most immediate threat would be a decision by Iran to relaunch its own nuclear-weapon program.
Should that happen, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey would be virtually certain to pursue nuclear breakout.
In fact, any third-rate dictator in the world watching these developments might decide to pursue nuclear weapons.
The entire global order would be fundamentally changed.
North Korea is the proverbial horse that has broken the stable door and bolted.
But, thanks to the current agreement, the Iranian horse remains in the barn.
The US should be attempting to corral North Korea, not giving Iran reason to bolt, too.
This does not mean that the US needs to be passive.
In fact, the US should be preparing for a potential future Iranian nuclear breakout – a distinct possibility, even if the current deal is upheld.
Iran would be unlikely to pursue nuclear breakout immediately, because the deal still affords it substantial benefits.
A few years from now, however, those benefits would be largely secured, giving Iran less reason to stick to its promises.
Given this, rather than parting ways with the other parties that helped to negotiate the agreement, the US should be seeking a consensus on what would constitute an Iranian breakout, in order to help guide the inspections conducted by the International Atomic Energy Agency.
The US should also coordinate with the agreement’s other signatories regarding the sanctions and other punishments that would be meted out if Iran actually did breach the deal.
For any of this to work, however, the “big American stick” must be present.
The US must be prepared, in terms of intelligence, weapons, and political will, to intervene – unilaterally, if needed – to stop Iran, should it try to follow in North Korea’s footsteps.
Deal or no deal, Iran represents a serious threat – to Israel, of course, but also to the stability of the Middle East and, in a sense, of the whole world.
But, as of now, that threat is not existential.
Preventing it from becoming so should be a top priority today.
We in Israel who have been thinking seriously about this challenge for some time – not to mention working hard to prepare ourselves for various contingencies – recognize that, for now, our security is best served by maintaining the current deal.
Over the last 25 years, six countries have tried to turn themselves into nuclear states.
Two of them – Libya and South Africa – gave up.
Another two – Syria and Iraq – were stopped.
And two – Pakistan and North Korea – succeeded, in defiance of the international community.
We must ensure that Iran is not allowed to join their ranks.
And, so long as Iran remains compliant, the nuclear deal, however bad it is, remains our best chance to do just that.
Trump the Destroyer
LONDON – With all the skill of an experienced arsonist, US President Donald Trump is preparing America for a firestorm.
His actions have heightened insecurity, instability, and fear, while potentially making populations elsewhere in the world even more susceptible to political fire-starters.
Voters in the United States who thought they were supporting the only capable firefighter around have been played.
But Trump has a knack for manipulating perceptions.
To deflect attention from potentially incendiary policies, he launches baseless accusations against his supposed enemies – beginning with the media.
Portraying negative coverage as “fake news” has helped Trump to distract from scandals big and small: his family’s conflicts of interest, his dodgy business deals around the world, white supremacists among his senior staff, the rejection of ethics training for senior White House staff, and much else.
Perhaps the most prominent such scandal concerns the string of revelations tying Trump’s administration to Russia, including the resignation of National Security Adviser Michael Flynn over “misleading” the vice president about the nature of his pre-inauguration conversations with Russia’s ambassador to the US.
When the charge of “fake news” proved inadequate to silence the whispers, Trump pulled out the big (still imaginary) guns, tweeting that former President Barack Obama had Trump Tower’s “wires tapped” before the election.
Amid the bread and circuses, Trump continues along his path of demolition.
His first proposed budget would slash funding for social programs, efforts to reduce drug use and trafficking, the arts, climate science, medical research, education, Meals on Wheels (food delivery for the elderly), financial assistance for low-income college students, the Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children, and much else.
He is determined to eliminate environmental protections as well: one of his first major actions was to eliminate a rule restricting coal companies from dumping mining waste into streams.
In the meantime, Trump will pursue his goal of drastically increasing defense spending, even as his policies put some members of US military families at risk of deportation.
Such moves are egregious, and companies must resist taking advantage of them, even if they seem to benefit the company in the short term.
Board members and executives must remember that they are also parents, children, partners, and friends.
They should fear a future of overwhelming pollution, inadequate education, poor working conditions, increasingly extreme weather events, geopolitical conflict, and the destruction of programs and policies created to build a safer, more secure, and more prosperous future for all.
Trump is no leader; he cannot create, only distract and destroy – and put his name on what others have built.
That is also true of his proposed wall on the US border with Mexico, which will outshine all the buildings around the world – from Brazil to Indonesia – to which he has licensed his name.
In size, scope, and fame, the wall will surpass the Hoover Dam and Mount Rushmore.
No highway or airport named after a US president will come close.
(The one thing on which Trump does not want his name is the Republicans’ widely derided new health-care proposal, intended to replace Obama’s signature Affordable Care Act.)
What’s next?
Perhaps Trump will follow the example of Saparmurat Niyazov, Turkmenistan’s first president for life, and start renaming the months of the year, beginning with “Trumpuary.”
The absurdity need not end there.
Having already run roughshod over nepotism norms, why not, appoint his wife Vice President, as the presidents of Azerbaijan and Nicaragua have done.
Or he could start marching around in a faux military uniform, made to his own specifications (by a Trump Organization subsidiary and manufactured in China, of course).
He already visited an aircraft carrier in a bomber jacket and cap.
Not even Trump believes his own act.
He certainly can’t sustain it for long.
His governance by id means that he will always reveal his true self, whether in the form of maniacal claims like those about being wiretapped, or when he reveals his true intentions by saying that his latest travel ban is just the old one watered down.
So when does it all become too ludicrous?
At what point will commentators stop gushing that Trump has finally become “presidential” every time he sticks to a script?
When they will stop treating every raving tweet as part of a rational plan?
Trump’s cohorts, many of whom are not accustomed to life in the spotlight, only make matters worse.
Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, for example, noting that he is “not a big media press access person,” flies around the world without a press entourage – unsurprising for a former CEO of a multinational oil company, but highly unusual for the top US diplomat.
And Tillerson cut short his trip to South Korea – in the midst of a growing crisis on the peninsula – due to fatigue (a reminder never to send a man to do a woman’s job).
As Trump occupies himself with manipulating appearances and performances, the rest of the world is concerned about North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs, the crisis in Syria, the Brexit negotiations, climate change, and the growing threat of starvation and famine in Yemen, Somalia, South Sudan, and Nigeria.
Against this background, the last thing the world needs is a volatile and unabashedly dishonest US president, much less one who likes to play with matches.
Making Crises Great Again
CAMBRIDGE – Debates about financial regulation tend to focus on quantity, not quality.
But “more versus less” isn’t so much the issue; the details are.
And when it comes to financial reform in the United States, President Donald Trump is unlikely to get the details right.
Earlier this month, Trump issued an executive order directing a comprehensive review of the Dodd-Frank financial-reform legislation of 2010.
The administration’s goal is to scale back significantly the regulatory system put in place in response to the 2008 financial crisis. This is a risky move.
Dodd-Frank’s key features – such as higher capital requirements for banks, the establishment of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the designation of Systemically Important Financial Institutions, tough stress tests on banks, and enhanced transparency for derivatives – have strengthened the financial system considerably.
Undermining or rescinding them would substantially increase the risk of an eventual recurrence of the 2007-2008 financial crisis.
This is not to say that current legislation could not be improved.
The most straightforward way to do that would be to restore some of the worthwhile features of the original plan that have been weakened or negated over the last seven years.
Dodd-Frank might, in theory, also benefit from a more efficient tradeoff between the compliance costs that banks and other financial institutions confront and the danger of systemic instability (in areas like the “Volcker Rule” restricting proprietary trading by banks).
But achieving this would be a difficult and delicate task.
Contrary to what some in the financial industry seem to believe, there is no evidence that Trump will manage it properly.
On the contrary, even before the review of Dodd-Frank gets going, Trump has already gotten financial regulation badly wrong.
As Trump ordered the review of Dodd-Frank, he also suspended implementation, pending review, of the so-called fiduciary rule, adopted, after extensive preparation, by President Barack Obama’s administration.
The rule, which was supposed to take effect in April, is intended to ensure that professional financial advisers and brokers act in the best interests of their clients when collecting fees to advise them on assets invested through retirement plans.
The need for such a rule is clear.
Many investment advisers and brokers are motivated by conflicts of interest to recommend a stock, bond, or fund that is not quite as good as another.
For example, the adviser may receive an undisclosed commission or de facto “kickback” for recommending a particular product. It may be the advising firm’s own offering.
Because most investors assume that their advisers are obliged to act in their best interests, they don’t second-guess the recommendations.
The end result is underperformance of the saver’s retirement account.
Canceling the fiduciary rule would have no purpose other than to maximize financial institutions’ profits, at the expense of the average American family.
The rule’s opponents make the argument that the requirement amounts to government overreach, because it deprives families of choices.
This is disingenuous, because it disregards the reason why savers seek the services of financial advisers in the first place: to help them figure out what investments best serve their interests.
A saver could always choose not to hire a financial adviser.
Those who believe their judgment to be superior to that of the average investor can choose which individual assets or actively managed funds to buy and sell.
Such investors distill information on their own and have no need for a retirement savings adviser to help them sift through the huge variety of financial assets, products, and funds that is available, particularly in a country like the US.
But there are downsides to this approach.
Most investors who pursue it buy and sell too often, burn through a lot of money in cumulative transaction costs, and are unrealistically optimistic about their ability to pick winners or time the market.
An alternative, recommended by most economists, would be for savers simply to park their money in broadly diversified low-cost funds, such as the index funds offered by Vanguard.
Here, too, there is no need for a professional adviser.
Recommended allocations of individuals’ total financial wealth are something like 60% equities, 30% bonds, and 10% cash, depending mainly on the saver’s degree of risk aversion and need for liquid assets.
Yet many small investors just can’t bring themselves to believe that index funds are the best they can do.
Recognizing that they lack the time, skills, or interest necessary to invest their savings independently, they seek the services of an investment adviser.
They want to discuss their portfolios with an expert, with someone they can trust to give them good advice.
But if that expert can’t be relied upon to put savers’ interests first, why are they collecting fees?
Of course, not all financial advisers act contrary to their clients’ interests.
Some apply a fiduciary standard in practice, to earn their clients’ trust, even though the law does not yet require them to do so.
Truly ethical advisers tend to support Obama’s fiduciary rule, because the removal of unscrupulous competitors is good for their business.
In this sense, the financial industry is no different from the used-car business.
The dealers who would oppose a law preventing them from turning back the odometer are probably the ones engaging in that practice.
Honest dealers would favor it as a way to level the playing field.
They do not claim that such laws deprive consumers of the “choice” to buy a used car under fraudulent terms.
It is in ordinary Americans’ best interest for the fiduciary rule to go into effect in April, as planned.
They would be best served if the Trump administration kept its hands off Obama’s other financial reforms, too.
How Trump Could Rebuild America
BERKELEY – In the United States today, with partisan polarization at record levels, there is still at least one policy goal on which there is broad consensus, not only among Republicans and Democrats, but also among business and labor leaders, states and cities, and ordinary citizens: infrastructure.
The US has been short-changing infrastructure for years.
Historically, federal, state, and local governments have together invested about 2.5% of GDP in non-defense infrastructure assets.
But, over the last 35 years, federal investment as a share of GDP has dropped by more than half.
For a long time, state and local governments were able to cover the shortfall, increasing their contribution to three quarters of total spending.
But when the Great Recession hit, states and cities were forced to slash their budgets.
As a result, in the second quarter of this year, total public expenditure on infrastructure fell to an estimated 1.4% of GDP, the lowest share on record.
This is all the more worrying, given the already-poor state of US infrastructure, which earned a grade of D+ from the American Society of Civil Engineers in its 2017 quadrennial report.
Almost 20% of US highways are in disrepair.
The costs and consequences of deferred maintenance are apparent everywhere, and almost every city and state has its horror stories: dysfunctional subways in New York City, lead-contaminated drinking water in Flint, Michigan, the near-collapse of a major dam in Oroville, California.
The report estimates that restoring US infrastructure to “a state of good repair” would cost $4.6 trillion between 2016 and 2025.
That is $2.1 trillion more than has been committed so far.
Developing new funding sources for infrastructure investment is therefore critical.
An innovative strategy under discussion in Washington, DC, is linked to corporate-tax reform – a priority for President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans.
Under the current tax system, US multinationals can defer tax payments on their foreign earnings until the earnings are repatriated.
With foreign earnings growing and foreign corporate-tax rates falling, deferral has become increasingly attractive.
As a result, US companies are holding an estimated $2.6 trillion in foreign earnings abroad, rather than repatriating it and paying taxes that could be used to finance, say, domestic infrastructure investment.
Since 2013, the US Congress has floated several reform proposals to increase revenues collected on the stock of foreign earnings.
Two recent bipartisan bills – which seem to have the support of Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, among others – link such reforms directly to federal infrastructure funding.
But Trump seems eager for state and local governments, which are in the strongest position to assess the needs of their communities, to shoulder much of the burden.
Federal funding, he has signaled, would be limited to “high priority,” “transformative” national projects and used as leverage to encourage public-private partnerships (PPPs).
Private investors have long been eager to invest in public infrastructure – such as transportation or energy – in exchange for a share of those projects’ future revenues.
Of course, private investors are generally not interested in projects that don’t generate revenue – such as, say, school libraries, urban “greenways,” or low-income housing – despite the importance of those projects for the economy and society.
In some areas, however, PPPs can offer substantial value.
Though private finance may be more expensive than tax-advantaged public finance, over a project’s entire life, a PPP can benefit its government partner in numerous ways: through innovation; reduced design, construction, and lifetime maintenance costs; and risk mitigation.
To date, PPPs have played only a minor role in infrastructure development in the US.
Trump seems convinced that the problem is a lack of available private capital, and thus has proposed a tax plan that includes generous credits to encourage private investment in infrastructure.
That is the wrong approach.
What is really limiting private infrastructure investment is, to some extent, public opposition to the private ownership of public assets and, mainly, impediments to matching private capital with infrastructure opportunities.
While 37 states have some form of enabling legislation and regulatory framework for infrastructure PPPs, there are wide disparities among states.
Moreover, many states and localities lack the capacity to evaluate the costs and benefits of PPPs – a problem that President Barack Obama proposed solving with a new federal PPP knowledge center.
Ultimately, restoring America’s failing infrastructure will require what we call “progressive federalism”: harnessing the strengths of each level of government and working with the private sector to address pressing social and economic challenges.
The federal government must promote national-level goals; impose tough criteria for project selection and rigorous performance metrics in construction and maintenance; and push state and local governments to eliminate bureaucratic red tape and costly internecine squabbles.
From a financial perspective, it should provide adequate funding for projects of national and regional significance, and use its financial leverage to overcome obstacles and enforce best practices.
State governors and city mayors, for their part, must take the lead in setting state and local priorities, with each deciding whether to opt into national projects.
And private investors can provide risk capital, innovation, and management expertise, both as contractors on publicly funded projects and as partners in revenue-generating projects.
To support such a process, we urge Congress to establish a “Commission on Twenty-First-Century Infrastructure,” co-chaired by teams from the National Governors Association (perhaps led by Republican Governor John Kasich of Ohio) and the Conference of Mayors (perhaps led by Democratic Mayor Eric Garcetti of Los Angeles).
The Commission should include business leaders and cabinet-level representatives of the Trump administration, like Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao and National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn.
At a time when Americans seem to agree on little else, almost everyone agrees that it is time to rebuild the country’s infrastructure.
The task now is to turn consensus into action.
Trump’s Quixotic Energy Policy
MADRID – April 22, 2017 – International Earth Day – marks one year since the signing of the Paris climate agreement, which entered into force last November, and now has 195 signatories.
That landmark multilateral treaty still represents the most important step forward to date in the global fight against climate change.
But its first anniversary has been darkened by US President Donald Trump’s energy policies.
In 2016, the hottest year on record, average global temperatures were 0.9º C above the twentieth-century average.
The Paris agreement’s main objective is to prevent average world temperatures from rising more than 2º C above pre-industrial levels by 2100.
Notably, developing countries such as China and India – the world’s largest and third-largest greenhouse-gas producers, respectively – have committed themselves to reaching this goal.
The Paris agreement established a revolutionary new framework for such commitments: the “Nationally Determined Contributions”.
Each signatory country outlines in its NDC its voluntary contribution toward the common global goal of mitigating the impact of anthropogenic climate change.
After suggesting during the presidential campaign that he would “cancel” the Paris agreement, Trump later claimed to be keeping “an open mind” about it.
But while the world waits to see what he decides, his administration has issued a budget blueprint that is hardly in line with the spirit of the accord.
Trump is proposing to eliminate federal funding for scientific research on climate change, and to slash the Environmental Protection Agency’s budget by nearly a third.
As if that were not enough, he recently issued an executive order instructing government agencies to roll back the Obama-era Clean Power Plan, which was designed to limit emissions from coal-fired power plants, and promote renewable energies.
“My administration is putting an end to the war on coal,” Trump declared while signing the order.
Trump went on to promise that he would deliver “clean coal, really clean coal.”
But “clean coal” is an oxymoron.
At best, we can aspire to cleaner coal, by implementing costly measures whose effectiveness is still debated among environmental experts.
In any case, Trump’s policies are not likely to reverse the steady decline in US coal production.
And in the laxer regulatory environment Trump favors, so-called clean coal has no chance of competing with conventional coal.
From a business standpoint, “clean coal” is viable only with the right incentives, not least a price on carbon.
Moreover, the US coal industry will continue to lose out to another industry that Trump supports: shale-gas production.
Over the last decade, increased shale-gas extraction has driven down the price of natural gas, rapidly eroding coal’s position in the US energy mix.
While natural gas is also a fossil fuel, it generates only about half the CO2 that conventional coal does.
In principle, it is less harmful, so long as production is strictly controlled to prevent methane, the main component of natural gas, from leaking into the atmosphere.
Unfortunately, given the content of Trump’s executive order, such controls are not likely.
Though market forces alone will not give rise to a decarbonized economy, they do play a critical role.
And the private sector has come around to viewing renewable energies as a potentially profitable business.
In the US, the cost of wind energy has fallen by two-thirds since 2009, and the cost of utility-scale solar energy has decreased by 85%.
In addition, according to a recent US Department of Energy report, the number of jobs in the wind and solar industries increased by 32% and 25%, respectively, in 2016 alone.
Trump’s policy priorities will inevitably clash with those of states such as California, which has been taking the initiative to encourage climate-minded technological innovation.
And, fortunately for the planet, other global powers are not joining Trump in backing away from their climate commitments.
China – which is acutely aware of its severe environmental problems – understands the socioeconomic boon that investment in renewable energies can provide.
The European Commission does, too, with recent signs that economic growth can be decoupled from emissions having provided further encouragement.
Both Europe and China have also come to recognize the geostrategic advantages that renewable-energy sources confer – specifically, increased energy security, as vulnerability to natural disasters, and the threat of terrorism, decreases.
If anything, Trump’s policy of fossil-fuel promotion will end up undermining US energy independence, rather than strengthening it, as he claims, because it will allow other countries to take the lead on the central political and economic issue of the twenty-first century.
The same can be said for his rejection of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), which China is already trying to replace with a regional trade pact that would exclude the US.
Trump’s policies could also endanger the long-term commitments that the US made when it signed onto the Paris agreement, even if the immediate effects of his policies are limited by market factors.
But if Trump does finally decide to abandon – rather than “cancel” – the agreement, that choice could have an even stronger negative impact on international efforts to reduce emissions – a point that even ExxonMobil has made.
The fight against climate change is far from over.
If we maintain existing levels of greenhouse-gas emissions, we will fall short of the objectives established in Paris.
Regardless of how much markets come to favor renewable-energy sources, we will still need better national regulations – such as carbon pricing– to create economic incentives and manage negative externalities stemming from energy production.
A stable climate is a global public good that can be achieved only through the kind of international coordination embodied in the Paris agreement.
That is why we must defend it.
Sowing doubt about the deal’s importance or the scientific evidence backing it up would be a ruinous error.
Why Business is Greener than Trump
LONDON – The relationship between business, politics, and the environment is about to become more complicated.
As US President Donald Trump’s administration threatens to dismantle vital environmental protections, some of which have existed for decades, business leaders are increasingly recognizing – and acting upon – the need for environmentally sustainable policies.
Trump, who once called climate change a Chinese hoax intended to weaken the US economy, has already repealed the Stream Protection Rule, which bars coal producers from dumping waste into waterways.
Next on the chopping block may be the Clean Power Plan, which limits greenhouse-gas emissions from generating plants – by far the country’s largest source of CO2 emissions – with the goal of cutting carbon pollution from the power sector to 32% below 2005 levels by 2030.
The Trump administration has even threatened to back out of the Paris climate agreement, to which the world’s governments committed in 2015.
A decade ago, business leaders would have largely welcomed such regressive environmental policies, which can lower costs and expand opportunities, by reducing constraints on their companies’ behavior.
But today, even as markets respond bullishly to Trump’s “business-friendly” pledges – not just deregulation and tax cuts, but also a trillion-dollar infrastructure plan that would include reviving coal – business leaders have remained cautious.
In particular, they have strong reservations about a potential withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement.
Whatever benefits could be derived from a low-regulation economy would not offset the harm of reneging on environmental commitments that are viewed as vital to American business success.
Some are already making their voices heard on the matter.
Since Trump’s election, nearly 900 companies and investors, many of them American, have signed an open letter, “Business Backs Low Carbon,” calling on the administration not to withdraw the US from the Paris agreement.
These companies, which include large multinationals, believe that failure to build a low-carbon economy would jeopardize America’s prosperity.
There is compelling recent research to support this view.
Last month, a study by Energy Innovation showed that elimination of the Clean Power Plan alone could cost the US $600 billion and cause 120,000 premature deaths by 2050.
By contrast, efforts to build a more sustainable economy would bring far-reaching benefits.
A December 2016 report by the Risky Business Project, led by American CEOs and former municipal and federal leaders, shows that savings in fuel costs from an 80% reduction in CO2 emissions by 2050 could exceed the required capital investment by $150 billion.
Last January, the Business & Sustainable Development Commission, which I chair, estimated in its flagship report that companies could unlock $12 trillion globally in revenue and savings by pursuing sustainable business models.
Such models can also create up to 380 million jobs by 2030 in key economic sectors, including food and agriculture, energy, transport, health, and municipal government.
In the energy sector alone, the opportunities are valued at $4.3 trillion.
Corporate strategies are increasingly falling into line with these findings.
In 2005, on the heels of Hurricane Katrina, which devastated the US Gulf Coast and affected a significant regional consumer base for Walmart, the company’s then-CEO Lee Scott delivered a telling speech, entitled “Twenty-First Century Leadership,” to all company employees.
Scott set significant environmental goals, as part of a broader vision for Walmart to become a more responsible corporate citizen.
Today, Walmart is a leading commercial solar and on-site renewable-energy user, deriving about 25% of its global energy consumption from renewable sources.
(The company’s goal, set by Scott, is to rely entirely on renewables.)
By increasing the efficiency of its US fleet of trucks, Walmart avoided the emission of nearly 650,000 metric tons of CO2 from 2005 to 2015, and saved nearly $1 billion in 2016 alone.
Another US company, Mars, Inc., is on a similar path.
A signatory of the Business Backs Low Carbon letter, Mars is working to eliminate its greenhouse-gas emissions entirely by 2040, through greater efficiency and investment in renewable energy projects like wind turbines.
The company’s CEO, Grant Reid, is also a member of the Business & Sustainable Development Commission.
But, while business leadership and collective action are needed to create a sustainable and inclusive economy (a central message of our commission’s report), the private sector cannot do it alone.
Government must be an active partner, helping to scale sustainable activities by creating market conditions that spur a “race to the top” and unlock the finance needed to keep America competitive and innovative.
So it is not enough simply to oppose Trump’s environmentally damaging policies; businesses need to get his administration on their side, so that the US authorities create an environment that encourages sustainable practices and green innovation.
Such an environment could include carbon pricing, which a growing number of businesses are pursuing internally, and tax credits for carbon efficiency.
Trump’s own businesses have benefited from such government interventions.
As the New York Times recently revealed, in 2012, Trump secured nearly $1 million in energy-efficiency incentives and low-interest loans from New York State.
A groundswell of support from CEOs, on a nonpartisan basis, could be the key to spurring the needed action.
Before the Paris climate conference, politicians knew that environmental activists wanted a deal to limit climate change; arguably, what ultimately drove them to act, however, was finding out that CEOs and boards felt the same way.
Business leaders need to show Trump that they are not cheerleaders for coal, pollution, and global warming.
They are determined champions of an enlightened environmentalism that is in the interest of all their stakeholders – customers, shareholders, employees, and the communities in which they operate.
The Return of the Madman Theory
MOSCOW – In the 1970s, US President Richard Nixon instructed Secretary of State Henry Kissinger to convince the leaders of hostile communist countries that he could be erratic and volatile, particularly when under pressure.
Kissinger, a shrewd practitioner of Realpolitik, saw the potential in this approach, which he readily implemented.
With that, the “madman theory” of diplomacy was born.
Nixon was far from mad, though his heavy drinking at the height of the Watergate scandal prompted Kissinger and Secretary of Defense James Schlesinger to establish a way to monitor his control of the nuclear codes.
Nixon’s goal in trumpeting his supposed erratic nature was to stoke fear among his foreign adversaries that making him angry or stressed could result in an irrational – even nuclear – response, thereby impelling them to check their own behavior.
Today, with Donald Trump leading the United States, the madman doctrine is back with a vengeance.
But, this time around, it is far less clear that it’s just an act, and that Trump would not really decide, in a fit of rage or frustration, to attack, or even nuke, his opponents.
Exhibit A in a hearing on Trump’s sanity would have to be his recent address to the United Nations General Assembly, which resembled the lunatic ramblings of Aerys Targaryen, the “mad king” in the television show “Game of Thrones.”
Putting his own spin on Targaryen’s infamous line “burn them all,” Trump threatened that the US would “totally destroy” North Korea if it continues to develop its nuclear program.
In the same speech, Trump also savaged the 2015 nuclear agreement with Iran.
As he spoke, his chief of staff, retired US Marine Corps General John Kelly, who was appointed in July to bring order and a degree of stability to Trump’s White House sanitarium, could be seen with his head in his hands, as if in shock or despair.
Many Americans have perhaps grown desensitized to Trump’s off-the-wall tirades, having endured months of his late-night Twitter assaults on the press, his opponents and fellow Republicans, even his own cabinet members.
The famously thin-skinned Trump has shown that, when provoked or insulted, he can be counted on to retaliate.
But, unlike many of Trump’s previous unhinged ramblings, the UN speech was read from a teleprompter, which means that it was vetted ahead of time.
Those who thought that the “grownups” in Trump’s administration – Kelly, Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, and National Security Advisor H.R. McMaster – would keep US security strategy within the bounds of reason might need to think again.
Perhaps the maddest part of all is Trump’s apparent calculation that North Korea’s boy-king Kim Jong-un might cower in the face of his threats.
After President Ronald Reagan called the Soviet Union an “evil empire” in 1983, he was advised not to repeat it, in the interest of improving the bilateral relationship.
Recognizing the importance of such an improvement for mitigating the nuclear threat, Reagan followed his advisers’ counsel.
The same cannot be said of Trump, who surely has been warned of the dangers of hurling insults like “Rocket Man” at the brutal and inexperienced Kim.
When Nixon adopted his own “mad” persona, he was in some ways drawing on the example of Nikita Khrushchev, my grandfather and Nixon’s adversary during his tenure as US vice president.
In the so-called “kitchen debate” of 1959 – one of the Cold War’s weirdest moments – Nixon sparred with Khrushchev in Moscow over the superiority of capitalism over socialism.
A year later, at the UN General Assembly in New York, Khrushchev made quite the appearance.
Cuba’s new revolutionary leader Fidel Castro was, as was his wont, flamboyantly issuing extravagant threats.
Not to be outdone, “Hurricane Nikita” used every opportunity to stir the diplomatic pot, whistling and banging his fists – and even, allegedly, his shoe – on the desk.
There was abundant evidence that Western powers had been trying to hoodwink the Soviet Union.
A U-2 reconnaissance aircraft, which President Dwight Eisenhower had denied existed, had been shot down over Soviet territory.
Moreover, the US had demanded that the Soviet Union respect the Monroe Doctrine, which assigned Latin America to America’s sphere of interest, but was unwilling to accept Soviet hegemony in Eastern Europe.
And it had dismissed a Soviet-initiated disarmament plan, the first official attempt at peaceful coexistence, out of hand.
The West, Khrushchev thought, didn’t take him seriously.
This is why he acted so outrageously at the UN.
He behaved, he explained later, as the early Bolsheviks would: when you disagree with an opponent, you must make your argument loud and clear – and drown theirs with noise.
In 1962, Khrushchev took this approach a step further, testing the young President John F. Kennedy with a “mad” plan to install nuclear missiles in Cuba.
The move triggered the Cuban Missile Crisis, the most dangerous standoff of the Cold War.
But JFK did not cower, nor did he respond with bluster.
Instead, he cleverly ignored Khrushchev’s threats, and instead responded to a letter that showed the Soviet premier as a rational leader negotiating for parity in world affairs.
That cool calculation enabled JFK and Khrushchev to defuse tensions, saving the world from nuclear conflict.
The world must now hope that Trump can begin to act as coolly in assessing Kim as JFK was dealing with Khrushchev.
Kim responded to Trump’s UN speech by calling him “mentally deranged” and a “dotard.”
Either Trump’s madman act is working, or Kim is more right than he – or the rest of us – would like.
Donald Trump’s Climate Fantasies
NEW YORK – Legend holds that King Canute brought his flatterers to the sea to show them that even a king could not command the ocean waves, that the laws of nature are more powerful than the decrees of men.
So pity Donald Trump, who really believes that his executive orders can hold back the tides.
Trump is surrounded by cronies rather than flatterers, and they and their foolish, ignorant king believe that by denying climate change they can restore the wealth and glory of coal, oil, and gas.
They are wrong.
Greed will not reverse human-caused climate change, and Trump’s executive orders will not stop the global process of phasing out coal, oil, and gas in favor of wind, solar, hydro, nuclear, geothermal, and other low-carbon energy sources.
In less than 100 days, we have learned that Trump is a man living in a fantasy world.
He issues decrees, barks orders, sends out midnight Tweets, but to no avail.
The facts – real ones, not his “alternative” variety – keep intervening.
There is physics; there is law; there are courts; there are procedures; and there are voters, only 36% of whom approve of Trump’s job performance.
There is also China, which wins technologically and diplomatically from every self-defeating move by the incompetent US president.
The latest fantasy involves climate change.
Trump has issued executive orders that he claims will reverse former President Barack Obama’s climate policies.
His orders would rescind the Clean Power Plan regulations of the US Environmental Protection Agency; roll back standards to control methane releases from oil and gas production and distribution; and end the regulatory use of a “social cost of carbon,” introduced by the EPA to calibrate the dollar value of climate damage caused by the emission of an additional ton of carbon dioxide.
According to Trump, these new measures will create new jobs in the coal sector, achieve US “energy independence,” and boost economic growth.
In addition, Trump recently authorized the building of the Keystone XL pipeline from Alberta, Canada to the US state of Nebraska, with the purpose of linking Canada’s oil sands to oil refineries in the US.
Obama had rejected that project on the grounds that it would aggravate global warming.
Trump’s overriding motivation is to serve the economic interests of the US coal, oil, and gas industries, which provide ample campaign financing and media backing for the Republicans in Congress and in state governments across the country.
In short, this is political corruption: government policies in exchange for campaign funds.
ExxonMobil, Chevron, the US Chamber of Commerce, and Koch Industries are all major players, and almost all of the Republican members of Congress are implicated in this disgraceful behavior.
They are prepared to look like fools in public – denying climate science and global warming – as long as it keeps the campaign money flowing.
Whether or not Trump himself is foolish enough to believe what he says, he knows that his executive orders play into the sweet spot of Republican power.
But, as with so many of Trump’s decisions, there is more bark than bite, more bluster than reality.
First, Trump can’t stop the waves, or the rising ocean levels in the case of global warming.
The science is real, even if Trump is happy to show off his scientific ignorance.
Second, the world knows it’s real.
Every UN member state signed the Paris climate agreement in 2015.
The planet has just experienced the hottest three years on record.
The oceans are warming dramatically (recently damaging 93% of Australia’s Great Barrier Reef in the process).
Trump’s cynicism and ignorance will change no minds and will attract no followers globally.
Moreover, Trump’s actions will be challenged in court, and he will almost surely lose.
He will pump up a few voters in West Virginia and receive praise from Koch Industries.
But he will not be able to overturn the EPA’s regulation of CO2 emissions.
Those standards are protected by the Clean Air Act, and Trump lacks the votes in Congress – by a wide margin – to change that legislation.
And American voters, by a wide margin, favor a shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy.
Even with America’s corrupt politics, the voters’ views still matter.
Nor can Trump revive the dying coal sector.
Coal has everything against it these days.
It causes lung disease among miners and the public living near coal-fired power plants.
It releases more CO2 per unit of energy than oil and gas, and it – and all the fossil fuels – is increasingly being outcompeted by wind, solar, hydropower, and other zero-carbon energy sources.
As for jobs, coal mining is becoming so automated that the entire sector employs just a few tens of thousands of workers in a labor force of more than 150 million.
Coal mining will play no significant role in future US employment trends, Trump or no Trump.
For the same reason, my bet is that the Keystone XL Pipeline, which would cost several billion dollars, will never be built.
The world does not need Canada’s oil sands, given the urgent global need to move to zero-carbon energy sources.
Canada’s oil sands are expensive to exploit, highly polluting, and far from markets.
Regardless of Trump’s approval, investors are likely to reject a pipeline that would probably go bankrupt well before the planned horizon for its use.
China, Europe, and even the Gulf region will not be swayed by Trump’s moves.
China is intent on lowering CO2 emissions, cleaning its air, and becoming the twenty-first-century leader in low-carbon technologies such as photovoltaics and electric vehicles.
Europe is well on its way to a zero-emission economy.
The Gulf countries are deploying large new capacity in renewable energy, especially solar energy.
In the end, we can be amazed at the foolishness of America’s president and the corruption of the US Republican Party.
But we should not believe that Trump’s climate fantasies will change global reality or alter the implementation of the Paris climate agreement.
The Perils of a Trumped Fed
ITHACA – While he attempts to overhaul American tax, trade, and immigration policies, President Donald Trump is mulling over a set of decisions that could prove even more consequential for the US economy.
With Federal Reserve Vice Chair Stanley Fischer having retired this month, three of the seven seats on the Fed Board of Governors are now vacant.
And in February 2018, Fed Chair Janet Yellen’s first term will end, giving Trump a unique opportunity to stamp his brand on the institution.
Trump’s nominees to fill these positions, and how he goes about choosing them, could have an enduring impact not just on the Fed, but also on the US economy and its central position in the global financial system.
The Fed’s credibility has been methodically and painstakingly established over the course of many decades.
A case in point is former Fed Chair Paul Volcker’s decision, in the early 1980s, to hike interest rates and accept a temporary increase in unemployment.
Had Volcker not acted, the US would have suffered from spiraling inflation.
Volcker’s move induced the short-term pain; but it also bolstered the Fed’s long-term credibility.
Inflation is driven by many factors that the Fed cannot control, including productivity, foreign prices, and government deficits. But expectations about the future can also play a key role.
When firms and workers think the Fed is not committed to holding down inflation, inflation tends to rise.
The same is true for deflation.
At first blush, falling prices for goods and services may sound like a good thing.
But deflation can be disastrous.
When prices are expected to fall, consumers will hold off on making purchases, and businesses will postpone investments.
These decisions can then create a vicious cycle in which falling demand leads to reduced employment, growth, and prices, causing demand to fall further.
After the 2008 global financial crisis, many countries faced the specter of deflation.
But, thanks to the Fed, the US avoided both severe deflation and inflation, and recovered faster than most other advanced economies.
The Fed managed to ward off deflation in the US by aggressively loosening monetary policy.
At the time, many economists feared that a rapidly expanding money supply and sharply rising government debt would fuel inflation and weaken the dollar.
But these fears proved unfounded, and the Fed’s credibility was bolstered once again.
The Fed’s credibility is what underpins the US dollar’s dominance in international finance.
About two-thirds of global central banks’ foreign-exchange reserves – that is to say, their rainy-day funds – are invested in dollars.
And foreign investors, including central banks, hold more than $6 trillion in US government securities, up from $3 trillion a decade ago.
The dollar’s status as the main global reserve currency has helped to keep US interest rates low, thus reducing borrowing costs for US consumers and the US government.
The Fed’s independence, along with the US’s institutionalized system of checks and balances and its adherence to the rule of law, is crucial for sustaining investors’ confidence in the dollar.
Yet the Trump administration is weakening the checks and balances between the executive and legislative branches of government, and his indifference to the rule of law could pose a direct challenge to the judicial branch.
Under these circumstances, any act that undermines the Fed’s independence could seriously damage the institutional framework upon which US economic strength rests.
The Fed has international credibility precisely because it is independent from any political master.
But the Fed also has legitimacy, because it is accountable to the government and to the people.
That accountability is, or at least should be, based on pre-established economic targets – namely, low inflation and unemployment – rather than on the political whims of whoever is in power at a given moment.
From this perspective, Trump could seriously damage the Fed’s credibility.
He need only appoint political loyalists instead of the best available technocrats; or appoint competent technocrats whom he has cajoled into professing personal loyalty to him, rather than to their mandates as Fed governors.
A Fed dominated by Trump acolytes might prioritize economic growth over other objectives, such as maintaining financial stability and low inflation.
But while this approach may boost GDP growth for a brief period, it would hurt growth in the long run, by fueling inflation and financial-market instability.
Another danger is that Trump will get his wish for a weaker dollar – permanently.
Even the mere possibility of reduced faith in the dollar, alongside higher inflation, could push up interest rates, leading to larger budget deficits, lower growth, and an inflationary spiral.
If Trump does try to press the Fed into the service of his own political agenda, he could do irreparable harm to an institution that ensures financial stability, low and stable inflation, and sustainable growth.
Rather than putting “America first,” he would be undercutting the dollar’s status as the dominant global reserve currency, and clearing the way for others to fill its role in global financial markets.
Breaking Bannon
WASHINGTON, DC – The just-released book about Donald Trump and his dysfunctional presidency (Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House) has left much of Washington reeling.
Despite the White House’s constitutionally dubious threat to try to quash the book, the publication date was moved up four days.
But the bulk of Fire and Fury’s disclosures, though deeply disquieting, aren’t all that surprising.
It’s not yet clear how Michael Wolff, the book’s controversial author, obtained some of his information, but it must be assumed that he taped many of his interviews, particularly those used for the long conversations found throughout the book.
What Wolff has achieved is to get attributed quotes from high officials about how the president functions, or doesn’t.
But the book mostly tells us what most of political-journalistic Washington already knew: that Trump is unqualified to be president and that his White House is a high-risk area of inexperienced aides.
The only surprise is that more calamities haven’t occurred – at least not yet.
A good portion of what was released before the book’s publication concerns a battle between two of the most talkative, argumentative, self-regarding braggarts US politics has ever seen: Trump and his one-time chief strategist, Stephen Bannon.
In the summer of 2016, with his campaign lacking a leader, Trump made Bannon – a scruffy, scrappy former businessman who was then the executive chair of Breitbart News, a website preaching white nationalism – the campaign’s chief executive.
Bannon was full of big ideas about what a right-wing “populist” campaign would look like.
In many ways, however, Bannon’s ideal campaign closely resembled what Trump was already saying and doing: appealing to blue-collar workers by attacking immigration – for example, saying that he’d build “a big, beautiful wall” along the border with Mexico, for which the Mexicans would pay – and trade agreements that Trump alleged were unfair to the US.
These voters came to form the core of Trump’s base, and his success in wooing them, combined with Hillary Clinton’s stunning failure to do so, goes a long way toward explaining why he is president and she is not.
The problem for Trump is that the citizens he was wooing have never added up to a near-majority of voters.
His famous “base” is well under 40% of the public.
But Trump and Bannon apparently preferred not to think about that.
Trump is prone to taking out his frustrations on others – he is never to blame for his failures – and inevitably these landed on Bannon, who bragged more than was good for him about his power in the White House and asserted more than he should have.
Bannon was ousted from the administration and left in August.
Though he and Trump stayed in touch, in retrospect, an eventual falling out seems to have been inevitable.
Trump and Bannon were like two overweight men trying to share a single sleeping bag.
Their political world wasn’t big enough for both.
They disagreed bitterly over whom to back in the race to fill a Senate seat from Alabama; but, at Bannon’s urging, Trump ultimately backed the erratic former state Supreme Court judge Roy Moore, who’d been removed from the bench twice, and who lost the race.
Bannon was seeking to shake up the Republican “establishment” by backing similar “outsider” candidates in this year’s midterm elections, which, if successful, could make it all the harder for Trump to obtain victories in Congress.
Despite his denials, it was Trump who more or less agreed to allow Wolff, whose reputation for slashing his subjects Trump presumably would have known from his years in New York City, to interview the White House staff for a book.
Some aides say they believed they were talking to Wolff “off the record,” meaning that they wouldn’t be publicly associated with their remarks.
But, even if that were true, it was hardly soothing to a furious president: they had said these things.
In Trump’s view, Bannon’s great sin with regard to Wolff’s book was to say highly negative things about the president’s family.
Trump was particularly infuriated by Bannon’s description of a now-famous meeting that his son, Donald Jr., and other senior campaign staff held in Trump Tower in June 2016 with some Russians who said that they had “dirt” on Hillary Clinton.
Bannon told Wolff that the meeting was “treasonous.”
But, depending on what actually transpired in that meeting, Bannon might not have been so far off.
(Trump himself participated in a meeting aboard Air Force One, as he returned from his second presidential trip abroad, to draft a statement to cover up what happened in that Trump Tower meeting.)
Trump was also reportedly furious that Bannon had described the president’s favorite child, Ivanka, as “dumb as a brick.”
Wolff also reports that Ivanka and her husband, White House senior adviser Jared Kushner, had agreed that after their expected smashing success at the White House, it would be Ivanka who would run for president.
Overstating matters, as is his wont, Trump claimed, in effect, that Bannon had had nothing to do with his election victory, and that the two had almost never talked one on one.
And, as is his wont, Trump threatened to sue Bannon.
Trump has a long track record of threatening lawsuits without ever filing them, but even the threat can be costly to the putative target.
Yet the momentary obsession with the feuding within the Trump camp shouldn’t obscure other realities.
Behind the drama, Trump has certain clear goals, and cabinet and agency heads who share them – and who don’t get distracted by the publication of a juicy account of the president’s behavior.
While much of Washington and its press corps were discussing the latest revelations, the Department of Justice, which is supposed to be somewhat independent of the White House, was being turned into a partisan instrument for pursuing the president’s grudges.
Indeed, last week, it was disclosed that the DoJ was reopening an investigation into the already thoroughly investigated matter of Hillary Clinton’s emails.
The FBI, it was also disclosed, would be looking into the Clinton Foundation.
The use of a government agency to punish a president’s previous opponent recalls the behavior for which Richard Nixon was impeached, and suggests a very different form of government than a democratic one.
Who Wants to Deregulate Finance?
LONDON – Since a revolving door was installed at the entrance to the West Wing of the White House, it has been difficult to keep track of the comings and goings in America’s corridors of power.
Anything written about the Trump administration’s personnel and policies may be invalid before it is published.
At least for the time being, however, the key economic-policy actors remain in place.
Steve Mnuchin is still Treasury Secretary and has not been mentioned in dispatches during the latest power struggles.
Gary Cohn continues to chair the National Economic Council, though he is reported to be unhappy about some of the president’s statements on non-economic issues.
And of course Janet Yellen is still at the helm at the Federal Reserve, at least until February next year.
But this stability does not seem to indicate a single settled view on economic and financial policy, particularly the future framework of financial regulation.
A remarkable recent interview in the Financial Times with Fed Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer laid bare some major disagreements.
Central bankers typically make a virtue of understatement and ambiguity.
Fed watchers need to analyze minute differences in wording and tone to identify shifts in thinking.
As Alan Greenspan famously told a Congressional committee, “if I turn out to be particularly clear, you have probably misunderstood what I said.”
So the language used on this occasion by Fischer, normally the mildest and most courteous of men, should cause us to sit up and take notice.
He argued that the United States’ political system “may be taking us in a direction that is very dangerous.”
Referring to moves to roll back elements of the new regulatory order established in response to the debacles of 2008-9, he lamented that “everybody wants to go back to the status quo before the great financial crisis.”
And he declared that “one cannot understand why grown intelligent people reach the conclusion that you should get rid of all the things you have put in place in the last ten years.”
This is remarkable language, which merits deconstruction.
Fischer cannot possibly mean literally that “everybody” wants to return to the status quo ante.
The academic community is mainly in favor of even tighter regulation of banks, with higher capital requirements.
With few exceptions, the press is even more hawkish.
Furthermore, I do not know a single bank chairman who thinks that going back to leverage ratios above 40, and tier 1 capital of 2%, would make any sense at all.
So who is “everybody” in this formulation?
The phrase reminds me of my mother’s frequent observation that “somebody,” unnamed, had not tidied his bedroom (I was an only child).
But here the suspect is not so obvious.
The only concrete proposals to emerge from the administration so far are in a thoughtful paper published in June by the US Treasury.
It is true that the paper’s title, “A Financial System that Creates Economic Opportunities,” has a political flavor; but the specific ideas it floats are not exactly those found on the wilder shores where “free banking” advocates roam.
The authors of the paper – which was signed by Mnuchin himself – want to reform the complex, incoherent, and overlapping patchwork of regulatory agencies left in place since the crisis.
Former Fed Chair Paul Volcker, hardly a lobbyist for investment banks, has been making the same argument for some time.
The paper also recommends some rationalization of the extremely complex rule books, relieving some simpler banks of the most burdensome and costly processes, and reducing the number of required regulatory submissions and stress test exercises.
One can argue about the details, but, overall, this does not look like a return to a pre-crisis free-for-all.
There is no suggestion in the paper that capital requirements should be significantly lowered, though it does recommend that the capital surcharge for systemically important banks should be “reevaluated.”
The one worrying section, for a non-US reader, concerns international standards, which should be accepted and implemented only if they “meet the needs of the US financial system and the American people.”
Exactly how the latter will be consulted on the calibration of risk weights in the Basel accord is not spelled out.
It is, nonetheless, hard to see why this document should have so rudely disturbed Fischer’s equipoise.
Perhaps he was giving us a glimpse of more fundamental disagreements on financial regulation at the heart of the administration.
Or perhaps the Fed itself fears that regulatory rationalization is code for some cutback in its own responsibilities, which have been expanded remarkably since the crisis.
It would be unfortunate if the Fed’s opposition to change prevented a debate on whether, ten years on, every one of the changes made – often in a tearing hurry – make sense, both individually and collectively.
After all, many changes in the competitive environment within which banks operate – new payment systems, peer-to-peer lenders, shadow banks, and the rest – require careful analysis and thought.
So the US Treasury is surely right to open a debate.
And it has done so in a thoughtful fashion.
Central bankers should take care not to suggest that there is nothing to discuss, that nanny knows best and the children should not ask awkward questions, like “Why?”
That was never a good way to persuade a teenage boy to keep his room tidy.
It will not work for lawmakers or banks, either.
The Trump Deficit
CAMBRIDGE – It is a post-financial-crisis myth that austerity-minded conservative governments always favor fiscal prudence, while redistribution-oriented progressives view large deficits as the world’s biggest free lunch.
This simplistic perspective, while perhaps containing a grain of truth, badly misses the true underlying political economy of deficits.
The fact is that whenever one party has firm control of government, it has a powerful incentive to borrow to finance its priorities, knowing that it won’t necessarily be the one to foot the bill.
So expect US President-elect Donald Trump’s administration, conservative or not, to make aggressive use of budget deficits to fund its priorities for taxes and spending.
The most accurate framework for thinking about government budget deficits in democracies was proposed in the late 1980s by the Italian scholars Alberto Alesina and Guido Tabellini, more or less simultaneously with two Swedes, Torsten Persson and Lars Svensson.
While their approaches differ slightly in detail, the basic idea is the same: You give money to your friends while you can.
If there is less money to go around later, when the opposition party gets its turn in power, well, that’s just too bad.
One only has to recall recent US economic history to confirm the insight of the Italian/Swedish model – and to see the absurdity of claims that Republicans always aim to balance the budget while Democrats always try to spend beyond the country’s means.
Back in the 1980s, conservative hero Ronald Reagan was willing to tolerate enormous deficits to fund his ambitious tax-cutting plans, and he did so in an era when borrowing wasn’t cheap.
In the early 2000s, another Republican president, George W. Bush, essentially followed Reagan’s playbook, again slashing taxes and sending deficits soaring.
In 2012, at the height of the standoff between the Republican-controlled Congress and Democratic President Barack Obama over deficits and the national debt, Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney proffered an economic plan that featured eye-popping deficits to finance tax cuts and higher military spending.
On the other side of spectrum, Democratic President Bill Clinton, during what most academic economists consider to have been an extremely successful presidency, actually put the government into surplus.
Indeed, at the end of the 1990s, some researchers actually wondered how international markets would function if the US government gradually retired all of its debt.
Bush’s subsequent tax cuts and unfunded wars ensured that this never became a problem.
What, then, prevents deficits from spiraling upward as parties alternate power and borrow to help their supporters?
In high-functioning democracies such as the United States or the United Kingdom, there is enough collective memory of the problems caused by high debt to allow some support for periodic reduction of debt/GDP ratios.
But even in the US and the UK, budget deficits are not sterile and neutral forms of economic stimulus, as in the classroom Keynesian model.
Instead, deficits are almost always the product of fierce political infighting over fiscal priorities.
Of course, in a constantly changing world, the costs of carrying a large debt burden can shift over time.
After falling for decades, interest rates are suddenly starting to rise.
Different attitudes toward risk are a central factor in the perennial controversy over how much stimulus is optimal.
Until recently, many left-leaning economic commentators have been arguing for massive fiscal stimulus in the US, though they seem to have changed their position overnight (the night Trump was elected, to be precise).
No one quite knows what a reasonable middle ground between debt and stimulus would be.
The Nobel laureate economist Thomas Sargent and others recently argued that the optimal level of debt for the US is in fact very close to zero, though he does not recommend trying to get there anytime soon, given that US government debt is now over 100% of GDP.
Sargent’s recommendation contradicts the view (espoused most recently in an Economist magazine leader) that instead of stabilizing debt, all advanced countries should be aiming to emulate Japan (where net debt is more than 140% of GDP, the highest ratio among the advanced economies).
What matters is not only the level of debt, but also how it is managed – a question I examined in a recent commentary focusing on the right mix of long-term and short-term government borrowing.
Some, including Robert Skidelsky, seem to think that discussion of how the maturity structure of government debt should be managed is somehow a stalking horse for tight budgets and austerity.
But if interest rates shoot up in the Trump era (as well they could), the US government will wish that it had opted for less short-term borrowing and more long-term borrowing.
If a Trump presidency does entail massive borrowing – along with faster growth and higher inflation – a sharp rise in global interest rates could easily follow, putting massive pressure on weak points around the world (for example, Italian public borrowing) and on corporate borrowing in emerging markets.
Many countries will benefit from US growth (if Trump does not simultaneously erect trade barriers).
But anyone counting on interest rates staying low because conservative governments are averse to deficits needs a history lesson.
Trump’s Unrealpolitik
NEW YORK – Some in the United States have praised President-elect Donald Trump for his supposed realism.
He will do what is right for America, they argue, without getting caught up in thorny moral dilemmas, or letting himself be carried away by some grand sense of responsibility for the rest of the world.
By acting with the shrewd pragmatism of a businessman, he will make America stronger and more prosperous.
This view is, to be frank, delusional.
It is certainly true that Trump will not be caught up in questions of morality.
He is precisely what the Greek historian Thucydides defined as an immoral leader: one of “violent character” who “wins over the people by deceiving them” and by exploiting “their angry feelings and emotions.”
But immorality is neither desirable nor a necessary feature of realism.
(Thucydides himself was an ethical realist.)
And there is little to suggest that Trump has any of the other realist qualities that his supporters see.
How could anyone expect the proudly unpredictable and deeply uninformed Trump to execute grand strategic designs, such as the Realpolitik recommended by Harvard’s Niall Ferguson, Henry Kissinger’s biographer, following the election?
Ferguson, like Kissinger, believes that true Realpolitik under Trump should begin with an alliance among the US, China, and Russia, based on a mutual fear of Islamic extremism and a shared desire to exploit lesser powers to boost their own economies.
These countries would agree to prevent Europe from attaining great-power status (by destroying the European Union), and to ensure that populist or authoritarian governments control the United Nations Security Council’s five permanent members.
To this end, Trump could work with Russian President Vladimir Putin to help Marine Le Pen, the leader of France’s anti-EU nationalist right, win April’s presidential election.
Moreover, in order to consolidate a post-EU Anglo-Atlantic sphere, Trump could transform the North American Free-Trade Agreement into a North Atlantic arrangement, replacing Mexico with the United Kingdom.
Finally, he could put pressure on NATO members to pay more for defense – a move that would surely undermine the security of the Baltic states and Ukraine.
Achieving these goals would require more than an ability to avoid moral impediments.
Like all statecraft, it would require an aptitude for careful diplomatic engineering, respect for facts and truth, historical knowledge, and a capacity for cautious examination of complex situations when formulating (or revising) policies.
Yet Trump is the most anarchic, capricious, and inconsistent individual ever to occupy the White House, and all he has to help guide him is a cabinet full of billionaire deal-makers like him, preoccupied with calculable immediate interests.
For them, casting off allies might seem like an easy way to streamline decision-making (and boost share prices).
But repudiating America’s role as a global beacon – and thus the idea of American exceptionalism – is a bad bet for the future.
Scrapping free-trade deals with Asia and Latin America, for example, could provide a short-term gain for the US economy; but doing so would ultimately undercut the projection of American power there, paving the way for penetration by China.
The US should be aiming to curtail China’s influence without incurring its wrath.
Another lesson from Thucydides – reinforced by historical experience – is that rising, not established, powers tend to upset the international order.
Protecting that order requires the main global power to uphold the institutions that underpin it, in order to prevent revolutionary behavior by lesser powers.
Yet Trump has criticized and disregarded international institutions to such an extent that it is now China that is defending global governance – including the Paris agreement on climate change and the nuclear deal with Iran – from a revolutionary US.
Worse, Trump has seemingly abandoned all caution with regard to China.
On the diplomatic front, by speaking directly with the president of Taiwan after the election, he violated a protocol maintained for four decades, by Democratic and Republican presidents alike.
On the economic front, he has leveled reckless (and plainly wrong) accusations that China is manipulating its currency to gain an unfair trade advantage.
Provoking China, doubting NATO, and threatening trade wars is nihilism, not strategy.
At this point, Trump seems set to do on a global scale what former President George W. Bush did to the Middle East – intentionally destabilize the old order, and then fail to create a new one.
The first step would be a deal with Putin on Syria – a move that, like Bush’s defeat of Saddam Hussein in Iraq, would amount to handing a victory to Iran.
This is not to say that none of the Realpolitik envisioned by Ferguson will come to fruition.
But what elements of it do emerge will likely be driven more by Putin than by Trump – with dangerous outcomes.
Already, Putin has begun work on dismantling the EU.
After Le Pen was refused credit from French banks, Russian banks saved her campaign.
And Russian state-sponsored propaganda is helping to drive former Soviet republics away from the EU.
Trump, a vocal Putin fan, is unlikely to redress the tilting balance of power as part of, let alone as a condition for, a diplomatic “reset” with Russia.
What kind of a realist would not use a united Western alliance to limit a Russia that is trying to engineer a return to Cold War spheres of influence?
And, for that matter, what kind of a realist sends to Israel an ambassador whose pro-settlement rhetoric threatens to inflame the entire Muslim world against the US?
What is so realistic about a war of annihilation against the Islamic State that is not backed by a plan for engagement with the broader Middle East?
Trump might have some realistic instincts.
But they will not be enough to ensure measured responses to even the slightest provocation, much less to underpin a sweeping and consistent strategy.
The Global Leadership Vacuum
MADRID – Germany and China are chief among the countries whose economic policies have drawn US President Donald Trump’s ire.
While the United States has the largest current-account deficit in the world, Germany and China are running the largest surpluses, and that irritates Trump and his advisers to no end.
Trump’s top trade adviser, Peter Navarro, insists that China is suppressing the value of its currency, the renminbi.
More surprisingly, Navarro has also accused Germany, an American ally, of “exploiting” the US and its European partners through an undervalued euro.
Most economists agree that Navarro’s accusations are largely unfounded.
Trump himself has flip-flopped on these issues, contradicting Navarro on occasion, even as he remains openly suspicious of US trade partners’ policies generally.
Since Trump was elected last year, Germany and China have also been chief among the countries expected to supplant US global leadership.
But Germany and China are profoundly different, and there is no consensus on whether either country can or will fill America’s shoes.
In a case of curious timing, both German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Chinese President Xi Jinping are approaching domestic political events that are widely expected to solidify their leadership positions in the coming years.
In Germany, Merkel is favored to win a fourth term as chancellor in the upcoming federal election on September 24.
A victory will put her on track to match Helmut Kohl’s 16 years in office – a tenure exceeded only by Otto von Bismarck.
Campaign-season debates in Germany have centered on Merkel’s “open doors” policy in response to the refugee crisis in 2015.
Merkel’s welcoming of refugees has exposed her to ferocious attacks – including from Trump himself – and energized the German far right, which, through the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, will probably elect representatives to the Bundestag for the first time since World War II.
Fortunately for Merkel, her relentless defense of humanitarian values does not seem to have cost her much support among those who voted for her previously.
She and her party, the Christian Democratic Union, experienced a backlash in polls and state elections after the summer of 2015, but that storm has blown over.
In fact, Merkel’s refugee policy has actually reinforced her popularity among younger voters.
Toward the end of the twentieth century, former US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright defined the US as the “indispensable nation.”
Now, almost 20 years later, The Economist magazine has deemed Merkel the “indispensable European.”
But as Merkel herself has warned, it would be “grotesque and absurd” to expect that she could carry the standard of liberal internationalism.
Germany, owing to its history, is reticent about reclaiming a leading role on the world stage.
But at the European level, Merkel can and should use a fourth term to establish an international legacy that measures up to her political stature.
With the election behind her, and with a potential partner in French President Emmanuel Macron, she will have a prime opportunity to pursue measures to rebalance and strengthen the European Union.
Meanwhile, Xi’s legacy is also at stake.
In mid-October, China’s political elite will convene for the 19th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), an event that will inevitably center on Xi.
As of last year, Xi has been officially declared the “core leader” of the CCP, a designation that his predecessor, Hu Jintao, never achieved.
At the Congress, CCP delegates will elect a new Central Committee, which will then fill the highest positions in the Party.
Xi’s reelection as CCP General Secretary is seen as a fait accompli, and most analysts expect that he will continue to surround himself with faithful allies and oust potential rivals, as he has already done through a much-publicized anticorruption campaign.
In 2015, Wang Qishan, Xi’s right-hand man who has been leading the anticorruption campaign, raised the question of the CCP’s “legitimacy” in a statement that previously would have been taboo.
With China’s economy slowing down in recent years, the CCP knows that it can no longer rely on growth alone to guarantee its political standing in the eyes of ordinary Chinese.
Xi’s anticorruption campaign is a central component of the CCP’s new legitimizing narrative.
So, too, is nationalism, which the CCP has been fostering through a highly visible and more assertive foreign policy.
According to CCP tradition, Xi’s second five-year term should also be his last.
But whether he will use his newly secured position to push for ambitious economic reforms remains to be seen.
His role within China after 2022 is also not yet known.
On the foreign-policy front, Xi has signaled that he might be ready to fill the leadership vacuum created by Trump’s “America First” approach.
But China cannot hope to replace the US unless it vastly increases its “soft power” and cultivates alliances and partnerships that it currently lacks.
The CCP’s stoking of Chinese nationalism does not make either of those tasks any easier.
The ongoing North Korea crisis implies that the US-China relationship during the Trump-Xi era will be one of intense strategic competition.
Will other actors, such as Merkel’s Germany or the EU as a whole, step in to ensure that great-power cooperation does not deteriorate beyond a point of no return?
The answer to that question will likely determine whether the international order retains any order to speak of in the years ahead.
Trump’s 3% Growth for the 1%
CAMBRIDGE – US President Donald Trump has boasted that his policies will produce sustained 3-4% growth for many years to come.
His prediction flies in the face of the judgment of many professional forecasters, including on Wall Street and at the Federal Reserve, who expect that the US will be lucky to achieve even 2% growth.
But is there any chance that Trump might be right?
And if he is, to what extent will his policies be responsible, and will faster growth entail grave long-term costs to the environment and income inequality?
The stock market may care only about the growth rate, but most Americans should be very concerned about how growth is achieved.
Trump’s forecast for the United States’ overall economic-growth rate is hardly wild-eyed.
A steady stream of economic data suggests that the annual rate has now accelerated to 2.5%, roughly splitting the difference between Trump and the experts.
Moreover, employment gains have been robust during the first six months of Trump’s presidency, with more than a million jobs created, and stocks are soaring to new highs, both of which are fueling higher consumption.
Given this performance, getting to 3% annual growth would hardly be a miracle.
And achieving Trump’s target would be even more likely if his administration suddenly became more coherent (which could indeed require a miracle).
Of course, growth this year is in many ways a continuation of that achieved during Barack Obama’s presidency.
Altering the course of a giant ship – in this case, the US economy – takes a long time, and even if Trump ever does manage to get some of his economic agenda through the US Congress, the growth effects are not likely to be felt until well into 2018.
To be sure, Trump has eviscerated the Environmental Protection Agency (which has helped coal mining), softened financial oversight (great for bank stocks), and has shown little interest in anti-trust enforcement (a welcome development for tech monopolies like Amazon and Google).
But his main policy initiatives for corporate tax reform and infrastructure spending remain on the drawing board.
Moreover, Trump’s plans to increase protectionism and sharply reduce immigration, if realized, would both have significant adverse effects on growth (though, to be fair, the proposal to have the composition of immigration more closely match the economy’s needs is what most countries, including Canada and Australia, already do).
Perhaps the single most important decision Trump will make on the economy will be his choice of who should replace Janet Yellen as Chair of the Federal Reserve Board.
In other appointments, Trump has preferred generals and businesspeople to technocrats.
By and large, the most successful bankers in recent years have been exactly the types of experts Trump seems to avoid.
Whoever Trump appoints is likely to face major challenges immediately.
Subdued wage growth in the face of a tightening labor market is unlikely to continue, and any big rise in wages will put strong upward pressure on prices (though this might not happen anytime soon, given the relentless downward pressure on wages coming from automation and globalization).
How the Fed handles an eventual transition to higher wage growth will be critical.
If policymakers raise interest rates too briskly, the result will be recession.
If they raise rates too slowly, inflation could become uncomfortably high and ingrained.
So, yes, Trump just might get his growth number, especially if he finds a way to normalize economic policymaking (which is highly uncertain for a president who seems to prefer tweet storms to patient policy analysis).
But even if the US hits the 3% target, it might not be the panacea the Trump hopes it will be.
For starters, faster growth is unlikely to reverse the current trend toward inequality, and a few small, targeted presidential interventions into the actions of specific states or companies are hardly going to change that.
On the contrary, there is no reason to presume that owners of capital will not continue to be the main beneficiaries.
Eventually, that trend could reverse, but I wouldn’t bet on it happening just yet.
If environmental degradation and rising inequality make economic growth such a mixed blessing, is the US government wrong to focus on it so much? Not entirely.
Higher growth rates are particularly good for smaller businesses and startups, which in turn are a major contributor to economic mobility.
Recent low growth rates have made potential entrepreneurs far more reluctant to move across states or to change jobs, and have reduced economic mobility in general.
And if the US economy were to weaken substantially for a prolonged period, it could bring forward considerably the day when the US no longer has significant military superiority over its rivals.
Those who, like Trump, want to reduce US military involvement overseas may argue that this is nothing to worry about, but they are wrong.
Still, policies that produced more broadly shared and environmentally sustainable growth would be far better than policies that perpetuate current distributional trends and exacerbate many Americans’ woes.
Even if Trump hits his growth targets in 2018 and 2019 – and he just might – only the stock market may be cheering.
Trump’s Alternative Ethical Universe
LONDON – From the moment Donald Trump entered the US presidential race, the potential for an unprecedented array of ethics violations, stemming from his global business interests, has been a ticking time bomb, set to detonate on January 20, 2017.
Boom.
Plenty of other liberal democracies have experienced elements of authoritarian leadership, including nepotism, limits on freedom of speech or of the press, overtly discriminatory policies, and the abuse of public office for personal gain.
But the United States has mostly avoided these traps, owing largely to term limits and a reliable system of checks and balances.
Enter Trump.
Upon assuming a powerful position, no effective leader – in government, business, or anywhere else – publicly excoriates future staff; lashes out in response to any and all criticism; disparages highly regarded public figures; or refuses to learn about the issues he or she will have to address.
Trump has done all of this and more.
Trump’s transition team sent surveys to the US Department of Energy, seeking the names of employees who have worked on climate-change policy.
He has offered a key White House role to his son-in-law, Jared Kushner.
And he has consistently refused intelligence briefings, dismissed the concerns of the intelligence community about Russian meddling in the election, and even likened the release of information about those concerns to Nazi Germany.
Of course, Trump’s distrust of experts is far from unique nowadays.
But using experts’ missteps or uncertainties to justify disregarding facts is irresponsible.
For the US president – a person tasked with serving and protecting people all over the world – it’s downright dangerous.
The danger is all the more acute when the president is taking advantage of skepticism about facts to manipulate perceptions and create space for his own unethical behavior.
Trump has claimed that he will disentangle himself from his business to avoid conflicts of interests, while offering no credible plan for doing so.
Trump’s team has been consistent about little except its insistence on the notion that being powerful is equivalent to being right.
When asked about Trump’s behavior, Kellyanne Conway, Trump’s campaign manager and now a White House counselor, replied, “He’s the president-elect, so that’s presidential behavior.”
Trump himself has responded to questions about his campaign rhetoric with a simple “I won.”
Congressional Republicans seem to be on board with this demagogic approach.
The party’s caucus in the House of Representatives made it their order of business to try to gut an independent ethics committee established in the wake of scandals a decade ago.
The backlash was swift, and they had to back off.
But they may yet try again: Trump criticized the move, but only its timing, and called the ethics committee “unfair.”
The attack on ethics does not end there.
Senate Republicans have pushed forward confirmation hearings for Trump’s cabinet picks, even though proper vetting and financial disclosures have not yet taken place.
Efforts have been made to counter – or, at least, highlight – the ethics violations that Trump and his team are accumulating.
Walter Shaub, Director of the independent Office of Government Ethics, which was established after Watergate, spoke out on the subject.
(Trump’s chief of staff responded with a veiled threat, warning the director to “be careful.”)
The Washington Post has created a new team devoted specifically to covering conflicts of interest within the Trump administration and possible violations of the Emoluments Clause of the US Constitution, which prohibits anyone holding public office from accepting money or gifts from foreign officials.
But, for now, Trump and his enablers seem committed to continuing down their current path – an approach that is already weakening America’s moral authority.
While many world leaders are concerned about Trump’s behavior, many others are probably thinking that they now have tacit permission to do likewise.
Business leaders, too, may conclude that they can flout ethical rules.
This logic, while understandable, is flawed.
Trump won’t be US president forever.
Right-wing populist movements like his will eventually tear themselves apart, not least because their leaders are not committed to policies that will actually help their constituents.
On the contrary, Trump and congressional Republicans are moving fast to dismantle the Affordable Care Act – President Barack Obama’s signature health-care policy – claiming that its as-yet-undefined replacement will maintain the popular elements and drop the unpopular ones.
In reality, this will be impossible.
Those who take advantage of the current ethical fugue for personal or shareholder gain will have to answer for it when the political pendulum swings back to sanity.
So will those who, while not jumping aboard the venality train themselves, hold the doors open for others, by failing to defend ethical standards.
Politicians and businesspeople must now decide whether they will be known as opportunists and enablers or as true leaders, adhering to the ethics and principles that they have publicly espoused.
The World Economic Forum Annual Meeting in Davos, Switzerland, which focused on “responsible and responsive leadership,” presented an early opportunity to draw a line in the sand.
In the future, those who remained on the right side of it will be glad they did.
Don’t Cry for Corporate America
NEW HAVEN – Corporate tax cuts are coming in the United States.
While this push pre-dates last November’s presidential election, President Donald Trump’s Make-America-Great-Again mantra has sealed the deal.
Beleaguered US businesses, goes the argument, are being squeezed by confiscatory taxes and onerous regulations – strangling corporate earnings and putting unrelenting pressure on capital spending, job creation, and productivity, while sapping America’s competitive vitality.
Apparently, the time has come to give businesses a break.
But this argument raises an obvious question: If the problem is so simple, why hasn’t this fix already been tried?
The answer is surprising.
For starters, it is a real stretch to bemoan the state of corporate earnings in the US.
Commerce Department statistics show that after-tax corporate profits (technically, after-tax profits from current production, adjusted for inventory and depreciation-accounting distortions) stood at a solid 9.7% of national income in the third quarter of 2016.
While that is down from the 11% peak hit in 2012 – owing to tepid economic growth, which typically puts pressure on profit margins – it hardly attests to a chronic earnings problem.
Far from anemic, the current GDP share of after-tax profits is well above the post-1980 average of 7.6%.
Trends in corporate taxes, which stood at just 3.5% of national income in the third quarter of 2016, support a similar verdict.
Yes, the figure is higher than the post-2000 level of 3% (which represents the lowest 15-year average tax burden for corporate America since the 2.9% reading in the mid-1990s); but it is well below the 5.2% average share recorded during the boom years of the post-World War II era, from 1950 to 1969.
In other words, while there may be reason to criticize the structure and complexities of the US corporate tax burden, there is little to suggest that overall corporate taxes are excessive.
Conversely, the share of national income going to labor has been declining.
In the third quarter of 2016, worker compensation – wages, salaries, fringe benefits, and other so-called supplements such as social security, pension contributions, and medical benefits – stood at 62.6% of national income.
While that represents a bit of a rebound from the 61.2% low recorded in the 2012-2014 period, it is two percentage points below the post-1980 average of 64.6%.
In other words, the pendulum of economic returns has swung decisively away from labor toward owners of capital – not exactly a compelling argument in favor of relief for purportedly hard-pressed American businesses.
But what about the seemingly chronic weakness in capital spending and job creation, widely thought to be additional manifestations of overly burdened US companies?
Yes, both business investment and employment growth have been glaring weak spots in the current recovery. There is a distinct possibility, however, that this is due less to onerous taxes and regulatory strangulation, and more to an unprecedented shortfall of aggregate demand.
Economists long ago settled the debate over what drives business capital spending: factors affecting the cost of capital (interest rates, taxes, and regulations) or those that influence future demand.
The demand-driven models (operating through so-called “accelerator” effects) won hands down.
This is logical.
Businesses can be expected to expand capacity and hire workers only if they anticipate that their markets will grow in the future.
For the US, that may also be a stretch.
Since the first quarter of 2008, inflation-adjusted personal consumption expenditures in the US have grown by just 1.6% annually, on average – fully two percentage points below the 3.6% norm in the 12 preceding years.
In fact, the current period is the weakest 35 quarters of real consumption growth in post-WWII history.
If past is prologue – as it is for many businesses as they frame their expectations – the focus on tax relief and deregulation could ring hollow, without addressing weak consumer demand.
It’s the same story with competitiveness.
Trump repeatedly bemoans the loss of America’s once-dominant competitive position.
To restore it, Trump’s “America first” campaign is framed around an explicit endorsement of protectionism, underscored by the haunting words of his inaugural address: “Protection will lead to great prosperity and strength.”
But Trump’s narrative of a once-great America that has supposedly lost its competitive edge is at odds with the best available evidence: an annual compendium published by the World Economic Forum (WEF), which provides a detailed assessment of 114 individual competitive metrics for some 138 countries.
In the WEF’s 2016-17 Global Competiveness Report, the US came in third in terms of overall international competitiveness (behind Switzerland and Singapore) – maintaining pretty much the same position it has held over the past decade.
Yes, the US scores poorly on corporate tax rates, regulation, and government bureaucracy; but it more than compensates for those shortcomings with exceedingly high rankings for capacity for innovation (2/138), company spending on research and development (2/138), and availability of scientists and engineers (2/138).
Impressive scores on financial-market development, labor-market efficiency, and several aspects of business sophistication are also big pluses for America’s consistently high rankings in the WEF’s global tally.
In short, the US has hardly lost its competitive edge.
In an ideal world, it would be nice to streamline, simplify, and even reduce tax and regulatory burdens on US businesses.
But business is not the weak link in the US economic chain; workers are far more vulnerable.
Economic returns have shifted dramatically from the providers of labor to the owners of capital over the past 25 years.
That, more than anything, speaks to the need for an urgent reordering of the priorities in America’s national economic-policy debate.
The Dangers of Nuclear Bombast
MADRID – In the summer of 2012, the international relations theorist Kenneth N. Waltz published an article titled “Why Iran Should Get the Bomb,” in which he argued that a nuclear-armed Iran would reestablish a desirable balance of power in the Middle East, by acting as a counterweight to Israel.
Later that year, Waltz also argued that the strategy of combining sanctions with diplomacy was unlikely to dissuade Iran from developing its nuclear capacity.
“Short of using military force,” he wrote in Foreign Affairs in September 2012, “it is difficult to imagine how Iran could be prevented from acquiring nuclear weapons if it is determined to do so.”
Waltz was wrong in two ways.
First, by defending nuclear weapons as a source of regional or global stability, he profoundly underestimated the danger that they could fall into the hands of terrorists or be used because of a miscalculation.
Second, Waltz failed to foresee the success of the nuclear negotiations with Iran (or their “failure” from the perspective of those who actually wanted a nuclear-armed Iran).
Waltz died in 2013, but if he were alive today, he would undoubtedly point out the loose ends of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action that Iran, the P5+1 (the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, plus Germany), and the European Union adopted in 2015.
Yet he also would have to recognize that the JCPOA goes further than what he and many others had thought possible, demonstrating the power of diplomacy, especially to those who had advocated military means.
The JCPOA was a landmark of multilateralism.
Despite that – or, perhaps, because of his disregard for multilateralism in all forms – US President Donald Trump has called it the “stupidest deal of all time,” and predicted that it would “lead to a nuclear holocaust.”
Countless analysts, such as Stephen M. Walt of Harvard University, have shown these claims to be completely unfounded and hyperbolic in the extreme.
But that didn’t stop Trump from refusing in October to “recertify” the JCPOA.
Trump’s move leaves it up to the US Congress to decide whether to re-impose nuclear-related sanctions on Iran, which would amount to a violation of the agreement.
Even if Congress decides to do nothing on this front, Trump’s anti-Iran rhetoric and other Republican initiatives in Congress have strained the JCPOA and left it vulnerable.
The JCPOA’s collapse would generate significant risks for the Middle East and the world.
A newly restarted Iranian nuclear program would add a worrisome dimension to Iran’s strategic rivalry with Saudi Arabia.
In fact, the two countries’ cold war already seems to be heating up.
Saudi Arabia – whose audacious young crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, has Trump’s full support – recently accused Iran of an “act of war” after a missile was launched from Yemen toward Riyadh.
At a time when the US is already in a nuclear standoff with North Korea, the last thing it needs is to raise a similar risk in the Middle East.
Fortunately, Germany, China, France, the United Kingdom, Russia, and the EU have all committed to defending the JCPOA, distancing themselves from the Trump administration’s reluctant stance.
Trump’s foreign policy is adding to a long list of perverse incentives in the area of nuclear proliferation.
Consider the 2003 US-led invasion of Iraq, which was launched on the pretext that Saddam Hussein was hiding weapons of mass destruction.
He wasn’t.
And when he was brought down, the other two members of US President George W. Bush’s so-called axis of evil, Iran and North Korea, concluded that not having nuclear arms made them vulnerable to American attempts at regime change.
This conclusion was further reinforced in 2011, with the US-assisted overthrow of Libyan leader Muammar el-Qaddafi, who had abandoned his nuclear program eight years earlier.
In North Korea, Kim Jong-un came to power a few weeks after Qaddafi’s summary execution at the hands of rebel fighters, which undoubtedly influenced his approach to international relations.
Rather than making Kim back down, Trump’s threats of “fire and fury” have further convinced the North Korean leader that his survival and that of the Kim dynasty depend on nuclear weapons.
Punishingly tight sanctions alone will not change his mind.
Kim seems perfectly willing to subject the North Korean people to privations of every kind in order to remain in power.
Of course, there are notable differences between North Korea and Iran.
The most obvious is that Iran’s nuclear program did not take off, whereas North Korea – which, unlike Iran, withdrew from the Non-Proliferation Treaty – already has an estimated 60 nuclear warheads, and seems to be making progress toward a nuclear-tipped intercontinental ballistic missile capable of reaching the US mainland.
In short: an all-out military conflict with North Korea would entail immediate global risks.
Trump may have begun to realize that increasing pressure on North Korea does not preclude sitting down to negotiate with Kim.
In fact, combining both methods is the most sensible alternative.
But giving diplomacy a chance will require Trump to abandon his incendiary rhetoric and maximalist positions, and work constructively with Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Having recently consolidated his power at the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, Xi will probably assume a more proactive role in international conflict resolution, especially in areas that affect China directly.
An effective global leader must be able to confront his ally and offer a hand to his adversary when circumstances call for it.
Finding a strategy that credibly contains the North Korean threat is the only way to ensure that South Korea and Japan do not make the regrettable choice of joining the nuclear club.
As Waltz observed, nuclear arms have a tendency to spread.
But that does not mean we should resign ourselves to proliferation, let alone play down its catastrophic potential.
International security depends on preserving diplomatic success stories such as the JCPOA, which are crucial to avoid contagion and to put an end, once and for all, to dangerous spirals of antagonism and polarization.
“America First” and Global Conflict Next
NEW YORK – Donald Trump’s election as President of the United States does not just represent a mounting populist backlash against globalization. It may also portend the end of Pax Americana – the international order of free exchange and shared security that the US and its allies built after World War II.
That US-led global order has enabled 70 years of prosperity.
It rests on market-oriented regimes of trade liberalization, increased capital mobility, and appropriate social-welfare policies; backed by American security guarantees in Europe, the Middle East, and Asia, through NATO and various other alliances.
Trump, however, may pursue populist, anti-globalization, and protectionist policies that hinder trade and restrict the movement of labor and capital.
And he has cast doubt on existing US security guarantees by suggesting that he will force America’s allies to pay for more of their own defense.
If Trump is serious about putting “America first,” his administration will shift US geopolitical strategy toward isolationism and unilateralism, pursuing only the national interests of the homeland.
When the US pursued similar policies in the 1920s and 1930s, it helped sow the seeds of World War II.
Protectionism – starting with the Smoot-Hawley Tariff, which affected thousands of imported goods – triggered retaliatory trade and currency wars that worsened the Great Depression.
More important, American isolationism – based on a false belief that the US was safely protected by two oceans – allowed Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan to wage aggressive war and threaten the entire world.
With the attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, the US was finally forced to take its head out of the sand.
Today, too, a US turn to isolationism and the pursuit of strictly US national interests may eventually lead to a global conflict.
Even without the prospect of American disengagement from Europe, the European Union and the eurozone already appear to be disintegrating, particularly in the wake of the United Kingdom’s June Brexit vote and Italy’s failed referendum on constitutional reforms in December.
Moreover, in 2017, extreme anti-Europe left- or right-wing populist parties could come to power in France and Italy, and possibly in other parts of Europe.
Without active US engagement in Europe, an aggressively revanchist Russia will step in.
Russia is already challenging the US and the EU in Ukraine, Syria, the Baltics, and the Balkans, and it may capitalize on the EU’s looming collapse by reasserting its influence in the former Soviet bloc countries, and supporting pro-Russia movements within Europe.
If Europe gradually loses its US security umbrella, no one stands to benefit more than Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Trump’s proposals also threaten to exacerbate the situation in the Middle East.
He has said that he will make America energy independent, which entails abandoning US interests in the region and becoming more reliant on domestically produced greenhouse-gas-emitting fossil fuels.
And he has maintained his position that Islam itself, rather than just radical militant Islam, is dangerous.
This view, shared by Trump’s incoming National Security Adviser, General Michael Flynn, plays directly into Islamist militants’ own narrative of a clash of civilizations.
Meanwhile, an “America first” approach under Trump will likely worsen the longstanding Sunni-Shia proxy wars between Saudi Arabia and Iran.
And if the US no longer guarantees its Sunni allies’ security, all regional powers – including Iran, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and Egypt – might decide that they can defend themselves only by acquiring nuclear weapons, and even more deadly conflict will ensue.
In Asia, US economic and military primacy has provided decades of stability; but a rising China is now challenging the status quo.
US President Barack Obama’s strategic “pivot” to Asia depended primarily on enacting the 12-country Trans-Pacific Partnership, which Trump has promised to scrap on his first day in office.
Meanwhile, China is quickly strengthening its own economic ties in Asia, the Pacific, and Latin America through its “one belt, one road” policy, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, the New Development Bank (formerly known as the BRICS bank), and its own regional free-trade proposal to rival the TPP.
If the US gives up on its Asian allies such as the Philippines, South Korea, and Taiwan, those countries may have no choice but to prostrate themselves before China; and other US allies, such as Japan and India, may be forced to militarize and challenge China openly.
Thus, an American withdrawal from the region could very well eventually precipitate a military conflict there.
As in the 1930s, when protectionist and isolationist US policies hampered global economic growth and trade, and created the conditions for rising revisionist powers to start a world war, similar policy impulses could set the stage for new powers to challenge and undermine the American-led international order.
An isolationist Trump administration may see the wide oceans to its east and west, and think that increasingly ambitious powers such as Russia, China, and Iran pose no direct threat to the homeland.
But the US is still a global economic and financial power in a deeply interconnected world.
If left unchecked, these countries will eventually be able to threaten core US economic and security interests – at home and abroad – especially if they expand their nuclear and cyberwarfare capacities.
The historical record is clear: protectionism, isolationism, and “America first” policies are a recipe for economic and military disaster.
The EU Must Recognize the Palestinian State
MADRID – Once again, US President Donald Trump has taken a unilateral approach to foreign policy – this time, by recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.
And once again, Trump has misinterpreted the realities of the Middle East.
Given that his latest move – which effectively blew up more than 70 years of international consensus – could precipitate a rapid deterioration in the region, it is imperative that the European Union step up.
The Trump administration’s Middle East policy rests on a reinvigorated alliance between the United States and Saudi Arabia.
Every American president since John F. Kennedy has made his first foreign visit either to Mexico, Canada, or Europe.
Not Trump.
He made a beeline to Riyadh, where he participated in a summit with 54 Muslim-majority countries and delivered an inflammatory speech vilifying Iran, which he asserted should be shunned by the international community.
After Saudi Arabia, Trump paid a visit to Israel, where he launched another fusillade of anti-Iran rhetoric.
Saudi Arabia and Israel do not maintain diplomatic relations, but they are both US allies, and they have a shared opponent in Iran.
In November, the head of the Israel Defense Forces, Lieutenant General Gadi Eisenkot, even expressed openness to sharing intelligence with Saudi Arabia to counter Iran.
“With President Trump,” Eisenkot told the Saudi publication Elaph, “there is an opportunity to build a new international coalition in the region.”
The Saudi-Israeli rapprochement has been helped along by Saudi Arabia’s new crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman (MBS), who is pursuing a program of modernization, both domestically and in foreign-policy terms.
Earlier this month, MBS was rumored to have proposed an Israeli-Palestinian peace plan that would have been highly favorable to Israel, although the US and Saudi governments have since denied those reports.
In any case, Trump has clearly wanted to take advantage of these circumstances to deliver a diplomatic coup.
And yet his decision on Jerusalem forces the Saudis to confront a dilemma: whether to place a higher priority on defending the Palestinian cause, or on normalizing ties with Israel as a means to contain Iran.
Some Saudis seem to hope for the latter, proposing to leave aside thorny questions about the status of Jerusalem and the Palestinians in general.
Trump, too, attempted to add nuance to his declaration, asserting that he was not taking a position on the specific geographical boundaries of Israeli sovereignty in Jerusalem, and that the US embassy would not be moved from Tel Aviv immediately.
But, as former US special envoy for the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations Martin Indyk put it, the Americans “can try to limit the damage all they want, but they won’t be able to, because Jerusalem is such a hot-button issue.”
That reality was reflected in the eruption of street protests across the Middle East soon after Trump’s announcement, though the large-scale violence that some feared has not occurred.
More telling, the Organization of Islamic Cooperation held an extraordinary summit in Istanbul, where its members reaffirmed “the centrality of the cause of Palestine and Al-Quds Al-Sharif [Jerusalem] to the Muslim Ummah,” recognized East Jerusalem as the capital of Palestine, and strongly condemned Trump’s actions.
No Muslim, it seems, is prepared to forget that Jerusalem is home to the Al-Aqsa mosque, the third most sacred site in Islam.
Saudi Arabia’s King Salman referred to the mosque when he warned Trump just how harmful the Jerusalem decision would be.
And when Trump announced the decision anyway, the Kingdom derided it as “unjustified” and “irresponsible.”
The simple truth is that Saudi Arabia cannot distance itself from the Palestinian cause and allow other countries like Turkey and even Iran to carry the banner.
That would amount to a tactical mistake akin to severing ties with Qatar a few months ago.
It would also be difficult, if not impossible, for the Saudis suddenly to support a plan that was radically different from the Arab Peace Initiative, known as the “Saudi Initiative,” which was approved in 2002 and endorsed by the Arab League this year.
So Trump’s dream scenario – in which Saudi Arabia sides with Israel to pressure the Palestinians to make peace – is not going to materialize.
First, Saudi Arabia is not in a position to waive Arab claims on Jerusalem.
Second, a strategy that gives the Palestinians no say in their fate, and the fate of Jerusalem, will never succeed.
And, third, Trump’s administration – including his son-in-law Jared Kushner, to whom Trump has entrusted the US role in the Arab-Israeli peace process – is staffed with businesspeople, not politicians, as Kushner himself recently pointed out.
But Jerusalem, and the Israel-Palestine conflict more broadly, is far too fraught to be treated like a business deal.
Though Trump has not ruled out the two-state solution – the approach endorsed by the United Nations – he may have put the final nail in its coffin.
The only way to save it, or even to get the Israelis and the Palestinians to return to the negotiating table, is to work toward a more level playing field.
Here, the EU must take the lead and send a message that is as forceful as it is necessary, by immediately recognizing – as over 70% of UN member states have already done – the State of Palestine.
The path toward a two-state solution should start with the Arab Peace Initiative, which stipulates that the Arab League would recognize Israel if it were to retreat into its pre-1967 borders, though an alternative, more gradual approach could be considered.
The two-state solution – which would allow Israel to retain its Jewish and democratic character, and should guarantee the viability of the Palestinian state – still represents the most credible way out of the Arab-Israeli quagmire.
But if we are to achieve the “separation because of respect” that Yitzhak Rabin envisioned in the 1990s, there is no time to lose: the point of no return is inching closer with each passing day.
Trump, to Jerusalem and Back
TEL AVIV – US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger famously singled out Israel as a country whose entire foreign policy is actually domestic.
Yet the same is true of the United States, particularly when it comes to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
All US presidents attempting to resolve that conflict have faced massive – indeed, insurmountable – domestic political obstacles.
With his recent decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, Donald Trump has taken this trend to the next level, though the result may well be more of the same stagnation.
Trump’s Jerusalem declaration is the latest manifestation of the unlikely president’s quest for domestic legitimacy, which has made him almost obsessed with fulfilling his extreme and self-defeating campaign promises, including withdrawal from or renegotiation of major international treaties such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Paris climate agreement.
Likewise, the Jerusalem decision was meant to appease the messianic dreams of his massive evangelical constituency.
Yet Trump’s actions have wider diplomatic implications, which he seems incapable of calculating.
Understandably, Trump’s declaration has been met with rage from Palestinians, with President Mahmoud Abbas asserting that “from now on” he would not accept “any role” for the US in the peace process, and even calling for the world to reconsider its recognition of Israel.
Moreover, anti-American powers – Hezbollah, Iran, Russia, and Turkey – have taken Trump’s divisive decision as an opportunity to enhance their own regional influence, at the expense of the US and its allies.
They hope to position themselves as the champions of a great Arab and Muslim cause supposedly betrayed by the feeble reaction of Israel’s newfound Arab friends, particularly Saudi Arabia.
This response won’t help the Palestinians any more than it will help the US.
Anger is not a strategy – a lesson that Palestinians have learned the hard way in the past.
Abbas is presumably also still waiting for the United Kingdom to apologize for the 1917 Balfour declaration, the centenary of which Israel recently celebrated.
The fact is that, despite being demoralized by years of futile “peace processes,” the Palestinian masses are in no mood for a third intifada.
And they blame their plight not just on the occupier, but also on their own unelected and utterly unpopular leaders, who offer them no sense of direction or achievable objectives.
The incendiary rhetoric of Palestine’s supporters in the Arab world has never done much for the Palestinian people, either.
Trump’s Jerusalem declaration is not “the beginning of the end of Israel,” as Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah, has promised.
Hezbollah is simply attempting to distract attention from its disgraceful war in support of Bashar al-Assad’s genocidal regime in Syria.
Likewise, by committing itself to the Palestinian “Islamic Resistance Forces,” Hezbollah’s patron, Iran, is simply recycling a policy that it has pursued since long before that declaration, with the goal of advancing its regional hegemonic designs.
And, in fact, while the move has probably reinforced Iran’s claim to be the true defender of Jerusalem and Palestine, the biggest gains for Iran will likely be emotional.
After all, the Sunni Middle East – led by a Saudi Arabia for which the quest for regional dominance amounts to a struggle for regime survival – will not accept being led by the rising Shia empire, especially if that means clashing head-on with Israel and the US.
Palestine also should not expect much from Russia.
President Vladimir Putin is a realist; he knows that heeding the call for Russia to assume a leadership role in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict would damage his relationships with both parties, without bringing them any closer to a settlement.
Russia’s calling is not – and has never been – that of a peacemaker.
So, in many ways, Trump’s Jerusalem declaration will not change much.
As the Palestinians and their friends in the international community might realize when the dust settles, it does not preclude the city’s eventual division into two capitals as part of a peace settlement, much less guarantee Israel sovereignty over all of Jerusalem as its “eternal capital.”
In fact, it is a fantasy to assume, as Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu seems to do, that Trump’s support is the key to getting the Palestinians and their Arab and Muslim supporters to acquiesce to Israeli-Jewish rule over a city that is so important to both sides.
Even Trump himself admitted the limits of Israel’s sovereignty in Jerusalem, and affirmed his commitment to the status quo regarding East Jerusalem’s holy sites.
Moreover, the restrained response of Arab leaders should not be interpreted as a vindication of Netanyahu’s assumption that his newfound allies in Saudi Arabia and Egypt could force the Palestinians into a US-brokered peace deal that would not meet the core requirements of their national narrative.
In any case, the days of Netanyahu’s expansionist government are numbered.
The clumsy Jerusalem declaration cannot save Netanyahu’s current coalition government from massive corruption scandals and irreconcilable internal conflicts.
Not even an Israel-friendly peace plan spearheaded by Trump (assuming his declaration does not foreclose it altogether) could do that.
Netanyahu’s right-wing coalition simply is no partner for a historic deal, on Jerusalem or on any other element of the dispute.
The only way forward is for Israel to produce a new, more centrist coalition, while the Palestinians adopt a more sober and strategic approach.
In that case, Trump’s Jerusalem declaration would not preclude a solution according to the peace parameters put forward by Bill Clinton.
And, in fact, when I led the Israeli negotiating team almost two decades ago, both sides accepted the idea of Jerusalem being partitioned, albeit with flexible borders, along ethnic lines.
To improve the chances of success, America’s monopoly on the Israeli-Palestinian peace process should end.
Instead, the negotiations should be handled more like those that produced the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, with a group of countries – in that case, the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council (China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the US), plus Germany – working together to achieve results.
Donald Trump Versus Mideast Peace
JERUSALEM – In a matter of three weeks, the United States government has attacked the Palestinian people on three fronts.
First, on November 17, President Donald Trump’s administration announced its decision (subsequently reversed) to close the Palestine Liberation Organization’s diplomatic office in Washington, DC.
Then, on December 5, the US Congress voted unanimously to adopt the Taylor Force Act, which blocks aid to the Palestinian Authority from 2018 to 2024, unless the PA stops paying monthly salaries and other benefits to the families of killed or convicted Palestinian militants.
But it was the third attack, which came the following day, that will prove most devastating to efforts to achieve peace.
In defiance of overwhelming global opposition, not to mention past United Nations General Assembly and Security Council resolutions, Trump announced that the US will officially recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.
The message is clear: the Trump administration is determined to dictate the Israeli version of peace with the Palestinians, rather than to mediate an equitable agreement between the two sides.
Of course, that is not how Trump’s administration presents it.
As the New York Times reported just before the announcement, Trump administration officials believe the decision, which entails moving the US embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, could actually hasten the peace process, “by removing a source of ambiguity from the American position.”
After all, they point out, the embassy question comes up every six months, when the president has to sign a new waiver to keep the embassy in Tel Aviv – a process that, from their perspective, repeatedly stokes political tension.
In his address on the topic, Trump reiterated this argument.
Officially recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, he asserted, “is a long-overdue step to advance the peace process and to work towards a lasting agreement.”
He also claimed that the decision “is not intended, in any way, to reflect a departure from our strong commitment to facilitate a lasting peace agreement,” one “that is a great deal for the Israelis and a great deal for the Palestinians.”
But, in that same speech, Trump betrayed the superiority he ascribes to Israel: “Israel is a sovereign nation with the right like every other sovereign nation to determine its own capital.”
Despite its best efforts, Palestine, of course, is not recognized as a sovereign state by the US.
So, far from seeking a fair peace deal between the two parties, Trump has effectively declared victory for Israel – and instructed the Palestinians to accept defeat quietly.
Yet the Palestinians have displayed a profound capacity for resistance.
Just last summer, when the Israeli government decided unilaterally to install metal detectors at the entrances of Al Haram Al Sharif/Al Aqsa Mosque, Palestinians demonstrated outside the mosque for two weeks, forcing the Israelis to reverse the decision.
Moving the US embassy to Jerusalem is a far more powerful symbolic move, suggesting that it could spur even more formidable resistance – and not just from the 300,000 Palestinians who live in East Jerusalem, or even from the more than 12 million Palestinians around the world.
What Trump’s administration fails to recognize is that Jerusalem – the third-holiest site in Islam, after Mecca and Medina – isn’t just an Israeli-Palestinian issue; all of the world’s 350 million Arabs and 1.5 billion Muslims have a direct and vital stake in it.
Trump may think that his current honeymoon with Saudi Arabia will allow him to escape pushback from Arab leaders.
But Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is facing too much opposition to his own reforms to side openly with Israel on so emotive an issue as Jerusalem.
The fact is that leaders across the Muslim and Arab world are not going to allow Trump to hand Jerusalem to Israel unilaterally, simply to satisfy his small base of US Christian Zionist evangelicals (he received the support of less than a quarter of American Jews).
And, indeed, Mohammad Shtayyeh, a member of the Fatah central committee, has already pledged that the Palestinian leadership, in coordination with Jordan and other Arab states, will resist the dictate.
Yet it is not just Arabs or Muslims who support the Palestinians’ just demands for a fair peace agreement.
Innumerable people worldwide – of all faiths and backgrounds, as well as resolutions by the UN Security Council, the UN General Assembly, and the International Court of Justice – also support this stance.
This is true even in the US: according to a poll released by the Arab American Institute, only 20% of Americans (including American Arabs and American Jews) favor moving the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.
The Palestinians are calling for a two-state solution, with East Jerusalem as the capital of a Palestinian state and West Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.
The Israelis, by contrast, have consistently thwarted a two-state solution, and demanded to have Jerusalem all to themselves.
In short, it is the Israeli government’s position – and that of the Trump administration – that must change, if the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is ever to be resolved.
Many in Israel recognize this: 25 prominent Israelis, including former diplomats, army generals, and academics, signed a letter to Trump’s Mideast peace envoy denouncing the Jerusalem decision.
“The status of Jerusalem,” they wrote, “lies at the core of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and must be determined within the context of resolving that conflict.”
Any viable peace deal must be able to stand the test of time.
And that means it must be fair and just, rather than leaving one party seething with resentment – especially if that resentment extends to millions of people worldwide.
Attempting to ram a solution down Palestinians’ throats will increase the likelihood of even more violence, not peace.
A Dangerous Game of Chicken
SEOUL – So far, the war between US President Donald Trump and North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un over the latter’s nuclear program has been fought only in words.
But each turn of the rhetorical screw deepens the risk that, to paraphrase Winston Churchill, “jaw-jaw” could turn into “war-war.”
Last month, following North Korea’s second intercontinental ballistic missile test of the summer, the United Nations Security Council unanimously agreed to impose new and even stricter sanctions on the tiny country.
The response, reported in North Korean state-run media, was a pledge that “strategic steps accompanied by physical action will be taken mercilessly with the mobilization of all [North Korea’s] national strength.”
The next day, Trump went off script, asserting that further threats from North Korea would be met with “fire and fury like the world has never seen before.”
North Korea immediately did just that, threatening to carry out an “enveloping” strike on the US territory of Guam.
Trump shot back that the US military is “locked and loaded.”
And, indeed, as this exchange of rhetorical fire has unfolded, the US has reportedly been preparing revised military options for striking North Korea.
More ominous, according to a confidential US intelligence report, North Korea has achieved the capability to miniaturize nuclear warheads, and may have as many as 60 bombs.
The stakes are rising in Kim and Trump’s game of chicken.
It is unlikely that either North Korea or the US actually wants war.
But, as the late English historian A.J.P. Taylor concluded, after studying eight great wars since the late eighteenth century, wars have often “sprung more from apprehension than from a lust for war or for conquest.”
According to Taylor, many European wars “were started by a threatened power, which had nothing to gain by war and much to lose.”
If Taylor were alive to witness the current situation – characterized by fear-enhancing misperception, miscalculation, and overreaction – he would undoubtedly be feeling an alarming sense of déjà vu.
The question now is: what can be done to avoid catastrophe?
For starters, both the US and North Korea will have to avoid cornering one another.
During the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, US President John F. Kennedy was firm in his stance that Soviet missiles would not be permitted in Cuba.
But he knew better than to pursue a total American victory and a total Soviet defeat.
Instead, Kennedy offered a deal that would protect Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev’s reputation in the eyes of Kremlin hawks: the US would withdraw its missiles from Turkey (which were superfluous already), in exchange for the withdrawal of Soviet missiles from Cuba.
That pragmatic and courageous approach created the necessary space for the two leaders – neither of whom actually wanted a nuclear war – to retreat from the brink without losing face.
To bring today’s crisis to a peaceful conclusion, Kim will have to tone down his aggression.
But, for that to happen, the Trump administration needs to demonstrate clearly that its goal is not regime change, but policy change – that is, denuclearization – in North Korea.
Unfortunately, the signals coming out of the US are still mixed.
While Secretary of State Rex Tillerson’s recent remarks on the crisis focused on diplomacy, CIA Director Mike Pompeo has mentioned regime change, and National Security Advisor General H.R. McMaster has raised the possibility of a preventive war.
While it is important to put pressure on Kim to bring him to the negotiating table, such pressure must be more carefully calibrated.
If the US appears to be seeking regime change or a preemptive war, a panicked Kim will be more likely to lash out.
The goal should be relative, not absolute, security for both sides.
To this end, it is crucial to maintain rigorous civilian control of the military.
World War I broke out largely because of the militarization of the political decision-making process.
By not taking national military-mobilization processes off of autopilot, European political leaders allowed for an international chain reaction to occur.
Once the march to war had begun, there was not much room left for diplomacy.
Yet, far from making space for diplomacy, Trump adviser Sebastian Gorka recently told the press that, “The idea that Secretary Tillerson is going to discuss military matters is simply nonsensical.”
But why shouldn’t America’s top diplomat have significant influence over military matters?
If this does not change soon, we may, as then-British Prime Minister David Lloyd George wrote of World War I, “[muddle] into war” yet again.
South Korean political leaders must also avoid being swept up by this intensifying war rhetoric.
After North Korea’s 2010 sinking of the Cheonan warship and bombardment of Yeonpyeong Island, the South Korean military toughened its rules of engagement.
Now, South Korean military leaders are warning that if North Korea attacks again, it will face retaliation not just against the proximate source of those attacks, but against the North’s command leadership.
Much like Trump’s threats, this policy is intended to deter North Korea, but it is more likely to fuel a rapid escalation of conflict.
China also has a key role to play.
On June 10, 1994, at the peak of the first North Korean nuclear crisis, China informed Kim’s father, Kim Jong-il, that it would no longer veto UN sanctions on North Korea, driving the elder Kim to adopt a less antagonistic position.
China may be using a similar tactic today, as it declares publicly, via state media, that North Korea should not count on China’s support in a military conflict of its own making.
Neither Trump nor Kim seems to have sufficient political capital to spearhead a shift from military threats to diplomatic solutions.
Given the far-reaching risks posed by this rapidly escalating crisis, it may well be up to other stakeholders to take the lead.
Will China act as the regional stabilizer it so often proclaims itself to be?
President Xi Jinping is being tested in this crisis as much as Trump and Kim.
The End of Trump’s Market Honeymoon
NEW YORK – When Donald Trump was elected President of the United States, stock markets rallied impressively.
Investors were initially giddy about Trump’s promises of fiscal stimulus, deregulation of energy, health care, and financial services, and steep cuts in corporate, personal, estate, and capital-gains taxes.
But will the reality of Trumponomics sustain a continued rise in equity prices?
It is little wonder that corporations and investors have been happy.
This traditional Republican embrace of trickle-down supply-side economics will mostly favor corporations and wealthy individuals, while doing almost nothing to create jobs or raise blue-collar workers’ incomes.
According to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, almost half of the benefits from Trump’s proposed tax cuts would go to the top 1% of income earners.
Yet the corporate sector’s animal spirits may soon give way to primal fear: the market rally is already running out of steam, and Trump’s honeymoon with investors might be coming to an end.
There are several reasons for this.
For starters, the anticipation of fiscal stimulus may have pushed stock prices up, but it also led to higher long-term interest rates, which hurts capital spending and interest-sensitive sectors such as real estate.
Meanwhile, the strengthening dollar will destroy more of the jobs typically held by Trump’s blue-collar base.
The president may have “saved” 1,000 jobs in Indiana by bullying and cajoling the air-conditioner manufacturer Carrier; but the US dollar’s appreciation since the election could destroy almost 400,000 manufacturing jobs over time.
Moreover, Trump’s fiscal-stimulus package might end up being much larger than the market’s current pricing suggests.
As Presidents Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush showed, Republicans can rarely resist the temptation to cut corporate, income, and other taxes, even when they have no way to make up for the lost revenue and no desire to cut spending.
If this happens again under Trump, fiscal deficits will push up interest rates and the dollar even further, and hurt the economy in the long term.
A second reason for investors to curb their enthusiasm is the specter of inflation.
With the US economy already close to full employment, Trump’s fiscal stimulus will fuel inflation more than it does growth.
Inflation will then force even Janet Yellen’s dovish Federal Reserve to hike up interest rates sooner and faster than it otherwise would have done, which will drive up long-term interest rates and the value of the dollar still more.
Third, this undesirable policy mix of excessively loose fiscal policy and tight monetary policy will tighten financial conditions, hurting blue-collar workers’ incomes and employment prospects.
An already protectionist Trump administration will then have to pursue additional protectionist measures to maintain these workers’ support, thereby further hampering economic growth and diminishing corporate profits.
If Trump takes his protectionism too far, he will undoubtedly spark trade wars.
America’s trading partners will have little choice but to respond to US import restrictions by imposing their own tariffs on US exports.
The ensuing tit-for-tat will hinder global economic growth, and damage economies and markets everywhere.
It is worth remembering how America’s 1930 Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act triggered global trade wars that exacerbated the Great Depression.
Fourth, Trump’s actions suggest that his administration’s economic interventionism will go beyond traditional protectionism.
Trump has already shown his willingness to target firms’ foreign operations with the threat of import levies, public accusations of price gouging, and immigration restrictions (which make it harder to attract talent).
The Nobel laureate economist Edmund S. Phelps has described Trump’s direct interference in the corporate sector as reminiscent of corporatist Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy.
Indeed, if former President Barack Obama had treated the corporate sector in the way that Trump has, he would have been smeared as a communist; but for some reason when Trump does it, corporate America puts its tail between its legs.
Fifth, Trump is questioning US alliances, cozying up to American rivals such as Russia, and antagonizing important global powers such as China.
His erratic foreign policies are spooking world leaders, multinational corporations, and global markets generally.
Finally, Trump may pursue damage-control methods that only make matters worse.
For example, he and his advisers have already made verbal pronouncements intended to weaken the dollar.
But talk is cheap, and open-mouth operations have only a temporary effect on the currency.
This means that Trump might take a more radical and heterodox approach.
During the campaign, he bashed the Fed for being too dovish, and creating a “false economy.”
And yet he may now be tempted to appoint new members to the Fed Board who are even more dovish, and less independent, than Yellen, in order to boost credit to the private sector.
If that fails, Trump could unilaterally intervene to weaken the dollar, or impose capital controls to limit dollar-strengthening capital inflows.
Markets are already becoming wary; full-blown panic is likely if protectionism and reckless, politicized monetary policy precipitate trade, currency, and capital-control wars.
To be sure, expectations of stimulus, lower taxes, and deregulation could still boost the economy and the market’s performance in the short term.
But, as the vacillation in financial markets since Trump’s inauguration indicates, the president’s inconsistent, erratic, and destructive policies will take their toll on domestic and global economic growth in the long run.
Can Trump Prove His Sanity?
LONDON – Since Donald Trump took over the United States presidency a year ago, doubts over his mental stability and his very sanity have been mounting.
With the release of Michael Wolff’s book Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House, which claims to offer a behind-the-scenes look at the president’s dysfunctional administration, those doubts seem to have taken on a new salience and urgency.
But, beyond claiming on Twitter that he is a “very stable genius,” what could Trump actually do to prove that he is psychologically fit for what, by some definitions, is the world’s highest office?
There is no clear physical test for mental illness.
Even if Trump were subjected to a battery of blood tests and brain scans, the results would most likely prove nothing.
The vast majority of people with psychosis would have normal results.
Likewise, an abnormal test wouldn’t necessarily imply impaired mental capacity: a person can retain their intelligence, even after losing a significant amount of their brain.
For example, a recent study showed that all but four of 54 children who underwent a hemispherectomy, in which half the brain is removed to treat severe and intractable epilepsy, showed the same or even improved intellectual capacity.
So Trump could literally have half a brain, and it still wouldn’t prove that he was mentally ill.
Another approach to determining Trump’s mental fitness would be to have psychiatrists examine him and share their findings.
But, however unbiased the psychiatrists were, such assessments would ultimately be subjective.
As any trial judge or criminal lawyer can attest, for every psychological expert produced by the defense in a legal case, prosecutors can produce one to argue the opposite.
Consider the case of Anders Breivik, who killed 77 people in Norway in 2011.
At his trial, two teams of court-appointed psychiatrists disagreed with each other over whether he was insane.
If psychiatrists can’t agree on whether a mass murderer is insane, what hope is there that they could agree about Trump?
In any case, Trump seems to have no interest in bringing in experts.
Instead, he has pursued his own – and, from a psychiatric perspective, ill-advised – strategy for rebutting questions about his sanity.
One of Trump’s go-to defenses has been that he is highly intelligent – or, as he put it recently on Twitter, “like, really smart.”
But, even if true, this, too, proves nothing.
Many highly intelligent people suffer from mental illness.
In fact, studies have shown that the populations of countries with higher average IQs suffer higher rates of suicide.
And suicide rates at the prestigious universities of Oxford and Cambridge are in line with average suicide rates for university-age people, highlighting again that being smart – or even smart and privileged – does not immunize a person against mental illness.
Trump also claims that he is too successful to be mentally ill.
But Howard Hughes’s success as a film producer and airline owner made him one of the richest Americans to emerge during the first half of the twentieth century.
He also set several world airspeed records.
Yet he suffered from severe obsessive-compulsive disorder, and he died suffering from extreme malnutrition and possible drug addiction.
Likewise, John Paul Getty, the US-born industrialist who was the world’s richest person during his time, was so obsessively frugal and paranoid that, when his grandson was kidnapped, he negotiated down the ransom demand, even after the kidnappers sent him a lock of his grandson’s hair and one of his ears.
Trump’s third key defense is to turn allegations about his sanity against his accusers and political opponents.
That tactic is not new.
In the Soviet Union – and, many argue, in China today – political dissidents would be committed to psychiatric care, precisely to discredit them.
Russia actually withdrew from the World Psychiatric Association for most of the 1980s, in order to avoid being expelled for such practices.
As an experiment led by David Rosenhan of Stanford University in the 1970s demonstrated, a label of mental illness can be difficult to remove.
Healthy volunteers invented a hallucination, in order to find out whether the psychiatric system could distinguish genuine mental illness.
The volunteers ended up being admitted to psychiatric institutions, where they behaved normally and claimed no symptoms.
But, with the psychotic label already affixed to their files, whatever they did was assumed to be a symptom of their insanity.
At best, they would be declared to be “in remission.”
Rosenhan’s experiment suggests that questions about Trump’s mental health might never go away, no matter what steps he takes to change his detractors’ minds.
Even if he stops ranting on Twitter or speaking in convoluted and incoherent sentences, at best he will be viewed as being “in remission.”
Modern psychiatrists would argue that they have taken to heart the lessons of the Rosenhan experiment, and now make diagnoses much more cautiously and rigorously.
Yet irresponsible political uses of psychiatric medicine still abound.
To name one example, the British government recently attempted to recruit National Health Service mental-health professionals to report those suspected of being psychiatrically vulnerable to extremist ideology.
In the original Rosenhan experiment, the only people who reliably recognized that the “impostor patients” were, in fact, mentally healthy were their fellow psychiatric inmates.
By this logic, perhaps we are asking the wrong people to assess Trump’s sanity.
In any case, if Trump’s detractors hope to drive him from office, they will need more than armchair psychiatry.
Trump’s Fateful Mistake on Consumer Financial Protection
WASHINGTON, DC – The founding myth of US President Donald Trump’s administration is that it will look out for ordinary Americans, and that cutting taxes on companies, deregulating finance, and rolling back environmental protections will achieve that.
None of this makes any sense, and the administration’s claims that these measures will spur an economic boom – with annual growth accelerating from 2% to 3% – are pure fantasy.
American voters are beginning to figure this out – as indicated by recent election results in Virginia and elsewhere.
But it will take a while for the falsity of Trump’s promises to be exposed, partly because many macroeconomic changes are complex and become apparent (or don’t) over time.
Now, however, Trump has made a major tactical mistake.
By seizing control of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), and placing an ideological extremist in charge, he has brought to the fore the deepest flaws in his administration’s founding myth.
The CFPB was established by the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial-reform legislation to do exactly what its name implies: protect consumers in their various financial transactions.
A new agency was needed because existing regulators, including the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, had manifestly and repeatedly failed to protect consumers from abuses, such as deceptive and fraudulent mortgage-lending practices, some of which were at the heart of what went wrong in 2007-08.
As Elizabeth Warren (then a consumer advocate, now a US senator from Massachusetts) powerfully pointed out, there was a lot more protection for people buying toasters than for someone taking out a 25-year mortgage.
Finance is complex, and a lot of devils could be, and were, hidden in the details.
The CFPB was designed, above all, to bring greater transparency to consumers’ financial transactions – actually a very pro-market contribution.
And the CFPB has done exactly what Congress designed it to do.
So far, the Bureau has arranged for the return of almost $12 billion to 29 million consumers.
At the same time, banks are reporting record profits – on the order of $171 billion, according to the latest data.
The CFPB is good for business, or at least for the straightforward, transparent business of traditional lending.
Unfortunately, some in the financial sector – such as payday lenders (which charge very high interest rates) – have never liked the scrutiny that the CFPB brings.
These players, among others, have worked hard to abolish or severely curtail the agency, donating a great deal of money to members of the House Financial Services Committee for the same end.
Anyone who appears before the committee on anything CFPB-related can expect to hear scorn and venom from its Republican members, who claim – on the basis of no real evidence whatsoever – that the agency impedes growth, destroys jobs, holds down wages, or something else.
Trump’s predecessor, Barack Obama, appointed – and the Senate confirmed – Richard Cordray as the CFPB’s first director.
By all reasonable accounts, Cordray did a terrific job. With his term about to expire in 2018, all Trump needed to do was wait him out.
Last week, however, Cordray unexpectedly resigned, naming his chief of staff as his successor.
Trump responded by appointing Mick Mulvaney, the head of the Office of Management and Budget, to run the CFPB.
A federal court has now ruled that Mulvaney may hold the position until the Senate can confirm a new director.
Trump’s first mistake was to call attention and bring drama to an appointment that was going to be his to make in any case. His second mistake was to appoint Mulvaney, an anti-government radical who wants to cut as many federal agencies as he can (and is now presiding more broadly over a tax plan that will greatly boost the budget deficit and national debt).
Naturally, Mulvaney has already announced an immediate freeze on all CFPB rules.
Over time, whatever the short-term outcome of any judicial appeals, we should expect key people to be forced out of the agency, procedures to break down, and consumers to receive less redress.
The effect of institutional turmoil will be dramatically chilling.
The CFPB is currently one of the most responsive government bureaucracies, focused on a specific set of achievable tasks.
This will now end, likely quite soon.
But protecting consumers from financial abuses is not like macroeconomic policymaking or even budget making, which very few people understand.
Consumers know if they have been ripped off. And they know if someone helps them get their money back.
In a year or two, the newspapers will be full of stories of people – some of them Trump supporters – being exploited by unscrupulous financial operators and then ignored (or worse) by the federal government.
The backlash against Mulvaney-style minimal government – which means no protection whatsoever for ordinary people – begins at the CFPB.
A founding myth that so visibly harms those whom it claims to defend will return to the political fringe, where it has belonged all along.
A Trump New Year
WASHINGTON, DC – As US President Donald Trump decamped to his mansion-cum-private club in Palm Beach, Florida, for the holidays, he left Washington, DC, on edge.
It’s obvious that Trump and his strong allies in Congress – he has more than one might expect – are determined to torpedo what’s supposed to be an independent legal inquiry into whether Trump and his campaign colluded with Russia in its efforts to defeat Hillary Clinton in 2016.
The Trump camp’s behavior toward Special Counsel Robert Mueller and the FBI, which is aiding Mueller’s investigation, makes Richard Nixon and his aides’ behavior toward the Watergate investigators look tame and respectful by comparison.
Although Nixon did fire the first independent prosecutor, Archibald Cox, in the infamous “Saturday Night Massacre,” another was installed and Nixon ultimately resigned rather than face impeachment by the House of Representatives and conviction by the Senate.
(In that case, he would have had to leave office without a valuable pension.)
Oddly, Trump and his advisers seem not to have learned from more recent history, either.
In firing FBI director James Comey, Trump opened himself up to the appointment of a special counsel.
Whether an impeachment effort will be made cannot be known now.
But most observers believe that key Republicans in the House of Representatives, where impeachment would begin, have thrown in their lot with Trump, mainly because they fear his loyal base (about a third of the country, clustered in many congressional districts).
That could change if the Democrats take over the House in next November’s midterm elections.
But even if the Democrats won both houses of Congress, they would most likely be unable to muster the two-thirds majority needed to convict Trump in the Senate.
Trump clearly fears that Mueller will find grounds to indict him.
One strong possibility is that the president would be charged with obstructing justice – both an impeachable offense and a crime.
A criminal charge of obstruction requires proof of intent to convict, but Trump’s serial efforts to impinge on or halt the investigation suggest that he worries that he would be vulnerable.
Whether a president can actually be indicted is an unsettled question; but if Mueller believes that the president shouldn’t be indicted, he would submit his charges to the House, which would then decide whether to proceed with impeachment.
Trump is determined to head off both outcomes, and he’s clearly worried that he might fail.
But it’s not just Trump who could be in legal trouble.
Mueller has run a disciplined and tight-lipped shop, free of leaks; but it’s widely expected that Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, will be indicted.
That may explain why Trump is treading where Nixon never dared to go, by trying to smear both Mueller and the FBI.
Until now, both had enjoyed bipartisan respect.
But Trump has been frustrated by the warnings he has received that firing Mueller would set off a political firestorm.
(Because Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein must make the call to dismiss Mueller, and has said that he sees no reason to do so, Trump would first have to fire Rosenstein, which would look too much like the Saturday Night Massacre, the turning point in Nixon’s presidency.)
So, by raising questions about Mueller’s integrity and that of the FBI, Trump and his allies are trying to set the stage for a widespread public dismissal of whatever Mueller reports.
It’s been a dismaying spectacle.
Trump denounces the FBI in his tweets and other statements.
His right-wing allies in the House of Representatives (even more partisan than the Senate) have subjected the new FBI director, Christopher Wray, to hostile questioning in various committee hearings.
And they have grilled the deputy director, Andrew McCabe – who was close to Comey and could verify his claims that Trump tried to persuade him to limit the investigation – for eight and nine hours at a time.
The bullying of senior Justice Department and FBI officials by House committees has been without precedent since the anti-communist witch hunts of the 1950s.
This strategy seeks to force the dismissal or reassignment of troublesome FBI and Justice officials.
Sadly, it is having some success.
McCabe will reportedly retire in 2018, and a recent poll showed a significant drop in public support for Mueller’s investigation over the past six months.
This is what has the capital on edge.
No one can be sure that Trump won’t take some dramatic action – whether related to international affairs or to the Russia investigation – during his sojourn in Palm Beach.
While Trump continues to succumb to Vladimir Putin’s blandishments (retired US intelligence official James Clapper recently remarked that Putin, a former KGB agent, is a great case officer in his handling of Trump), US relations with Russia are deteriorating.
Both sides are taking steps that are deepening bilateral tensions.
Russian submarines have been trolling near vital Western communications cables on the Atlantic Ocean floor, implying a risk of serious damage to the US and European economies and way of life.
In response, NATO plans to establish a new command center to monitor such activities.
Russian military planes have also been flying close to NATO aircraft.
Moreover, the Trump administration recently announced that it would permit the sale of lethal defensive weapons to Ukraine, to counter Russian aggression there – a move that Russia says will only beget more violence.
Then there’s North Korea, with which a war is quite possible, according to some retired military officials.
Trump is known to be volatile and impulsive, but so far his major advisers have restrained him.
They work hard at this, trying to avoid taking actions or telling him things that might upset him.
The Washington Post recently disclosed that his intelligence briefers avoid talking about Russia.
But the constellation of foreign-policy and intelligence officials around Trump is understood to be about to change.
It is widely expected that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson will be replaced by a more hawkish figure early in 2018.
An exodus of White House staff members has begun, owing to dissatisfaction on their or Trump’s part.
Even if we get through the holidays in relative peace, it’s clear that 2018 will be a tumultuous year.
Trump’s Missing North Korea Strategy
DENVER – US President Donald Trump certainly has a point when he complains that he inherited the difficult problem in North Korea.
North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has shown no interest in negotiation, or even in listening to what anyone has to say about his reckless pursuit of nuclear weapons and the long-range missiles needed to deliver them.
But the fact that Trump inherited the problem does not absolve him of responsibility for addressing it.
So far, he has failed even to articulate, much less implement, a strategy for dealing with North Korea.
Almost one year into his presidency, his only achievement has been to secure additional sanctions at the United Nations.
Worse still, his bitter complaints about his predecessors suggest that he has no idea what to do next.
Trump’s latest attempt to deal with the problem came earlier this month, when he noisily announced that his administration was putting North Korea back on the US Department of State’s list of state sponsors of terrorism.
His decision, though justified in light of Kim’s behavior, was largely symbolic, as was former President George W. Bush’s October 2008 decision to remove North Korea from that list in the first place.
The Trump White House claims that re-designating North Korea as a state sponsor of terrorism is a “critical step.”
It is not.
In fact, the US Department of the Treasury does not even require such a designation to formulate additional sanctions.
State sponsors of terrorism are ineligible for US military support – which was hardly a possibility for North Korea.
And the United States is legally prohibited from supporting any loans or other forms of assistance offered to state sponsors of terrorism by international financial institutions of which the US is a member.
North Korea, however, is not a member of any international financial institution.
As many have pointed out, the terrorism list is by no means a complete compendium of countries whose security services may have been involved with terrorist groups.
Currently, the full list includes just four countries: Iran, North Korea, Sudan, and Syria.
Despite the late Venezuelan dictator Hugo Chávez’s well-known ties to the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) – which the US State Department designates as a terrorist organization – Venezuela managed to stay off the list.
Similarly, many believe that Pakistan’s security services maintain ties with groups that would clearly qualify the country for inclusion on the list.
Still, even as a symbolic gesture, the context of Bush’s decision to remove North Korea from the list was entirely different from that of Trump’s decision to restore it.
In 2008, North Korea had satisfied certain conditions.
First, it agreed to participate in the six-party talks with China, Japan, Russia, South Korea, and the US (which I represented as Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs).
The talks’ explicit goal was to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula, and they resulted in North Korea closing its nuclear facility in Yongbyon.
Moreover, at the time of its delisting, North Korea was also participating in talks to establish a verification system for its nuclear activities.
The regime invited international inspectors to Yongbyon, and provided substantial records of the Yongbyon reactor’s operations, which are still one of the most accurate resources for measuring the amount of plutonium actually produced there.
At the time, North Korea had agreed to blow up the Yongbyon reactor’s cooling tower, to reciprocate the US’s symbolic act with one of its own.
It was a partial deal, to be sure.
But Trump would have taken it in a New York minute.
Subsequently, the agreement did begin to unravel, owing to North Korea’s steadfast refusal to acknowledge that it ever had a program, past or present, to develop fissile material through highly enriched uranium (HEU).
The regime failed to explain international purchases of equipment consistent with such a program; and samples of specialized materials that it provided to US diplomats raised suspicions further.
After a several-year hiatus, the Yongbyon nuclear reactor is operational once again.
Notably, all six of the underground nuclear tests that North Korea has conducted since 2006 have been consistent with plutonium harvested from the reactor before the six-party talks.
The possibility that North Korea is operating an HEU facility somewhere in its tunneled landscape is undoubtedly a cause for great concern.
But Yongbyon, contrary to those who have argued that it was on its last legs, has always constituted a clear and present danger.
The fact that Trump can put North Korea back on the terrorism list with little bureaucratic fuss and virtually no international repercussions demonstrates why the list is a useful sanction for the US to have at its disposal.
The standard for de-designation – no acts of terrorism or cooperation with terrorist groups in the past six months – is flexible enough that removal from the list can readily be used as a diplomatic bargaining chip.
Likewise, de-designation can easily be reversed when conditions merit it – such as when Kim orchestrates the assassination of his half-brother in a Malaysian airport.
Solving the North Korea problem will require a seriousness of purpose and a level of discipline that Trump has not yet exhibited.
An effective policy would include cooperation with China, not gushing flattery for China’s leaders.
That cooperation would have to be based on a long-term commitment, not one-off transactions.
And, perhaps more importantly, it would require daily engagement not just with China, but with all of the other regional stakeholders as well.
Needless to say, such a policy would benefit from a US secretary of state who is committed to maintaining a team of experienced diplomatic professionals, and from recognition by Trump and his advisers that building on the efforts of one’s predecessors is more effective than accusing them of making the job harder.
Unfortunately, that last lesson continues to elude this administration.
Donald Trump’s Historic Mistake
PARIS – US President Donald Trump has announced that the United States will no longer participate in the 2015 Paris climate agreement, the landmark United Nations treaty that many of us worked so hard to achieve.
Trump is making a mistake that will have grave repercussions for his own country, and for the world.
Trump claims that he will try to renegotiate the deal reached in Paris, or craft a new one.
But leaders from around the world have already hailed the agreement as a breakthrough for the fight against climate change, a victory for international cooperation, and a boon to the global economy.
That remains true today.
Among the many challenges we face today, climate change is unique in its global scale.
It affects every element of life on this planet – from ecosystems and food production to cities and industrial supply chains.
Viewing climate change as strictly an “environmental” problem misses the point entirely.
We might charitably assume that Trump simply does not understand the implications of his decision.
And yet, regardless of what Trump thinks, we know that he is surrounded by advisers who know very well what is at stake.
On the campaign trail, Trump promised to create jobs and protect American workers from the ravages of the world.
And he signed off his tweet announcing that he had made a decision on the Paris accord with the words, “MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!”
But Trump’s decision undermines every one of these goals, and it goes against the wishes of a vast majority of Americans, including many of his own supporters.
By turning his back on the Paris agreement, he is increasing Americans’ exposure to the devastating effects of climate change – many of which they are already experiencing.
Moreover, he is undercutting jobs in the thriving renewable-energy and electric-vehicle sectors, which are increasingly employing the very workers he purports to represent.
More broadly, Trump has diminished America itself, and abdicated its global leadership role.
When I was a member of the French government participating in a global tour to build consensus for climate action – an effort that eventually culminated in the Paris agreement – I experienced firsthand what American leadership can achieve.
It is tragic to watch that force for good be subverted by denial and myopia.
By burying their heads in the sand, Trump and his advisers must be hoping that reality will simply go away.
They have somehow concluded that America will be spared from the droughts already destroying farms in California’s Central Valley, the rising sea levels already flooding coastal cities, the storms and wildfires routinely ravaging vast swathes of the American countryside, and the water- and food-supply disruptions that threaten us all.
Other parties to the Paris agreement have responded to Trump’s decision with strength, thus proving the resilience of the agreement itself.
The rest of the world will be sad to see an America that has been left behind, owing to Trump’s decision.
But we will not wait; in fact, we are already moving on.
The world’s response will be clear at the G20 meeting in Germany this July.
Already, Europe, China, India, Canada, and Pacific Rim and South American countries have recommitted to the goals of the Paris agreement.
These countries understand the dangers of climate change, as do ExxonMobil’s global shareholders, who, just this week, rejected that company’s attempts to ignore the impact of climate change on its business.
By placing America in the company of the only two countries that have not joined the Paris agreement – Syria and Nicaragua – Trump’s decision is completely at odds with the current global atmosphere of cooperation.
The world’s major economies are reaching new agreements every day to collaborate on research and development, infrastructure investment, and industrial strategy.
They are working together to achieve a low-carbon economy, and to make 2020 the year that global greenhouse-gas emissions will have peaked.
European leaders are already meeting with their Indian and Chinese counterparts to find areas where they can cooperate on developing clean energy and green infrastructure.
Massive investments will be made in these areas, and the European Central Bank, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, and many other institutions are devising mechanisms to finance them.
Likewise, sovereign wealth funds with immense clout in the global financial system are redirecting their investments toward the green economy.
Even the most optimistic among us did not predict that the old fossil-fuel paradigm would change so quickly.
But Europe is phasing out coal-fueled energy production.
And India, China, and South Korea are rapidly shifting their investments away from coal, and toward renewable-energy sources.
Worldwide, the competition is about “who can go green the fastest.”
New industries are springing up, at scale, in areas ranging from electrification and smart-grid design to electric vehicles, green construction and recycling technologies, and organic chemicals.
The renewable-energy revolution, now spreading at an unprecedented rate, is already transforming entire sectors, not least transportation.
In all of these sectors around the world, the excitement and growth potential is palpable.
It is a shame that Trump has decided to shirk America’s global responsibility and turn his back on these developments.
His decision is a blow to so many people – including a great many Americans – who have worked hard to be a successful part of the new economy.
Still, Trump cannot take all of America with him.
State- and city-level climate action is sweeping across the US, increasing in scale and ambition.
Trump’s historic mistake represents an obstacle to that collective action; but it can hardly stop it.
Just as Chinese companies are now training US coal workers to build wind farms, the rest of the world will continue to work together, and build the markets and workforce of the future.
Profiles in Discouragement
NEW YORK – Some specialists in the life sciences say that no one is ever fully cured of any injury or disease, because our cells forever retain traces, memories, of even the slightest attacks on the body’s integrity.
So it will be with the United States.
One day, the US will turn the page on Donald Trump.
But America will never recover completely from the unstanchable wound that his presidency’s baseness, bull-headed stupidity, and puzzling passivity in the face of China’s global ambitions has inflicted on its culture and international standing.
Is Trump a symptom? Or is he a terminal disease?
Demoralization and defeatism have not spared the Democrats, as I found recently in New York and on a recent visit to Chicago to address a seminar at the University of Chicago’s Institute of Politics.
At the home of the Iranian-American Nazee Moinian, whose Manhattan apartment recalls the patrician abodes of the members of the Algonquin Round Table, the assembled elites are in agreement.
Trump, by not backing the Kurds in their bid for independence from Iraq, committed not just a moral error, but also an irreparable political mistake.
He betrayed his Kurdish ally.
He strengthened his Iranian adversary.
The German legal and political theorist Carl Schmitt might say that Trump had confused his friend and his enemy, dealing with the former as he should have dealt with the latter.
Inexplicably, Trump sacrificed (once again) a crucial US national interest, this time by abandoning the sole force in the Middle East region (outside of Israel) on which America could safely and seriously rely.
How does one respond to such a forfeiture?
With what resources?
Was there really no way to counter the club of bad neighbors who refuse to countenance any discussion of Kurdish sovereignty?
Some Democrats swallow their national pride and say that France’s young president, Emmanuel Macron, newly crowned by Time magazine as king of Europe, is in a better position to step in and stay the hand of Iraq and Iran.
Older Democrats express not the slightest reservation about the use of US power during the Cold War.
But here they are, paralyzed, disarmed, when the time comes to raise their voice – merely their voice! – against the sinister but motley gang of four (Iran, Iraq, Turkey, and Syria) blocking Kurdish independence.
At Temple Emanu-El on Fifth Avenue, the most beautiful synagogue in New York and one of the largest in the world, I was recently interviewed by Pamela Paul, editor of the New York Times Book Review.
The conversation again turned to Macron.
I tried to explain that his trademark phrase, en même temps (at the same time), which tends to be heard here as an expression of American-style pragmatism, may instead be one of the most visible traces of his doctrinal proximity to the French Protestant philosopher Paul Ricœur.
Far from reflecting careful deliberation over an ambiguous choice, “at the same time” is the credo of someone suspended in fear and trembling before the unsolvable and terrifying mystery of the double nature – physical and spiritual, mortal and resurrected – of the tormented body of Christ.
But very soon we arrive at the question of anti-Semitism in America.
On the one hand, it is to be found in that horde of nativists, white supremacists, and neo-confederates who descended on Charlottesville, Virginia, in August to break some black and Jewish heads.
On the other hand, it is seen among leftists on US campuses who have caught the fever of BDS (Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions), the global campaign against Israeli products that is becoming increasingly difficult to differentiate from a quasi-overt campaign against products and businesses that are just plain Jewish.
In this sense, are we living in the époque of Trump, in which Trump’s revival of the “America First” slogan of the American Nazis in the 1930s has encouraged a loosening of bigoted tongues?
Could it be that Trump himself, despite his officially pro-Israel positions, is a closeted anti-Semite?
The truth is that the question of Trump – the enigma of the man and even his very name – takes up much too much space in public debate.
The truth is that in spending time wondering whether Trump is insane, or, like an overstuffed and obscene Hamlet, he feigns madness to confuse his adversaries, we are all falling into the trap of a narcissism that, here in the US, is the new face of nihilism.
What’s a President to Do?
SEOUL – Donald Trump took office promising a raft of sweeping economic-policy changes for the United States.
He has quickly discovered, like previous US presidents, that America’s political system is designed to prevent rapid, large-scale change, by interposing formidable institutional obstacles, from the Congress and career civil servants to state governments and the courts.
Start with reform of personal income tax.
This should be a slam-dunk, because the president and congressional Republican leaders are on the same page.
Trump’s goal of removing the government’s groping hand from Americans’ pockets, by cutting the top marginal tax rate on ordinary income from 39.5% to 33%, is entirely consistent with mainstream Republican ideology, according to which high tax rates penalize success and stifle innovation.
But, to be politically viable, significant tax cuts for the wealthy would have to be accompanied by at least token tax cuts for the middle class.
And broad-based tax cuts would blow a hole in the budget and excite congressional deficit hawks, of whom there are still a few.
One can imagine closing loopholes to render rate cuts revenue neutral.
But one person’s loophole is another’s entitlement.
Even if there are economic arguments for eliminating, say, the deductibility of mortgage interest payments, imagine the howls of protest from homeowners, including many Trump voters, who borrowed to purchase their houses.
Imagine the reaction of Trump’s friends in real estate.
Cuts on the spending side would assuage the deficit hawks.
And big cuts to the Environmental Protection Agency, the US Agency for International Development, and National Public Radio are high on the Republican hit list.
But the vast majority of federal spending is on entitlements, the military, and other proverbial “third rail” items that elected officials touch at their peril. Simply put, broad-based spending cuts to match broad-based income-tax reductions are not politically feasible.
Eliminating federal subsidies for health-insurance coverage under the Affordable Care Act (“Obamacare”) would save the government a little over $100 billion a year, about 3% of federal spending.
But those subsidies are largely paid for by their own dedicated taxes.
Moreover, Trump and congressional Republicans are learning that replacing Obamacare is easier said than done.
Health-care reform, as Hillary Clinton could have told them, is fearsomely complex.
It is increasingly clear that the name will change (“Trumpcare,” anyone?), and it can be expected that the Republican plan will cover fewer people; but much of the substance will remain the same.
Because corporate taxes are less significant in terms of overall federal revenue, rate cutting doesn’t pose a comparable threat to the budget balance.
But here there is no agreement between Congress and the Trump administration on the form such cuts should take.
House Speaker Paul Ryan and others favor moving to a border adjustment tax that would tax corporate cash flows regardless of where the goods sold by US companies are produced, while exempting exports.
Others, such as Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, are evidently skeptical.
And an important part of Trump’s business constituency – import-dependent retailers like Target and Walmart – are actively hostile.
Agreement on a plan won’t come easily.
Trump’s other flagship proposal is a $1 trillion infrastructure program.
But this initiative will run headlong into deficit concerns, and it is fundamentally at odds with Republican skepticism about big government, and specifically about the public sector’s capacity to carry out investment plans efficiently.
Trump will want to be able to point to a few signature projects.
He will want his border wall with Mexico.
But any new federal infrastructure spending is likely to be more symbolic than real.
So what will an impatient president, frustrated and hemmed in on all sides, do?
First, Trump will focus on the one set of economic policies a president can pursue without close congressional cooperation, namely those affecting trade.
He can invoke the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, restricting imports on the grounds that they threaten US “material interests.”
He can invoke the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 on the grounds that the loss of jobs to Mexico and China constitutes an economic emergency.
He can even invoke the Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917 on the grounds that the US has Special Forces active in the Middle East.
Second, Trump will respond, as populists do, by attempting to distract attention from his failure to deliver the economic goods.
This means directing his ire and that of his supporters toward others – whether internal enemies like the press, the intelligence community, and Barack Obama, or external adversaries like the Islamic State and China.
It wouldn’t be the first time a politician used a domestic political crusade or a foreign policy adventure to divert attention from his economic failures.
We have already seen Trump’s tendency to lash out at perceived enemies, foreign and domestic.
And we know that this confrontational style is the modus operandi of senior White House advisers like Stephen Bannon and Stephen Miller.
We can hope that cooler heads prevail.
But, given the constraints on implementing Trump’s economic agenda, it’s hard to be optimistic.
Donald Trump Thought
LONDON – After US President Donald Trump’s recent visit to China, it can only be a matter of time before right-wing media outlets like Breitbart News and Fox News suggest that he should take a page from President Xi Jinping’s playbook, despite the overwhelmingly Leninist nature of its contents.
At last month’s 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, Xi was effectively anointed his country’s supreme leader.
By enshrining so-called Xi Jinping Thought in the CPC charter, Party members established Xi alongside the People’s Republic’s two historical giants, Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping – the only other Chinese leaders with officially recognized eponymous ideologies.
The content of Xi’s intellectual contribution to Marxist-Leninism further entrenches his position.
Light on Marxism and heavy on Leninism, Xi Jinping Thought merges central control with nationalism.
And it firmly establishes Xi as his country’s most powerful leader since Mao, enabling him, to paraphrase Trump, to “make China great again.”
Trump can only envy Xi.
After all, changing the CPC charter is straightforward: Anyone who dares to disagree openly with a proposed amendment can look forward to a visit from the Party’s anti-corruption police.
Changing the US Constitution is not so simple.
But just consider the possibility: Amend the US constitution, as has happened 27 times, to include “Donald Trump Thought,” and fire up the masses, yet again, with the hope of “America First.”
Donald Trump Thought is easy to understand and requires little intellectual strain to master.
First, be nice to countries where there is, or could be, a Trump Tower or other family franchise.
Be particularly friendly to countries that roll out a long red carpet – or, better yet, a golden welcome mat – when Trump stops by.
Don’t worry if the country in question is a democracy or a dictatorship.
Actually, a country may be a better friend – to Trump, if not the US – if it is run by a “tough guy” who locks up (or worse) critics and opponents.
Democracies require leaders to answer too many questions, jump through too many hoops, and face too much resistance.
The second tenet of Donald Trump Thought provides a way to circumvent these inconveniences at home: Any news the leader doesn’t like is fake news.
Reality is whatever makes the leader look good.
This tenet dictates the following imperative: Keep every idea so simple that it can be expressed in less than 280 characters, tweeted from the sofa, Fox News blaring.
These ideas should appeal to the electorate’s most atavistic urges.
Their defining message should be “blood and soil.”
Hostility toward previous US presidents is a must as well.
By definition, anything Barack Obama said or did was wrong.
Trump need not acknowledge that his predecessor saved the US economy from the depths of depression; he can simply take credit for the results, including rising job creation and asset prices.
Donald Trump Thought takes aim at two of Obama’s signature achievements: the 2010 Affordable Care Act (“Obamacare”) and the 2015 Iran nuclear deal.
But repealing Obamacare has proved much harder than Trump expected.
It would be a lot easier if only Trump could find something to replace it that would not leave poor and sick people – including his own constituents – much worse off.
As for the nuclear deal, Trump has moved beyond demonizing Iran publicly to decertifying the agreement, even though Iran has kept up its end of the bargain.
According to Donald Trump Thought, it doesn’t matter if that decision intensifies the Sunni-Shia clash in the Middle East.
Nor should a Trumpian thinker care if America’s closest democratic allies – in this case, the Europeans – disagree; on the contrary, European support for the agreement with Iran is yet another reason to scrap it.
Trump’s creed includes three more key principles.
First, trade surpluses with other countries are important – so important that it does not matter if the increased US exports mentioned in press releases after foreign visits are real or virtual.
The key is to be able to announce and even sign deals that sound big – the more billions in the boasts, the better.
(Questions about how to execute this requirement should be directed to China, where phantom deals for gullible foreigners are a diplomatic specialty.)
Second, evidence and facts are no basis for policy.
A Trumpian thinker diligently ignores all the mumbo jumbo about climate change.
Let the winds blow, the storms rage, the rain pour, the sea levels rise, and the air pollution kill, while denying that it could possibly have any relationship to humans greenhouse-gas emissions.
If scientists offer evidence to the contrary, call it a hoax, concocted to weaken America.
Above all, accept no limitations on coal production and hold the oil industry’s interests close to your heart at all times.
Finally, believe whom you want to believe – even if that means trusting Russian President Vladimir Putin, the ex-KGB man, over America’s own security and intelligence agencies.
The closer Special Counsel Robert Mueller and his team of investigators get to the truth about Russia’s interference in the 2016 election, the more you must insist that Putin “means” what he says.
This can also be applied in the United Kingdom, where evidence is mounting that Russian money and social media activities played a role in securing victory for the Brexiteers in June 2016.
In Donald Trump Thought, Putin is both a prophet and a patron saint.
Putin, like Trump, is a warrior for national greatness against the evil forces of multilateralism and cultural pluralism.
And, like Trump, he knows who his friends are.
America’s Tax-Cut Peronists
WASHINGTON, DC – Name the country.
Its leader rails against foreigners, erects various import barriers, and pushes for low interest rates and lots of cheap credit for favored sectors.
Government debt is already high, but the would-be strongman in power decides to pile on even more by increasing the budget deficit, arguing that this will boost prosperity to previously unattainable levels.
While the government claims to represent the common people, state contracts are awarded to friends of friends.
The answer, of course, is Argentina under Juan Perón, who was in power from 1946 to 1955 (and again briefly in 1973 and 1974), and many of his successors.
One of the richest countries in the world around 1900 was laid low by decades of unsustainable economic policies that made people feel good in the short run but eventually ended in disaster, such as runaway inflation, financial crisis, and periodic debt defaults.
(To be clear, Argentina’s economic policies today are quite different; for deep and up-to-date analysis, I recommend the work of my colleague Alberto Cavallo.)
But if your answer was the United States under President Donald Trump, you would not be far off.
There is reason to fear that the US is now on the path to what was previously known as Latin American populism.
Consider the remarkable volte-face of the Republican Party on fiscal responsibility.
There used to be a national debt clock in the hearing room of the House Financial Services Committee, and Republicans would rant about government profligacy as it ticked upward.
When I was in that room recently, the clock was “under repair.”
Self-proclaimed “fiscal conservatives,” such as Mick Mulvaney (a former member of the House of Representatives who now runs government finances as head of the Office of Management and Budget), are close to enacting a massive tax cut, despite knowing that it will drive up the deficit and the national debt.
Mulvaney and his colleagues could not care less.
Despite controlling both Houses of Congress and the presidency, the Republicans are beset by internal divisions.
As a result, they are finding it hard to “pay for” the tax cuts with any reduction in tax expenditures (incentives for various activities such as corporate borrowing, mortgage financing, or retirement saving).
But Republicans are deeply committed to gigantic tax cuts, in large part because their donors are demanding that they enact them.
As a result, the US will merely end up with bigger budget deficits.
Facts used to matter in Washington, at least a little bit.
But this is no longer the case in the age of Trump, at least not when it comes to taxes.
Instead, the strategy has been to state, in a bald-faced manner whatever one wants to believe and heap ill-mannered abuse on anyone who cites evidence to the contrary.
In Chapter 3 of White House Burning, James Kwak and I reviewed what happened after the tax cuts enacted in 2001 under George W. Bush.
Great promises were made about the cuts, including that they would help most Americans.
But while they did help rich people become richer, there is no evidence that they delivered faster growth or higher incomes for the middle class.
Instead, they boosted the budget deficit and contributed significantly to increasing the US national debt (by around $3 trillion through 2010), which weakened the government’s ability to respond to crises, either in terms of national security or financial instability.
I have testified repeatedly before Congress on matters of fiscal policy.
During the financial crisis of 2008-2009, Republicans were certainly interested in the facts.
But this quickly tapered off, most notably in the House of Representatives.
In fact, Kevin Brady, the representative who told me most clearly that he was not interested in looking at even moderately inconvenient facts, is now Chair of the House Ways and Means Committee, which plays a key role in what happens with taxes.
Ron Wyden, the senior Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, calls the proposed Republican tax cuts “a middle-class con job.”
He is being polite.
The cut in corporate taxes that the Republicans are likely to support will not boost wages significantly.
As the Congressional Research Service, describing the broader blueprint put forward by House Speaker Paul Ryan, has put it, “the plan’s estimated output effects appear to be limited in size and possibly negative.”
Including all possible positive effects of the Republican proposals, the Tax Policy Center has concluded that federal government “revenue would fall by between $2.4 trillion and $2.5 trillion over the first ten years and by about $3.4 trillion over the second decade.”
The Trump administration has responded to this type of sensible, fact-based analysis in the way one has come to expect: by being rude.
American populism in the Trump era, though promising great gains for working people, will in fact benefit only those who are already rich.
To be fair, this is quite a twist on anything Perón could have imagined pulling off.
The results of irresponsible populism, however, are always the same.
Populist Plutocracy and the Future of America
NEW YORK – Donald Trump won the US presidency with the backing of working-class and socially conservative white voters on a populist platform of economic nationalism.
Trump rejected the Republican Party’s traditional pro-business, pro-trade agenda, and, like Bernie Sanders on the left, appealed to Americans who have been harmed by disruptive technologies and “globalist” policies promoting free trade and migration.
But while Trump ran as a populist, he has governed as a plutocrat, most recently by endorsing the discredited supply-side theory of taxation that most Republicans still cling to.
Trump also ran as someone who would “drain the swamp” in Washington, DC, and on Wall Street.
Yet he has stacked his administration with billionaires (not just millionaires) and Goldman Sachs alumni, while letting the swamp of business lobbyists rise higher than ever.
Trump and the Republicans’ plan to repeal the 2010 Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) would have left 24 million Americans – mostly poor or middle class, many of whom voted for him – without health care.
His deregulatory policies are blatantly biased against workers and unions.
And the Republican tax-reform plan that he has endorsed would overwhelmingly favor multinational corporations and the top 1% of households, many of which stand to benefit especially from the repeal of the estate tax.
Trump has also abandoned his base in the area of trade, where he has offered rhetoric but not concrete action.
Yes, he scrapped the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), but Hillary Clinton would have done the same.
He has mused about abandoning the North American Free Trade Act (NAFTA), but that may be just a negotiating tactic.
He has threatened to impose a 50% tariff on goods from China, Mexico, and other US trade partners, but no such measures have materialized.
And proposals for a border adjustment tax have been all but forgotten.
Trump’s bullying tweets against US firms that move production offshore or undertake tax inversions have been no more than cheap talk, and business leaders know it.
Manufacturers who fooled Trump into thinking they would keep production in the US have continued to transfer operations quietly to Mexico, China, and elsewhere.
Moreover, international provisions in the pending tax legislation will give US multinationals an even greater incentive to invest, hire, and produce abroad, while using transfer pricing and other schemes to salt away profits in low-tax jurisdictions.
Likewise, despite Trump’s aggressive rhetoric on immigration, his policies have been relatively moderate, perhaps because many of the businesspeople who supported his campaign actually favor a milder approach.
The “Muslim ban” doesn’t affect the supply of labor in the US.
Although deportations have accelerated under Trump, it’s worth remembering that millions of undocumented immigrants were deported under Barack Obama, too.
The border wall that Trump was going to force Mexico to pay for remains an unfunded dream.
And even the administration’s plan to favor skilled over unskilled workers will not necessarily reduce the number of legal migrants in the country.
All told, Trump has governed like a plutocrat in populist clothes – that is, a pluto-populist.
But why has his base let him get away with pursuing policies that mostly hurt them?
According to one view, he is betting that social conservatives and white blue-collar supporters in rural areas will vote on the basis of nationalist and religious sentiment and antipathy toward secular coastal elites, rather than for their own financial interests.
But how long can anyone be expected to support “God and guns” at the expense of “bread and butter”?
The pluto-populists who presided over the Roman Empire knew that keeping the populist mob at bay required substance as well as diversion: panem et circenses – “bread and circuses.”
Raging tweets are meaningless to people who can scarcely afford a dignified living, let alone tickets to the modern-day Colosseum to watch football.
The tax legislation that Republicans have rushed through Congress could prove especially dangerous, given that millions of middle-class and low-income households will not only get little out of it, but will actually pay more when income-tax cuts are phased out over time.
Moreover, the Republican plan would repeal the Obamacare individual mandate.
According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, this will cause 13 million people to lose health insurance, and insurance premiums to rise by 10%, over the next decade.
Not surprisingly, a recent Quinnipiac poll found that a mere 29% of Americans support the Republican plan.
Nevertheless, Trump and the Republicans seem willing to risk it.
After all, by pushing the middle-class tax hikes to a later date, they have designed their plan to get them through the 2018 midterm elections and the 2020 general election.
Between now and the midterms, they can brag about cutting taxes on most households. And they can expect to see the economic-stimulus effects of tax cuts peak in 2019, just before the next presidential election – and long before the bill comes due.
Moreover, the final legislation will likely lower the federal deduction for mortgage interest and eliminate deductibility for state and local taxes.
This will hit households in Democratic-leaning states such as New York, New Jersey, and California much harder than households in Republican-leaning states.
Another part of the Republican strategy (known as “starve the beast”) will be to use the higher deficits from tax cuts to argue for cuts in so-called entitlement spending, such as Medicare, Medicaid, food stamps, and Social Security.
Again, this is a risky proposition, given that elderly, middle-class, and low-income Americans rely heavily on these programs.
Yes, the working and non-working poor who receive welfare payments or food stamps include minorities who tend to vote for Democrats.
But millions of the blue-collar, socially conservative whites who voted for Trump also rely on these and similar programs.
With the global economy expanding, Trump is probably hoping that tax cuts and deregulation will spur enough growth and create enough jobs that he will have something to brag about.
A potential growth rate of 2% won’t necessarily do much to help his blue-collar base, but at least it could push the stock market up to its highest point ever.
And, of course, Trump will still claim that the US economy can grow at a rate of 4%, even though all mainstream economists, including Republicans, agree that the potential growth rate will remain around 2%, regardless of his policies.
Whatever happens, Trump will continue to tweet maniacally, promote fake-news stories, and boast about the “biggest and best” economy ever.
In doing so, he may even create a circus worthy of a Roman emperor.
But if gassy rhetoric alone does not suffice, he may decide to go on the offensive, particularly in the international sphere.
That could mean truly withdrawing from NAFTA, taking trade action against China and other trading partners, or doubling down on harsh immigration policies.
And if these measures do not satisfy his base, Trump will still have one last option, long used by Roman emperors and other assorted dictators during times of domestic difficulty.
Namely, he can try to “wag the dog,” by fabricating an external threat or embarking on foreign military adventures to distract his supporters from what he and congressional Republicans have been doing.
For example, following the “madman” approach to foreign policy, Trump could start a war with North Korea or Iran.
Or he could post further inflammatory tweets about the evils of Islam, thereby driving disturbed and marginalized individuals into the arms of the Islamic State (ISIS) or other extremist groups.
That would increase the likelihood of ISIS-inspired attacks – for example, “lone wolves” blowing themselves up or driving trucks through crowded pedestrian areas – within the US.
With dozens, if not hundreds, slain, Trump could then wrap himself in the flag and say, “I told you so.”
And if things got bad enough, Trump and his generals could declare a state of emergency, suspend civil liberties, and transform America into a true pluto-populist authoritarian state.
You know it’s time to worry when the conservative Republican chairman of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, Bob Corker, warns openly that Trump could start World War III.
And if you’re not convinced, consider the recent history of Russia or Turkey; or the history of the Roman Empire under Caligula or Nero.
Pluto-populists have been turning democracies into autocracies with the same playbook for thousands of years. There’s no reason to think they would stop now.
The reign of Emperor Trump could be just around the corner.
Has Trump Captured the Fed?
NEW YORK – One of the important powers of any US president is to appoint members and heads of the many agencies that are responsible for implementing the country’s laws and regulations and, in many cases, governing the economy.
Perhaps no institution is more important in that regard than the Federal Reserve.
In exercising that power, Donald Trump has broken a long-standing pattern, going back almost a half-century, whereby the president reappoints (on a non-partisan basis) the incumbent Fed chair, if he or she has been seen to be doing a good job.
Probably no chair has done a better job, in a particularly difficult moment, than Janet Yellen.
Whereas her two immediate predecessors greatly tarnished the Fed’s reputation by looking the other way as massive risk was accumulating – and massive fraud occurring – within the financial sector, Yellen restored the Fed’s reputation.
Her calm and balanced hand nurtured broad consensus among a Federal Reserve Board characterized by divergent economic philosophies, and she navigated the economy through a slow recovery in a period when fiscal policy was unnecessarily constrained, as duplicitous Republicans hyped the dangers of deficits.
The Republicans’ shallow commitment to fiscal rectitude is now being exposed as they advocate massive tax cuts for corporations and billionaires that will add one and half trillion dollars to the deficit over the next decade.
To be fair, Trump chose a moderate, when many in his party were pushing for an extremist.
Trump, never shy about conflicts of interest, has an uncanny ability to embrace economic policies, such as the proposed tax cuts, that benefit him personally.
He realized that an extremist would raise interest rates – any real-estate developer’s worst nightmare.
Trump broke with precedent in another way: he chose a non-economist.
The Fed will face great challenges in the next five years, as it reverts to more normal policies.
Higher interest rates could give rise to market turmoil, as asset prices undergo a significant “correction.”
And many are expecting a major downturn in the next five years; otherwise, the economy would have experienced an almost unheard-of decade-and-a-half expansion.
While the Fed’s tool kit has been greatly expanded in the last decade, the Fed’s low interest rates and huge balance sheet – and the possibly massive increase in debt, should Trump get his tax cuts – would challenge even the best-trained economist.
Most importantly, there has been a bipartisan (and global) effort to depoliticize monetary policy.
The Fed, through its control of the money supply, has enormous economic power, and such power can easily be abused for political purposes – say, to generate more jobs in the short run.
But lack of confidence in central banks in a world of fiat money (where central banks can create money at will) weakens long-term economic performance, owing partly to fears of inflation.
Even in the absence of direct politicization, the Fed always faces a problem of “cognitive capture” by Wall Street. That’s what happened when Alan Greenspan and Ben Bernanke were in charge.
We all know the consequences: the greatest crisis in three quarters of a century, mitigated only by massive government intervention.
Yet, somehow, the Trump administration seems to have forgotten what happened less than a decade ago.
How else to explain its efforts to rescind the 2010 Dodd-Frank regulatory reforms, designed to prevent a recurrence?
The consensus beyond Wall Street is that Dodd-Frank didn’t go far enough.
Excessive risk taking and predatory behavior are still real problems, as we are frequently reminded (for example, by reports about the growing volume of subprime auto loans).
In one of the more insidious recent instances of malfeasance, bankers at Wells Fargo simply opened accounts on behalf of customers, unbeknownst to them, so that it could collect additional fees.
None of this bothers Trump, of course, who as a businessman has been no stranger to nefarious practices.
Fortunately, it appears that Powell recognizes the importance of well-designed financial regulations.
But politicization of the Fed should be viewed as just another part of Trump’s battle against what his former chief strategist, Steve Bannon, has referred to as the “administrative state.”
That battle, in turn, should be viewed as part of a larger war against the Enlightenment legacy of science, democratic governance, and the rule of law.
Upholding that legacy entails employing expertise as needed, and creating, as Edward Stiglitz of Cornell Law School has emphasized, trust in public institutions.
A large body of research now supports the idea that societies perform more poorly without such trust.
Every few days, Trump does something to rend the fabric of US society and inflame its already-deep social and partisan divisions.
The clear and present danger is that the country is growing so accustomed to Trump’s outrages that they now appear “normal.”
For more than seven decades, America has fought – often fitfully, to be sure – to redeem its stated values, taking on bigotry, fascism, and nativism in all their forms.
Now, America’s president is a misogynist, racist xenophobe whose policies embody profound contempt for the cause of human rights.
One may approve or disapprove of the Republicans’ tax proposals, efforts to “reform” health care (oblivious to the tens of millions who might lose insurance coverage), and commitment to financial deregulation (ignoring the consequences of the 2008 crisis).
But, while the Fed may be safe for now, whatever possible economic benefits this agenda could bring pale in comparison to the magnitude of the political and social risks posed by Trump’s assaults on America’s most cherished institutions and values.
Trump’s Republican Collaborators
NEW YORK – After nine months of Donald Trump’s presidency, the leaders of the Republican Party appear finally to be waking up to the harsh reality that their country stands at the edge of an abyss.
They now have a choice: they can either continue to collaborate with Trump, thereby sustaining his destructive leadership and courting disaster, or they can renounce him, finally putting their country’s democracy ahead of loyalty to their party/tribe.
Recent statements by a Republican senator from Tennessee, Bob Corker, suggest that the tide is turning against Trump.
Corker sniped that, “the White House has become an adult day care center,” before warning that Trump’s Twitter threats may put the US “on the path to World War III.”
Similarly, Senator John McCain warned of the threat posed by a “half-baked, spurious nationalism.”
But true political honor demands more than veiled condemnations (McCain did not mention Trump by name in his speech), or simply quitting, as Corker and Senior Republican Congressman Pat Tiberi of Ohio are doing.
Rather, it calls for crossing the political aisle, as Winston Churchill (no doubt a hero to all of them) did, when he switched from the Liberal to the Conservative Party.
As Churchill demonstrated, there is no shame in shifting political allegiances.
There is, however, shame in loyalty to a disgraced or deplorable party or cause.
And any Republicans today who think they can delay breaking definitively with Trump, without irreversibly damaging their own reputations, should recall the fate of others – in the Soviet Union in 1917, in Germany in 1932, and in Russia and Turkey today – who thought they could tame a monster.
Consider Nikolai Bukharin, a favorite of Vladimir Lenin and the editor of Pravda.
For more than a decade after the Bolshevik Revolution, Bukharin tried to reconcile his academic understanding of “the dictatorship of proletariat” with its real-world implementation.
This wasn’t so difficult while Lenin was in charge: despite the bloodshed the new regime engendered, mass murder wasn’t its main purpose or source of energy.
That changed with the arrival in power of Joseph Stalin, for whom terror was both a means and an end.
Nonetheless, Bukharin aligned with Stalin to purge Leon Trotsky and other Bolsheviks who sought to adhere more closely to Lenin’s dictates (and his testament against Stalin).
Bukharin reasoned that Stalin’s methods were enabling the Soviet Union’s rapid development into an industrial power, and the future of communism was far more important than the loss of a few thousand lives – or even a few million.
Bukharin would soon regret that reasoning.
Once Trotsky was out of the way, Stalin turned on all the other senior Bolsheviks, calling them “enemies of the people” – a phrase that Trump’s populist supporters, like United Kingdom’s hardline Brexiteers, have revived to denounce anyone who dares challenge their “blood and soil” code.
Bukharin was executed in 1938.
Franz von Papen also bet that he could tame a dictatorial demagogue.
To advance his own political ends, Papen persuaded German President Paul von Hindenburg to appoint Adolf Hitler as Chancellor in 1933.
A seasoned and autocratically inclined politician, Papen thought that, once Hitler was in power, he could control the Nazi leader, whom Papen regarded as a provincial blowhard.
Instead, on the Night of the Long Knives, the Nazis hunted and executed Papen’s trusted associates, Herbert von Bose and Erich Klausener, and seized control of the government.
Papen’s fate was kinder than Bukharin’s, though: Hitler shipped him off to serve as ambassador to Austria and then to Turkey.
After World War II, Papen was acquitted at the Nuremberg trials.
Boris Berezovsky, Boris Yeltsin’s trusted oligarch-henchman with his own murky reputation, similarly underestimated a would-be autocrat.
It was Berezovsky who brought Vladimir Putin to Yeltsin’s attention, anticipating that the diminutive ex-KGB officer was the ideal candidate to protect the Yeltsin family’s riches – and Berezovsky’s own wealth – once Yeltsin retired.
Yet soon after Putin was in power, Berezovsky lost his business empire and was forced to emigrate to England, where he ultimately died under suspicious circumstances.
Finally, in Turkey, President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and his predecessor Abdullah Gül worked together to create the Justice and Development Party (AKP), which has dominated Turkish politics since 2002.
But, as Erdoğan has concentrated power in his own hands, he has silenced Gül.
Likewise, former Prime Minister and AKP leader Ahmet Davutoğlu long supported Erdoğan, until deepening disagreements – at times rooted in Erdoğan’s contempt for the very position of the prime minister – forced Davutoğlu to step down last year.
Of course, America’s democracy is stronger than that of Turkey or Russia.
But with his shameless lies and relentless attacks on those who disagree with him – and his recent suggestion that it might be appropriate to “challenge” a major US news network’s broadcast license – Trump has shown that he is not interested in adhering to democratic norms.
A weakened democracy is an exceedingly high price for the US to pay – and for what?
At first, Republicans wanted to use Trump to help them pass legislation such as a repeal of the 2010 Affordable Care Act (“Obamacare”) and tax reform.
But, after ten months of controlling the presidency and both houses of Congress, Republicans have accomplished almost nothing legislatively.
At this point, it seems that they simply want power for power’s sake – and that means beating, not cooperating with, the Democrats.
But that may be changing.
Congressional Republicans have already joined with Democrats to enact “Trump-proof” sanctions against Russia, and lately there have been moves toward cooperation on maintaining the subsidies on which Obamacare depends (after Trump cut them by executive order).
These are steps in the right direction.
But, with Trump’s behavior becoming increasingly capricious and dangerous, it is not nearly enough.
Republicans who care about ending up on the right side of history cannot stay on Trump’s side any longer.
The US Donor Relief Act of 2017
NEW YORK – Never has a piece of legislation labeled as both a tax cut and a reform been received with as much disapproval and derision as the bill passed by the US Congress and signed into law by President Donald Trump just before Christmas.
The Republicans who voted for the bill (no Democrats did) claim that their gift will come to be appreciated later, as Americans see their take-home pay go up.
They are almost certainly wrong.
Rather, the bill wraps into one package all that is wrong with the Republican Party, and to some extent, the debased state of American democracy.
The legislation is not “tax reform” by even the most elastic reading.
Reform entails closing distortionary loopholes and increasing the fairness of the tax code.
Central to fairness is the ability to pay.
But this tax legislation reduces taxes by tens of thousands of dollars, on average, for those most able to pay (the top quintile).
And, when fully implemented (in 2027), it will increase taxes on a majority of Americans in the middle (the second, third, and fourth quintiles).
The US tax code was already regressive long before Trump’s presidency.
Indeed, the billionaire investor Warren Buffett, one of the wealthiest men in the world, famously complained that it was wrong that he paid a lower tax rate than his secretary.
The new legislation makes America’s tax system even more regressive.
It is now universally recognized that growing inequality is a key economic problem in the United States, with those at the top capturing almost all the gains in GDP over the past quarter-century.
The new legislation adds insult to injury: rather than offsetting this disturbing trend, the Republicans’ “reform” gives even more to the top.
A more distorted economy is not a healthy economy.
The International Monetary Fund has emphasized that a more unequal society worsens economic performance – and the new tax legislation will lead inexorably to a more unequal society.
Much of the complexity and distortion in the US tax code arises from different types of income being taxed at different rates.
Such differential treatment leads not only to the (correct) perception that the tax code is unfair, but also to inefficiencies: resources move to favored sectors, and are wasted as firms try to convert their incomes and activities into the more favored forms.
The worst provisions of the old tax code – such as the carried-interest loophole, which allows job-destroying private-equity firms to pay taxes at low rates – have been retained, and new categories of favored income (earned by so-called pass-through entities) have been created.
The hoped-for spur to economic growth is unlikely to materialize, for several reasons.
First, the economy is already at or near full employment.
If the US Federal Reserve comes to view that to be the case, it will raise interest rates at the first sign of a significant increase in aggregate demand.
And higher interest rates mean that investment, and thus growth, will slow, even if the consumption of the very rich increases.
Moreover, squeezing the “blue” (Democratic) states, including California and New York, by including provisions in the tax bill aimed specifically at them, not only further widens America’s political divide; it’s also bad economics.
No sane government would undermine the most dynamic parts of its economy, and yet that is what the Trump administration is doing.
Special tax breaks for the real-estate sector may help Trump and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, but it does not make America great or competitive.
And limiting the deductibility of state income tax and property tax will almost surely reduce investment in education and infrastructure – again, not a sound strategy for increasing American competitiveness.
Other new provisions will also hurt the US economy.
Because the fiscal deficit will increase – the only question is by how much, with my bet being that it will be far larger than current estimates of $1-1.5 trillion – the trade deficit will increase as well, regardless of whether Trump pursues more nativist/protectionist policies.
Lower exports and higher imports will further undermine US manufacturing.
Once again (as he has done with health care and the tax cuts), Trump is betraying his core supporters.
But the Republican Party is cynical.
Its leaders are stuffing themselves at the trough – Trump, Kushner, and many others in his administration are among the biggest winners – thinking that this may be their last chance at such a feast.
And no Republican believes the party can get away with it more firmly than Trump does.
That is why the legislation is structured to give individuals temporary tax cuts, with corporations getting a permanent reduction in their tax rate.
The Republicans seem confident that voters will not see beyond the next paycheck.
But voters are not so easily manipulated: they have seen through the trick, and are rightly convinced by the numerous studies, from sources in and out of government, showing that the lion’s share of the tax cut goes to corporations and the very rich.
Trump’s tax legislation also attests to many Republicans’ belief that dollars are more important than voters.
All that matters is pleasing their corporate sponsors, who will reward the party with contributions, which will be used to buy votes, thereby ensuring the perpetuation of a corporate-driven political agenda.
Let’s hope that Americans really are smarter than the greedy corporate CEOs and their cynical Republican servants believe.
With midterm congressional elections coming in November, they will have ample opportunity to prove it.
Trump’s Bigger Russia Problem
WASHINGTON, DC – Shortly before taking office, US President Donald Trump took to Twitter to outline his vision for his country’s relationship with Russia.
“Having a good relationship with Russia is a good thing, not a bad thing,” he declared in one tweet.
“When I am President,” he proclaimed in another, Russia and the US “will, perhaps, work together to solve some of the many great and pressing problems and issues of the WORLD!”
Of course, Trump is not wrong to try to improve relations with Russia.
(The last several US presidents all sought the same goal.)
But he must recognize that achieving that objective is not worth selling Russia’s pro-democratic activists down the river.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has effectively eliminated popular dissent in Russia.
In 2012, soon after Putin’s return to the presidency, the Duma enacted the so-called foreign agent law, which focused on silencing organizations that receive funding from abroad and engage in anything that can be labeled “political activity.”
Since then, Russia’s government has unilaterally declared 88 organizations to be “foreign agents” – a term that sounds a lot like “spy.”
The list includes a respected election-monitoring group, human-rights activists, pollsters, and even some scientific research groups.
Their mandates vary, but the government’s message to them and others is clear: be critical of the Kremlin, and you will be silenced.
Russia’s government has taken several more steps to suppress dissent over the last five years, including labeling as “undesirable” several international organizations that have supported democracy activists and criminalizing Russian citizens’ involvement with them.
It has also expanded the security agencies’ authority to track citizens’ online activities and curtail their right to free speech, while intensifying discrimination against LGBTQ+ individuals and persecuting religious groups.
And Kremlin critics have been arrested and even assassinated.
Such activities have apparently not fazed Trump.
Even after the detention of thousands of anti-corruption protesters in more than 100 cities across Russia in March, the Trump administration issued only a tepid statement.
On his visit to Moscow the following month, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson mirrored this approach, eschewing the State Department tradition of meeting publicly with civil-society activists, despite urging from the US Congress.
Trump and Tillerson, it seems, are fully willing to ignore the Kremlin’s repression of its opponents – not to mention its interference in America’s own democratic election, new evidence of which emerges almost daily – if it means avoiding uncomfortable conversations with Putin.
They evidently believe that this approach has yielded results – most notably the fragile Syrian ceasefire that the US and Russia brokered in July.
But Russia took that deal out of self-interest, not because of the Trump administration’s obsequiousness.
In fact, it is American interests that are being undermined by the Trump administration’s determination not to poke the Russian bear.
Whatever short-term “win” Trump might be able to secure by pandering to Russia, it means little compared to America’s long-term interest in the life, liberty, and equality of all human beings, as well as in the safeguarding of self-government.
This is not to say that the US should not engage or collaborate with governments that operate on different principles.
But we must be clear about what we are not willing to accept – beginning with the quashing of political dissent.
Upholding America’s core principles is not just the right thing to do; it is smart strategy.
Putin’s authority may appear unshakeable, but it is actually propped up by propaganda and fear.
When the US betrays its own values to avoid challenging Russia, it strengthens Putin’s hand considerably.
Meanwhile, the perception that he has the US on the ropes enables Putin to continue silencing his opponents.
In the run-up to next year’s presidential election, Putin will not hesitate to take advantage of the leeway foreign leaders give him.
Already, he has ensured that the opposition leader Alexei Navalny was convicted of embezzlement, giving the government an excuse to bar him from the ballot.
But Navalny, who has already withstood years of Kremlin pressure, will not give up so easily; nor will other opposition activists.
Earlier this month, more than 200 Putin opponents won seats on local councils in Moscow’s municipal elections.
Anti-corruption protests have continued throughout the year.
And Navalny has just released a new exposé on Putin’s secret dacha near the border with Finland.
To be sure, Putin is expected to win a fourth term in office easily.
But he will not lead Russia forever.
Until then, the entire Russian population deserves to participate in democratic elections.
Yet none of those held during Putin’s long tenure has been assessed as free or fair by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.
By extending public support to election monitors and activists working to uphold democratic principles, the Trump administration could hearten the Russian opposition and advance a different vision for Russia’s future.
In the short term, a little hypocrisy may seem like a small price to pay for a quick victory.
But both US foreign policy and America’s national narrative are long games.
And, in the long term, the US would be much better off engaging with a democratic Russia where human rights were protected and political dissent tolerated.
Russia’s 2018 elections represent an important opportunity for Trump to advocate for such an outcome, and prove that American values are not up for negotiation.
The US would not stoop to Putin’s level and interfere covertly in Russia’s electoral processes.
But it should stand up for democracy and human rights – and stand with those who aspire to build free societies.
The world must know that the US still has a soul.
Trump’s Gift to Europe
OXFORD – At a recent conference in France, a number of Europeans surprised their American guests by arguing that US President Donald Trump might be good for Europe.
With Trump returning to Europe for the G20 summit in Hamburg, it’s worth asking whether they are right.
By most accounts, Trump’s presidency has been terrible for Europe.
He seems to disdain the European Union.
His relationship with German Chancellor Angela Merkel is cool in comparison to his friendship with Turkey’s authoritarian president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, or his admiration for Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Moreover, Trump welcomes Britain’s looming exit from the EU; upon meeting Prime Minister Theresa May for the first time, he is alleged to have asked enthusiastically, “Who’s next?”
Finally, Trump only belatedly reaffirmed NATO’s Article 5 (which pledges mutual defense); he withdrew the US from the Paris climate agreement, which is very popular in Europe; and he has cut US funds for the United Nations, which has strong European support.
Not surprisingly, Trump is personally unpopular across Europe.
In a recent Pew poll indicates that only 22% of Britons, 14% of French, and 11% of Germans have confidence in him.
But this very unpopularity – more anti-Trump than anti-American – has helped to reinforce European values.
Earlier in the year, there was a fear that a rising tide of the type of nationalist populism that brought Trump to office and led to Brexit might be about to sweep Europe, even giving the far-right Marine Le Pen the French presidency.
Instead, the populist wave seemed to have crested with Trump’s election.
Since then, populists have been defeated in Austria and the Netherlands; the French elected Emmanuel Macron, a centrist newcomer; and May, the champion of a “hard” Brexit, lost her parliamentary majority in last month’s snap general election.
Europe still confronts the slow growth, high unemployment, and political disunity that have plagued it in the decade since the 2008 global financial crisis.
But whoever wins the German election this September will be a moderate, not an extreme nationalist, and will understand the importance of working with Macron to restart the Franco-German engine of European progress.
The Brexit negotiations promise to be complex and contentious.
For “soft Brexiteers,” who want to preserve Britain’s access to the European single market, the problem is that the Brexit vote mainly reflected concerns about immigration, not about the minutiae of the single market’s rules.
Yet Europe refuses to allow goods and services to flow freely without free movement of people.
Some three million Europeans currently live in Britain, and a million Britons reside in Europe.
A possible compromise could be found by creating a new Euro-British entity, one that would guarantee the rights of both sides’ citizens while allowing some limits on immigration as well as on some goods.
One could think of this entity in terms of concentric circles, with free movement characterizing the inner circle of the EU and constraints allowed in the outer circle.
Whether such compromises will be possible depends upon European flexibility.
In the past, Europeans have talked about allowing “variable speeds” toward the implied goal of “ever closer union.”
This federal goal would have to be replaced, and a metaphor of different levels would have to replace that of different speeds.
Many Europeans elites have already become more flexible regarding Europe’s future and have moved past the federalist goal to envision a European entity that is sui generis.
They point out that three different levels of participation already exist in Europe: the customs union, the euro currency, and the Schengen Agreement on the removal of internal borders.
Defense could become a fourth.
In the past, European progress on cooperation in defense has been inhibited not only by concerns about sovereignty, but also by the security guarantee offered by the United States.
With Trump raising doubts about American reliability, the security issue has moved to the foreground.
Efforts to build a common European defense system have begun, but the process is slow.
Other than Britain, only the French have major expeditionary force capabilities, while Germany has been inhibited by history from doing more.
And Britain was always reluctant to do anything that might compete with NATO.
But these attitudes are beginning to change.
Again, the image of concentric circles can help.
In the run-up to the Iraq war in the early 2000s, some argued that, in terms of security, Americans are from Mars, while Europeans are from Venus.
But the world has changed, and Europe now faces a series of external threats.
Russia’s attacks on Georgia and Ukraine have reminded Europeans of the dangers they face from their large neighbor.
Deterring Russia will still require a strong NATO.
Another set of threats, however, could come from violence in the Balkans.
Some observers believe that civil war was only narrowly averted recently in Macedonia.
A European peacekeeping force could make a major contribution to stability in the region.
A third set of threats to Europe originates in North Africa and the Middle East.
Libya is in chaos and the source of dangerous Mediterranean voyages by desperate migrants, and one can also imagine the need to protect citizens or rescue hostages in the region.
Here the French expeditionary capability, perhaps coupled with Britain’s, could help provide security.
Even if Britain does not participate, other Europeans could help, as Germany now does in dealing with terrorism in Mali.
Europe is a long way from a common defense structure, but the need is growing.
And, ironically, the unpopular Trump may prove more of a help than a hindrance.
Trump’s Tax Plan and the Dollar
CAMBRIDGE – Now that Donald Trump has been elected President of the United States and Republicans control both houses of Congress, corporate tax reform is coming to America.
The package currently being discussed includes two important features: a cut in the tax rate, from 35% currently to 20% or even 15%; and a “border-adjustment” tax, which is typical of a value-added-tax (VAT) regime, but unusual for corporate taxes.
A border-adjustment tax would treat domestically purchased inputs and imported inputs differently, and encourage exports.
Corporations would no longer be able to deduct the costs of imported inputs from their taxable income; but, at the same time, their export-sales revenue would not be taxed.
The proposal has generated an intense debate about whether it will improve the US trade balance.
Having published our own work on “fiscal devaluations,” we believe that a border-adjustment tax would have minimal prospects for success, and that it could significantly undermine America’s net foreign-asset position.
The idea of using fiscal-policy instruments to improve trade competitiveness dates back to John Maynard Keynes.
In his 1931 Macmillan Report to the British Parliament, Keynes proposed that an import tariff be paired with an export subsidy, which would mimic the effects of exchange-rate devaluation, while maintaining the gold-pound parity.
In our own work, we have demonstrated that, in addition to this policy combination, countries that maintain a fixed exchange rate or are in a currency union can achieve the same effect by raising their VAT and cutting payroll taxes by equivalent amounts.
This tax-swap policy has received a lot of attention in the eurozone, with Germany implementing it in 2006, and France in 2012.
The incoming Trump administration’s proposal to cut corporate-tax rates and impose a border-adjustment tax is similar to the VAT-payroll tax swap, because both strategies raise the cost of imports and subsidize exports.
But we do not expect such a strategy to improve US competitiveness for the simple reason that the US authorities maintain a flexible exchange rate.
If Trump’s proposed tax reforms are implemented in full, the dollar will appreciate along with demand for US goods: a 20% tax cut will push the value of the dollar up by 20%.
And this, in turn, will offset any competitiveness gains.
The only way that this would not happen is if the US Federal Reserve prevented the dollar from appreciating by lowering interest rates. But this would fuel domestic inflation, so there is no reason to believe that the Fed would take such a step.
Thus, while a border-adjustment tax can benefit countries that have a fixed exchange rate or are in a currency union, it basically has nothing to offer countries with floating exchange rates, because the resulting currency appreciation offsets the fiscal devaluation.
But the effect of a US border-adjustment tax would not be neutral.
An appreciating dollar would erode America’s net foreign-asset position, because an overwhelming 85% of its foreign liabilities are denominated in dollars, while around 70% of its foreign assets are denominated in a foreign currency.
With US foreign assets amounting to 140% of its GDP, and its foreign liabilities amounting to 180% of GDP, a dollar appreciation of 20% would result in a capital loss equal to about 13% of GDP.
The fiscal consequences of Trump’s proposals would be mixed.
On one hand, the border-adjustment tax could push up tax revenues, because the US imports more than it exports.
With the US trade deficit at 4% of GDP, a 20% border-adjustment tax would create additional tax revenues equal to about 0.8% of GDP.
On the other hand, the lower corporate-income-tax rate would decrease revenues and essentially cancel out any gains from the tax on imports.
To be sure, a border-adjustment tax would have other benefits that we have not discussed.
It might generate additional tax revenues, by discouraging international companies from engaging in “transfer pricing” between their subsidiaries, or from shifting profits to low-tax countries.
And, of course, lower tax rates could provide an economic stimulus and decrease the budget deficit.
But in terms of international competitiveness, the bottom line is that Trump’s proposed tax plan – particularly the border-adjustment tax – would most likely not have a positive impact on the US trade balance.
Worse, it could be very costly in terms of US net foreign assets.
Donald the Destroyer
WASHINGTON, DC – Donald Trump, the Republican Party’s presumptive nominee to contest the United States’ presidential election in November, is clearly not a standard Republican.
The party’s leaders and elected officials fought against him during the primary, and many are still reluctant to endorse him.
Trump is now aligning some of his policy proposals with mainstream Republican ideas, but he is also clearly determined to retain his distinctive identity.
The resulting ideological mix comprises three main components: virulent anti-immigrant animus, ignorant anti-trade rhetoric, and extreme anti-government sentiment.
Taken separately, any one of these would be damaging.
Together, they would deal a major blow to US and global prosperity, while also weakening national and international security.
Without question, Trump is the most anti-immigrant presidential candidate the US has seen in modern times.
His first idea and overriding catchphrase is to “build a wall” along the country’s southern border, which would supposedly keep out Mexican and other Latin immigrants.
He also wants to deport 11 million people and keep out all Muslims.
This is a recipe for a police state – checking identities, raiding people’s houses, and encouraging neighbors to inform on one another.
It is also fundamentally anti-American, in the sense of undermining everything that the country has achieved.
The US is a nation of immigrants – the best in the world at integrating new arrivals.
After one generation in the country, no one cares where your family came from.
Trump – and those who bring him to power – would throw all of this out of the window.
The associated social disruption would by itself cause not just an economic slowdown, but a sustained decline in GDP and incomes.
The Trump campaign’s anti-trade stance is similarly shocking, including to the business community.
Trump genuinely wants to confront China and other countries with a potential trade war, ignoring completely the impact on the US (where exports account for around 14% of total economic activity).
The US has spent the past 70 years helping to build a global system that, despite its flaws, for the most part enables countries to trade peacefully and across great distances.
Trump’s vow to tear up the rules is a recipe for another Great Depression, with massive unemployment and millions of people unable to pay their mortgages, student loans, and other debts.
Trump has added some themes from the Republicans’ traditional anti-government agenda, but with his own grandiose twists.
Financial reform would be repealed completely, regardless of the consequences.
The US would return to the arrangements that brought the world’s financial system to the brink of complete collapse in 2008 – and caused the country to lose at least one year’s GDP (more than $20 trillion).
Moreover, Trump’s proposed tax cuts would be very large – thus increasing the federal budget deficit and driving up national debt substantially.
Trump will rely on the standard Republican claim that the tax cuts will “pay for themselves” or lead to rapid growth.
Such claims are completely at odds with modern American experience, including under George W. Bush.
This approach to economic policy is classic populism: Promise voters impossible things, particularly when the negative fallout from the promises becomes apparent only well down the road.
If Trump were elected, Americans could expect the same sort of economic cycle seen repeatedly in places like Argentina over the past 100 years.
Inequality would widen, with great wealth for the few and low wages for the many, followed by a traumatic bust – in which the wealthy again do fine, the middle class is ground down to poverty, and the social safety net is ripped to shreds.
In our book White House Burning, James Kwak and I emphasized that fiscal sustainability is important not just for economic prosperity but also for national security.
In 1814, the British were able to burn down the White House (and most other official buildings in Washington, DC) because American politicians had almost completely undermined the central government’s fiscal capacity.
The US had no effective navy, a weak army, and insufficient ability to mobilize in the face of an obvious national emergency.
Trump’s promise to “Make America Great Again” is a political swindle.
Populists will promise anything, including policies that are untenable or that will lead to certain disaster.
Trump’s proposed policies are no different: They would undermine America’s security, depress its economy, and destroy the financial system.
The authoritarian populism that Trump embodies has challenged democracies at least since the end of the Roman Republic.
Authoritarians have always beaten up their opponents – physically, in the courts, and now on Twitter – to make them keep quiet.
Trump’s opponents must not be intimidated.
His rise represents the most profound challenge to American democracy since Germany invaded Poland in 1939.
Rejection of his candidacy is necessary to keep America and the world safe.
Giving Democracy the Finger
DENVER – Some of the most iconic – and perhaps misleading – news images of the twenty-first century were of smiling Iraqis holding up their purple-ink-stained index fingers to show that they had voted in their country’s January 2005 election.
For many, it was the first vote they had ever cast.
The purported story behind the images was that democracy had finally arrived in Iraq.
A system without elections cannot claim to be a democracy.
So, for many, seeing images of a well-run voting process (the ink stains prevented voters from casting more than one ballot) was proof enough that things had changed.
But democracy is an exceedingly complex system, and free elections are only one feature.
An absence of elections certainly implies an absence of democracy.
But it does not follow that the inverse is also true.
Elections are a necessary but insufficient condition of democracy, which also requires durable institutions that embody democratic values.
Today, more and more countries hold elections, and yet democracy itself is in peril.
Across developed and developing countries, violation of the public trust and failure to protect democratic institutions are straining systems of checks and balances that, in some cases, have been in place for centuries.
Assaults on democratic institutions are not limited to countries with little democratic experience. They can be seen almost everywhere, including in the world’s oldest existing democracy, namely the United States.
In the West, extolling the virtues of democracy to others has long resembled proselytization of a secular religion, complete with the threat of fire and brimstone for those who do not embrace the democratic creed.
But the developed world’s lectures to the developing world were never particularly useful.
Years ago, after an event in which an international philanthropist lectured about democracy for hours before flying into the sunset on his private jet, a Balkan prime minister in attendance asked me, “What am I supposed to do with that?”
While he was on the front lines grappling with sensitive issues relating to ethnic minorities, interlopers were offering him a constant stream of take-it-or-else advice for which they would never have to assume responsibility.
Now, the pendulum has swung in the opposite direction, especially with respect to US foreign policy.
Under President Donald Trump’s administration, the American government does not even bother to pay lip service to democracy anymore.
To be sure, this partly reflects fatigue from decades of democracy promotion on the part of the West.
But it is more than that.
Democracy is being directly threatened in the country where it should have the deepest cultural and political roots.
Trump does not just want to avoid repeating the failed policies of the past, as he puts it.
He and his supporters also have taken aim at the fundamental institutions upon which American democracy is based, including the courts, the legislative branch, the independent media, and more.
The nineteenth-century Prussian military officer and theorist Carl von Clausewitz spoke presciently about the age of total war that would arrive less than a century after his death.
What he did not address was the coming age of total politics, whereby all of a society’s institutions would be pressed into the service of a totalizing ideological struggle.
America is now in the midst of such a struggle, and how we manage it will inform how other countries handle similar struggles of their own.
America’s crisis at home is now preventing it from performing its traditional international role as both a source of institutional reassurance and an agent of change.
Throughout the post-war period, the US has backstopped collective security through NATO and other institutions, and it has been more than willing to brave regional and global threats, often with few friends at its side.
Sadly, Trump shows little respect for this legacy, or for America’s tradition of optimism and confidence in its institutions.
He either doesn’t realize or doesn’t care that the American system of governance has been the main source of the country’s global prestige.
Instead, he rejects America’s historical ascent, and reframes it as a parable of self-delusion and naiveté, wherein the US puts on a lavish feast for the world’s freeloaders.
Already, America’s silence is deafening.
In Syria, the US has ceded the field to others, even though the fight there could determine the future of the Muslim Middle East.
Meanwhile, the Trump administration’s rejection of trans-oceanic trade and investment pacts has confused its friends and emboldened its rivals.
The US Department of State, regardless of what its beleaguered chief, Rex Tillerson, might say, now lacks global reach.
And without proactive diplomacy, the US will quickly be eclipsed internationally, namely by China.
But Trump won an election in 2016, so he is holding up a stained finger as if that is the only thing that matters.
In the coming year, it will be up to Americans of all stripes to hold up their own – and to make clear that democracy is about much, much more.
Preparing for the Trump Trade Wars
LONDON – Is US President Donald Trump what Maoists used to call a paper tiger, or should his noisy threats be taken seriously?
That question has loomed particularly large over the North Korean nuclear issue.
But after Trump’s fairly emollient 12-day tour of Asia, fears of a conflict on the Korean Peninsula have ebbed somewhat.
And yet that same tour raised another threat, which the world has every reason to take seriously.
In the second year of his presidency, Trump’s administration will likely set its sights on trade, suggesting that the prospect of more trade wars will increase substantially.
In his first year in office, Trump has often huffed and puffed about other countries’ unfair trade practices, just as he did during the 2016 election campaign; but he has done little to turn words into deeds.
This inaction is understandable.
Trump is relying on China – one of America’s largest trade partners – to apply pressure on the North Korean regime, while US businesses have lobbied vigorously against any measures that might inhibit trade.
Still, Trump’s apparent restraint cannot be expected to last.
Trade is one of the few policy areas where he can be said to have an ideology.
The “logic” of that ideology holds that trade deficits are proof of unfair practices by other countries, and should thus be met with tough and decisive action.
Moreover, Trump has a compelling political interest in maintaining the support of his core supporters.
After Twitter, Trump’s trade rhetoric is his most powerful weapon.
It is never too early to start building a case for re-election in 2020.
Until now, Trump has been willing to hold back on the trade issue until the Republican Party’s planned tax overhaul makes its way through Congress.
He does not want to risk disrupting his and his party’s last chance to secure a real legislative victory this year.
Once tax legislation is off the table – and especially if it fails ignominiously in the same manner as the Republicans’ health-care-reform effort earlier this year – Trump will want to show that he means what he has said on trade.
Trade is at the center of Trump’s “America First” approach, which he claims will protect and even restore lost American jobs.
While some in Trump’s cabinet might reject efforts to apply the slogan to the issues they oversee, Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross, US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, and National Trade Council Director Peter Navarro all share Trump’s views on trade.
Each agrees that America’s big bilateral trade deficits with countries such as China, Japan, Germany, and Mexico are proof that America is being taken for a ride by its competitors.
Trump and his trade advisers believe that by reducing or even eliminating those deficits, they can create well-paid jobs for American workers.
Trump made his views clear in a speech at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in Da Nang, Vietnam, on November 10.
“We are not going to let the United States be taken advantage of anymore,” he said. “I wish previous administrations in my country saw what was happening and did something about it.
They did not, but I will.”
But what concrete actions will Trump actually take?
So far, he has abandoned the 12-country Trans-Pacific Partnership – which his election opponent, Hillary Clinton, had also promised to do – and opened negotiations with Mexico and Canada to update the North American Free-Trade Agreement, which President Bill Clinton signed into law in 1994.
This is minor stuff.
But next year, Trump can be expected to turn rhetoric into action on two main fronts.
The first is China, which Trump has singled out as the greatest trade exploiter of the US.
Unless the North Korea standoff escalates critically, he will likely initiate anti-dumping actions against Chinese industries – notably in steel – deemed to be selling their goods below cost; and he will probably launch a broad assault on intellectual-property violations in China.
These measures will almost certainly provoke retaliation from China.
China feels stronger than ever in the Trump era, and in the eyes of Chinese cadres, not responding forcefully would be a sign of weakness.
The other main front for Trump is the World Trade Organization, which America helped establish in the early 1990s as a successor to the post-war General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
Lighthizer has gone on record to describe the WTO’s dispute-settlement system as harmful to America.
And already, the Trump administration is blocking the appointment of new judges to WTO arbitration panels.
If it maintains that policy, the WTO’s entire dispute-settlement system will be crippled within months.
With the WTO essentially out of the picture, the US will launch a new initiative to strike bilateral deals on trade rules – an approach that Trump advocated in his APEC speech.
Given that the US remains a vital market for most exporters, such an initiative will have clout.
Asian and European countries, in particular, should be preparing for the worst by negotiating their own trade agreements with one another to preempt American mercantilism.
After all, taking the initiative to boost trade and other commercial contacts is the best way to resist a trade war.
By reviving the TPP without US involvement, Japan and other Asia-Pacific countries are already on the right track.
But if a Trump trade war is in the offing, they – and other countries – will need to double down on that approach.
Trump’s Gathering Trade War
NEW HAVEN – During his campaign, US President-elect Donald Trump used foreign trade as a lightning rod in his supposed defense of the beleaguered American middle class.
This is not an uncommon tactic for candidates at either end of the political spectrum.
What is unusual is that Trump has not moderated his anti-trade tone since winning.
Instead, he has upped the ante and fired a series of early warning shots in what could turn into a full-blown global trade war, with disastrous consequences for the United States and the rest of the world.
Consider Trump’s key personnel decisions.
Industrialist Wilbur Ross, the Commerce Secretary-designate, has been vocal in his desire to abrogate America’s “dumb” trade deals.
Peter Navarro, an economics professor at the University of California at Irvine, will be the director of the National Trade Council – a new White House policy shop to be set up on a par with the National Security Council and the National Economic Council.
Navarro is one of America’s most extreme China hawks.
The titles of his two most recent books – Death by China (2011) and Crouching Tiger: What China’s Militarism Means for the World (2015) – speak volumes about his tabloid-level biases.
Ross and Navarro were also co-authors of an economic-policy position paper published on the Trump campaign website that stretched any semblance of credibility.
Now they will get the opportunity to put their ideas into practice.
And, in fact, the process has already begun.
Trump has made it clear that he will immediately withdraw the US from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) – in keeping with Ross’s criticism of America’s trade deals.
And his brazen willingness to challenge the 40-year-old “One China” policy by speaking directly with Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen – to say nothing of his subsequent anti-China tweets – leaves little doubt that his administration will follow Navarro’s prescription and take dead aim at America’s largest and most powerful trading partner.
Of course, Trump, a self-proclaimed master dealmaker, may simply be talking tough, in order to put China and the world on notice that the US is now prepared to operate from a position of strength in the foreign-trade arena.
A bold opening gambit, the argument goes, softens the adversary for a more palatable endgame.
But, while such tough talk undoubtedly played well with voters, it fails a key reality check: America’s large trade deficit – a visible manifestation of its low saving – calls into question the very notion of economic strength.
A significant domestic saving deficit, such as that which afflicts the US, accounts for America’s insatiable appetite for surplus saving from abroad, which in turn spawns its chronic current-account deficit and a massive trade deficit.
Dealmakers who try to address this macroeconomic problem one country at a time cannot possibly succeed: the US ran trade deficits with 101 countries in 2015.
There can be no bilateral fix for a multilateral problem.
It’s like the proverbial Dutch boy sticking his finger in a leaky dike.
Unless the source of the problem – a saving shortfall that is likely to worsen in the face of Trump’s inevitable widening of federal budget deficits –is addressed, America’s current-account and trade deficits will only widen.
Squeezing China would merely shift the trade imbalance to other countries – most likely to higher-cost producers, which would effectively raise the prices of foreign goods sold to hard-pressed American families.
But the story doesn’t end there.
The Trump administration is playing with live ammunition, implying profound, global repercussions.
Nowhere is this more evident than in the likely Chinese response to America’s new muscle-flexing.
The Trump team is dismissive of China’s reaction to its threats – believing that the US has nothing to lose and everything to gain.
Alas, that may not be the case.
Like it or not, America and China are locked in a codependent economic relationship.
Yes, China depends on US demand for its exports, but the US also depends on China: the Chinese own over $1.5 trillion in US Treasury securities and other US dollar-based assets.
Moreover, China is America’s third-largest export market (after Canada and Mexico) and the one that is expanding most rapidly – hardly inconsequential for a growth-starved US economy.
It is foolish to think that America holds all the cards in this bilateral economic relationship.
Codependency is a very reactive connection.
If one partner changes the terms of engagement, the other is likely to respond in kind.
If the US goes after China – as Trump, Navarro, and Ross have long advocated and now seem to be doing – it must also face the consequences.
On the economic front, that spells the possibility of reciprocal tariffs on US exports to China, as well as potential ramifications for Chinese purchases of Treasuries.
And other countries – tightly linked to China through global supply chains – may well impose countervailing tariffs of their own.
Global trade wars are rare.
But, like military conflicts, they often start with accidental skirmishes or misunderstandings.
More than 85 years ago, US Senator Reed Smoot and Representative Willis Hawley fired the first shot in sponsoring the Tariff Act of 1930.
That led to a catastrophic global trade war, which many believe turned a serious recession into the Great Depression.
It is the height of folly to ignore the lessons of history.
For today’s saving-short, deficit-prone US economy, it will take far more than China-bashing to make America great again.
Turning trade into a weapon of mass economic destruction could be a policy blunder of epic proportions.
A Trump Christmas Carol
NEW YORK – This Christmas, America’s gift to the world was a $285 million cut in the United Nations’ regular budget.
Technically, the UN regular budget reflects a consensus decision of the body’s 193 member states, but the United States was clearly the prime mover in pushing for the cut.
Indeed, Nikki Haley, the US ambassador to the UN, accompanied the Christmas Eve announcement with a warning that the US would be on the lookout for further reductions.
Ebenezer Scrooge could not have done better.
The budget cuts will make it that much harder for UN agencies to prevent wars, help millions of people displaced by conflicts, feed and clothe hungry children, fight emerging diseases, provide safe water and sanitation, and promote access to education and health care for the poor.
President Donald Trump and Haley make much of the bloated costs of UN operations, and there certainly is room for some trimming.
But the world receives an astounding return on its investments in the UN, and member countries should be investing far more, not less, in its organizations and programs.
Consider the sums. The UN regular budget for the two-year period 2018-2019 will stand at around $5.3 billion, $285 million less than the 2016-2017 budget.
Annual spending will be around $2.7 billion.
The US share will be 22%, or around $580 million per year, equivalent to around $1.80 per American per year.
What will Americans get for their $1.80 per year?
For starters, the UN regular budget includes the operations of the General Assembly, the Security Council, and the Secretariat (including the Secretary-General’s office, the Department for Economic and Social Affairs, the Department of Political Affairs, and administrative staff).
When a dire threat to peace arises, such as the current standoff between the US and North Korea, it is the UN’s Department of Political Affairs that often facilitates vital, behind-the-scenes diplomacy.
In addition, the UN regular budget includes allocations for the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF), the UN Development Program, the World Health Organization, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, the UN’s regional bodies (for Asia, Africa, Europe, Latin America), the UN Environment Program, the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (for disaster response), the World Meteorological Organization, the UN Office on Drugs and Crime, UN Women (for women’s rights), and many other agencies, each specializing in global responses to crises, conflicts, poverty, displacement, environmental hazards, diseases, or other public needs.
Many of the UN organizations receive additional “voluntary” contributions from individual countries interested in supporting specialized initiatives by agencies such as UNICEF and the World Health Organization.
After all, those agencies have a unique global mandate and political legitimacy, and the capacity to operate in all parts of the world.
The silliness of the US attack on the size of the UN budget is best seen by comparing it to the Pentagon’s budget.
The US currently spends around $700 billion per year on defense, or roughly $2 billion per day.
Thus, the total annual UN regular budget amounts to around one day and nine hours of US military spending.
The US share of the UN regular budget equals roughly seven hours of Pentagon spending.
Some waste.
Trump and Haley are squeezing the UN budget for three reasons.
The first is to play to Trump’s political base.
Most Americans recognize the enormous value of the UN and support it, but the right-wing fringe among Republican voters views the UN as an affront to the US.
A 2016 Pew Survey put US public approval of the UN at 64%, with just 29% viewing it unfavorably.
Yet the Texas Republican Party, for example, has repeatedly called on the US to leave the UN.
The second reason is to save on wasteful programs, which is necessary in any ongoing organization.
The mistake is to slash the overall budget, rather than reallocate funds and increase outlays on vitally needed programs that fight hunger and disease, educate children, and prevent conflicts.
The third, and most dangerous reason for cutting the UN’s budget is to weaken multilateralism in the name of American “sovereignty.”
America is sovereign, Trump and Haley insist, and therefore can do what it wants, regardless of opposition by the UN or any other group of countries.
In her recent speech to the UN General Assembly session on Jerusalem, where member states overwhelmingly rejected America’s unilateral recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, Haley told the rest of the world: “America will put our embassy in Jerusalem.
That is what the American people want us to do, and it is the right thing to do.
No vote in the United Nations will make any difference on that.”
This approach to sovereignty is exceedingly risky.
Most obviously, it repudiates international law.
In the case of Jerusalem, resolutions adopted by the General Assembly and the Security Council have repeatedly declared the final status of Jerusalem to be a matter of international law.
By brazenly proclaiming the right to override international law, the US threatens the edifice of international cooperation under the UN Charter.
Yet another grave danger is to the US itself.
When America stops listening to other countries, its vast military power and arrogance often lead to self-inflicted disasters.
America Firsters like Trump and Haley bristle when other countries oppose US foreign policy; but these other countries are usually giving good and frank advice that the US would be wise to heed.
The Security Council’s opposition to the US-led war in Iraq in 2003, for example, wasn’t intended to weaken America, but to protect it, Iraq, and indeed the world, from America’s rage and blindness to the facts.
“Bah!
Humbug!” said Scrooge.
But Charles Dickens’s point was precisely that Scrooge was the great loser from his arrogance, miserliness, and insolence.
How to Be a Misleader
LONDON – Under President Donald Trump, the United States seems to find itself confronting an extraordinarily ego-driven administration.
In fact, it’s worse: in his first month in office, Trump appears to be consolidating a type of governance by id.
The chaos now prevailing on the US political scene reflects this.
Policies are based on “alternative facts” and Trump’s own mythology as a straight-talking billionaire business mogul (though his back story is riddled with holes).
Ignorance of the law has become an excuse to flout it, and to engage in ethically dubious behavior, such as inviting Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to his Mar-a-Lago resort, or attacking the department store Nordstrom for dropping his daughter Ivanka’s clothing line.
(Trump re-tweeted his attack on the company from the official @POTUS account, and his adviser Kellyanne Conway then plugged Ivanka’s line on national television.)
Not surprisingly, businesses, which tend to be governed by superego, are actively preparing strategies for managing a presidential tweet barrage.
After all, Nordstrom wasn’t Trump’s first target (though it was the first whose shares actually closed higher that day).
In fact, many companies are being forced to make firm and public choices about where they stand in relation to Trump, his seemingly endless stream of controversial executive orders, and the politicians who ultimately back him.
This is nowhere near business as usual.
Ironically, this bizarre new operating environment partly reflects Trump’s own business background.
Trump is used to running his own company with a small team, selected based on his own criteria.
His successes and failures were his own.
He could choose what to withhold from the public, and he could sell whatever people would buy, caveat emptor.
His current job is a different story.
As much as Trump may like to claim that he alone can fix the US, the truth is that government is too complex an enterprise for one person to manage and direct.
Nor can he invent his own performance standards – especially if they prize personal loyalty over knowledge and experience.
And his failures are not his alone: the entire country – and much of the world – stands to suffer.
But there are some commonalities between running a business and running a country.
In both settings, leaders are expected to act in the best interests of the wider community, not simply their own constituencies, whether voters or shareholders.
Basic principles of good business governance – including transparency, integrity, reliability, trust, and legality – carry over to political leadership.
What Trump can’t ignore are checks on presidential power.
To be sure, the Republican-led Congress has (so far) been disinclined to fulfill its responsibility to constrain Trump.
The Senate rejected none of his cabinet picks, despite their lack of relevant experience and inadequate vetting (though two Republicans did vote against Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos).
The judicial branch, however, has resisted Trump’s bullying.
Trump’s executive order to ban people from seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the US has been rejected three times in court, and the White House now says that it will not appeal the case to the Supreme Court.
But the most vital check on power in a democracy is the people.
And, in the US, the people – peacefully but resolutely – seem to be finding their voice.
The day after Trump’s inauguration, women led what is estimated to be the largest single-day protest in US history.
Citizens have been contacting their legislators to demand better representation of their interests.
Utah Representative Jason Chaffetz, a Republican, recently faced thousands of his constituents chanting “Do your job!” at what was supposed to be an ordinary town hall meeting.
It’s not just elected officials who are being put on notice.
Not long ago, consumers, workers, and community members rose up in a global shareholder spring, aimed at companies that were acting in bad faith, by rewarding failing CEOs, flouting environmental regulations, or failing to respect workers’ rights.
We are now seeing a similar movement, with consumers turning against companies that support an administration embodying values they reject.
The #GrabYourWallet campaign may have contributed to declining sales of Ivanka Trump’s clothing line (the reason cited by Nordstrom and others for their decision to drop it).
The #DeleteUber movement punished the ride-sharing company for undermining a taxi strike at New York City’s Kennedy Airport in support of those caught up in Trump’s travel ban, and helped push the company’s CEO, Travis Kalanick, to resign from Trump’s economic advisory council.
When Under Armour’s CEO, Kevin Plank, expressed support for Trump, athletes associated with the brand declared their opposition, compelling the company to issue a statement distancing themselves from Plank’s comments.
Trump is a case study in how not to lead, either in business or in government.
With his jingoism and hair-trigger temper, Trump’s election seems to be wholly the result of many voters’ wishful thinking and stubborn passivity.
And perhaps that is the real lesson of Trump’s presidency so far.
The unthinkable can happen – as it did in the United Kingdom, with the Brexit vote, and as it may in France, if the far-right Marine Le Pen wins the presidency.
But what happens in a democracy is only what the people allow.
Trump’s UN Hypocrisy
DENVER – US President Donald Trump’s first address to the United Nations General Assembly will be remembered, above all, for its bizarre language, and its descriptions of North Korea as “depraved,” Iran as “murderous,” and Cuba and Venezuela as “corrupt.”
And, beyond calling out miscreant member states by name, Trump also offered a fervent defense of his “America First” agenda.
But while Trump’s particular choice of words was new to the UN, his arguments were not.
He pointed out, with some justification, that other countries also put their own national interests first.
And he reprised a longstanding complaint within US foreign-policymaking circles: that it is somehow excessive and unfair to expect American taxpayers to pay for 22% of the UN’s total budget.
After calling on the General Assembly to do its part to implement and then enforce sanctions against North Korea, Trump said, “Let’s see how they do.”
But referring to the UN as “they” implies that it is something apart from the US.
Trump’s tone was that of a dissatisfied tenant, blaming the landlord for his home’s poor state of repair.
But the UN is only as good as those who inhabit it, not least the US itself.
In his speech, Trump listed America’s many contributions to the world, and suggested that it keeps the UN around as a sort of favor to other countries in need of an international forum.
He assumed no US responsibility for the UN’s fortunes, failures, or even its achievements.
But, in addition to contributing more than any other country to the UN budget, the US also plays an outsize role within the institution.
The US can thus claim credit for many of the UN’s successes; but it is also responsible for many of its failures.
It is worth remembering that no UN secretary-general assumes office without US support.
And, as a permanent member of the UN Security Council, the US has veto power over any UN action, including sanctions, deployments of peacekeepers, and official condemnations of other member states.
Even if the UN’s large institutional bureaucracy can be unwieldy at times, its effectiveness ultimately depends on its most influential members.
Consider the Bosnian conflict in the early 1990s, when the Security Council decided to send in UN peacekeepers, rather than deploying a more robust multilateral presence, as would have been allowed under Chapter 7 of the UN Charter.
The United Kingdom and France, which contributed the bulk of the peacekeeping force, insisted on a peacekeeping mandate, because they did not want to put their troops in harm’s way.
The US, for its part, refused to contribute any troops at all, and thus had no right to call for a stronger mandate that would have allowed UN forces to step in to end the violence.
Although many Americans had witnessed the carnage from their living rooms and wanted the UN to do more to stop it, neither they nor their leaders – first George H.W. Bush and then Bill Clinton – had any interest in sending American troops to be a part of a Bosnian peacekeeping force.
The result, as we now know, was that the killing continued, sometimes in the presence of UN peacekeepers whose countries had not given them a strong enough mandate to intervene.
By the time the US-led Dayton Accords had put an end to the war, in December 1995, the UN’s peacekeeping capacity had been so thoroughly discredited that NATO war-fighting troops were sent in to take over from the UN Protection Force.
In other words, when the situation required war fighters, peacekeepers were dispatched; and when the situation called for peacekeepers, war fighters were sent.
None of this apparent dysfunction had anything to do with the UN. It was a direct result of UN member states’ decision-making.
Even Trump’s dystopian and dyspeptic speech conceded that the UN makes valuable contributions to world peace, through peacekeeping missions and other forms of assistance.
More often than not, this work is done in far-flung countries, where direct US involvement would be unpalatable to many American politicians’ constituents.
The UN is far from perfect.
But, rather than bash it, American leaders, starting with Trump, should understand that its actions and decisions are often an extension of their own.
Trump’s Reckless Tweets vs. Pakistan’s Democratic Hopes
LAHORE – Pakistan has now joined the ranks of countries hit by one of US President Donald Trump’s characteristic tweet storms.
In his first tweet of 2018, Trump declared that the United States has “foolishly” given Pakistan more than $33 billion in aid over the last 15 years, while Pakistan had returned only “lies and deceit” and given safe haven to the terrorists America hunts in Afghanistan.
“No more!”
Trump concluded.
And now the US is freezing its aid to the country.
Like his saber-rattling toward North Korea or his unilateral decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, Trump’s attacks on Pakistan may play well with his base.
But it will also have serious repercussions for Pakistan, where a number of shocks in the second half of 2017 have destabilized the country politically.
And if Pakistan stumbles, the consequences will be felt across South Asia and in other parts of the Muslim world, where a functioning political system in Pakistan could serve as a valuable model.
The roughly 50 Muslim-majority countries stretching from Bangladesh to Morocco have largely struggled to develop politically.
Under President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s leadership, Turkey, which once boasted a functioning democratic system, has been slipping toward authoritarian rule.
Bangladesh, too, seems to be turning into a one-party system, after having made notable headway, particularly on the economic front.
Now Pakistan – in a sense, the region’s best remaining hope – is also facing potentially disruptive setbacks.
Contrary to Trump’s accusations, Pakistan has made steady, albeit slow, progress over the last decade, both in combating terrorism and in consolidating democratic institutions.
That progress began in 2007, when a group of lawyers initiated a mass protest movement in response to an unconstitutional decision by Pervez Musharraf, Pakistan’s fourth military president, to suspend the chief justice of the Supreme Court.
The movement, backed by several political parties, ultimately forced Musharraf to step down in 2008, to avoid impeachment.
In the subsequent general election, the Pakistan Peoples Party won enough seats in the national assembly to form a solid government.
The PPP’s political rival, the Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz) won a majority of seats in the Punjab provincial assembly, giving it control of the country’s largest province.
Competitive politics had come to Pakistan.
After the PPP’s five-year term, the PML(N), led by Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, won the next general election, while maintaining its hold over Punjab.
The transfer of power occurred peacefully, with the PPP moving into opposition.
Pakistan had passed another milestone.
The still-powerful generals watched these developments from the barracks to which they had retreated.
After more than 60 years of changes in military leadership coming only after coups, the civilian-led government replaced the commander of the armed forces at the end of his term.
This was the third momentous achievement for the rule of law and democratic development in Pakistan, which now seemed to be in a strong position to continue strengthening its political system and institutions.
Its fairly well-developed political parties competed on a level playing field, elections were held when the constitution so required, and transfers of power occurred without violence.
Then, in 2016, the release of the Panama Papers exposed the extent of tax evasion by the world’s wealthy.
Members of the Sharif family, it was revealed, had illegally transferred huge amounts of money into numerous offshore companies, which had then invested in expensive properties in London and the Middle East.
These disclosures opened the way for Pakistan’s own “Arab Spring” moment, with young people rebelling against the elite-dominated political system.
Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf – a political party led by the former cricketer Imran Khan – provided just the platform for that rebellion.
Featuring a platform that includes a focus on justice and good governance, PTI had been gaining ground since the 2008 election, and received a new surge of support from urban youth demanding better services and less corruption.
That is no small cohort: some 75% of people in Pakistan’s large cities are below the age of 25.
Wielding its growing influence, the PTI threatened to call its young supporters into the streets if the Sharif family’s financial dealings were not properly investigated.
Given Pakistan’s history of military intervention in politics – in 1958, 1969, and 1977 – in response to popular protest, the PTI’s threat had to be viewed very seriously.
Pakistan avoided political escalation when the judiciary decided to investigate the Panama Papers’ revelations.
In July 2017, the Supreme Court announced its verdict: Sharif had acted improperly, and could not remain a member of the national assembly, let alone prime minister.
The PML(N) elected Shahid Khaqan Abbasi, a respected cabinet member, as Sharif’s successor as party leader and prime minister.
Military leaders expressed satisfaction at how the situation was handled.
At the same time, given the fragility of its democratic institutions and the lingering threat of terrorism, the destabilizing potential of Sharif’s removal should not be underestimated.
Trump’s insistence on playing to his nationalist and xenophobic (and, specifically, anti-Muslim) base, instead of advancing the real national security interests of the US, heightens the risk.
There is, however, some reason for hope.
Pakistan’s response to its recent political challenges indicates a continued commitment to fight for democracy – a commitment that could serve as a badly needed model for many other Muslim-majority countries.
Trump on the Warpath
NEW YORK – Fifteen years after George W. Bush declared that Iraq, Iran, and North Korea formed “an axis of evil,” Donald Trump, in his maiden address to the United Nations, denounced Iran and North Korea in similarly vitriolic terms.
Words have consequences, and Trump’s constitute a dire and immediate threat to global peace, just as Bush’s words did in 2002.
Back then, Bush was widely praised for his response to the terror attacks of September 11, 2001.
It’s easy to rally the public to war, and that was especially true after 9/11.
Yet, on every front – Afghanistan, Iraq, Iran, and North Korea – US militarism squandered global trust, lives, finances, and precious time.
And Trump’s approach is far more belligerent – and dangerous – than Bush’s.
For Trump, as for Bush, there is Good (America) and Evil (Afghanistan under the Taliban, Iran, North Korea, and Iraq under Saddam Hussein).
America the Good makes demands on the evildoers.
If the evildoers do not comply, America can exercise the “military option” or impose punitive sanctions to enforce “justice” as the United States defines it.
Bush applied the logic of force vis-à-vis Afghanistan and the “axis of evil,” with disastrous results.
The US quickly overthrew the Taliban regime in Afghanistan in 2002 but could not secure order.
Fifteen years on, the Taliban controls considerable territory, and Trump has just ordered an increase in troops.
America has spent roughly $800 billion in direct military outlays in Afghanistan, and indeed has been at war there almost non-stop since the CIA covertly intervened in 1979, helping to provoke the Soviet invasion of that country.
The response to Iraq was even worse.
The US invaded in 2003 on false pretenses (Saddam’s alleged but nonexistent weapons of mass destruction), squandered another $800 billion in direct military outlays, destabilized the country, caused hundreds of thousands of deaths, and, contrary to stated US objectives, plunged the region into turmoil.
The indirect costs of the two wars (including the long-term costs of veterans’ disabilities) roughly equal the direct costs.
Bush’s hardline approach toward Iran also produced none of the envisioned results.
Iran’s regional influence – particularly in Iraq, but also in Syria and Lebanon – is stronger today than 15 years ago.
Its ballistic missile development is much further advanced.
And the halt in its development of nuclear weapons is due entirely to President Barack Obama’s diplomacy, not Bush’s militarism and threats.
Bush’s approach vis-à-vis North Korea was similarly unsuccessful.
At the start of 2002, a fragile 1994 agreement between the US and North Korea was still restraining the North’s efforts to develop nuclear weapons, though the US had dragged its feet on several parts of the agreement.
Scorned by Bush administration hardliners, the agreement collapsed in mutual recrimination in 2002.
In January 2003, North Korea withdrew from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and resumed full-scale weapons-development efforts.
Now the country has thermonuclear bombs and ballistic missiles.
All four cases reflect the same US failing.
The US has repeatedly disdained negotiation as a sign of weakness and appeasement.
The hardline approach is initially popular with much of the US public, but invariably ends in grief.
Trump is doubling down.
He has all but declared his intention to abandon the nuclear agreement with Iran, signed not only by the US but also by the other four permanent Security Council members (China, France, Russia, and the United Kingdom) and Germany.
Abandoning the 2015 deal would parallel Bush’s abandonment of the nuclear agreement with North Korea.
Israel and Saudi Arabia recklessly encourage Trump’s Iran policy, but both countries stand to lose grievously if the deal falls apart.
In the case of North Korea, Trump’s approach is even more reckless, threatening that the US will “totally destroy” the country if it does not agree to abandon its nuclear program.
The probability that North Korea will accede to the US demand is close to zero.
The probability of provoking a nuclear war is high and rising.
Indeed, North Korea has asserted that the US has effectively declared war, though the White House has denied that interpretation.
Trump, like Bush, has turned President John F. Kennedy’s famous dictum on its head.
JFK told Americans that they should never negotiate out of fear, but never fear to negotiate.
Trump, like Bush, rejects negotiations, for fear of appearing weak, in favor of unilateral demands backed by the threat or reality of force.
With some vision, it would not be hard to see Iran and the US cooperating on many fronts, instead of facing off with threats of war.
Achieving the two-state solution in Israel and Palestine would also help to defuse Iran’s anti-Israel stance.
In the case of North Korea, the regime is seeking a nuclear arsenal to deter a US-led attempt at regime change.
Those fears are not completely misplaced.
The US has, after all, overthrown or at least tried to overthrow non-nuclear regimes that it opposes, including in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, and (unsuccessfully) Syria.
The North Korean regime has declared explicitly that it seeks “military equilibrium” with the US in order to avert a similar scenario.
The US suffers from an arrogance of military power disconnected from today’s geopolitical realities.
Militarism has failed time and again – and is more dangerous than ever.
Trump, a malignant narcissist, is seeking instant gratification and a political “win.”
America’s recent wars have provided such immediate gratification, before quickly giving way to grief – the ultimate quick high followed by a very deep low.
The US is on this path again, heading for a collision with a nuclear-armed adversary, and it will remain on it unless other countries, other American leaders, and public opinion block the way.
There is a better path: negotiations with Iran and North Korea over mutual security interests that are direct, transparent, objective, and free of US military threats.
The same is true regarding the conflicts in Syria, Libya, Israel-Palestine, Yemen, and elsewhere.
And there is a venue for this: the UN Security Council, created in 1945 to negotiate solutions when the world hovers between war and peace.
Donald Trump Meets Davos Man
MOSCOW – “If the mountain will not come to Muhammad,” so the saying goes, “then Muhammad must go to the mountain.”
With his decision to attend this year’s World Economic Forum meeting in Davos, Switzerland, US President Donald Trump seems to be taking that message to heart (though he would undoubtedly recoil from any link between the Prophet Muhammad and himself).
For the global business, financial, and political leaders who gather in Davos every January, the news that Trump would be joining them this year must have come as a shock, to say the least.
Much of the global elite, exemplified by the Davos crowd, feel deep contempt for Trump, and their disdain has likely been deepened by Trump’s recent racist rants about “shithole countries.”
Yet the conference will undoubtedly have its share of obsequious displays designed to appeal to Trump’s vanity, with participants by turns fawning over him and propping him up as he clumsily attempts to defend the indefensible, starting with his “America First” approach.
After all, this is the same crowd that kowtowed to Chinese President Xi Jinping last year, when he fraudulently positioned himself as the world’s new champion of globalization and the rules-based international order.
Some of the world leaders at Davos have strong incentive to suck up to Trump.
British Prime Minister Theresa May, in particular, may be eager to appease Trump, after the prospect of mass demonstrations kept him from attending the dedication ceremony for the new US embassy in London.
With Brexit looming – and losing support at home – Britain can’t afford any further deterioration of its “special relationship” with the United States.
May’s government is desperate to sustain the prospect, however deluded, that Trump will offer a good trade deal to the UK.
But, as much as Trump craves a good sycophant, this does not seem a compelling reason for him to attend the WEF meeting in Davos.
It is not as if there is any shortage of spineless bootlickers at home, both in Trump’s cabinet and in the Republican congressional leadership.
Earlier this month, Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas and Senator David Perdue of Georgia both attempted to defend Trump’s blatantly racist comments by claiming, first, that they did not recall hearing him say “shithole” and, later, that he must have said “shithouse” instead. (Could one base a defense on a more meaningless distinction?)
Not everyone at Davos is prepared to take that approach.
French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel will probably make themselves scarce when Trump is around.
Macron has so far handled Trump cleverly: he appeased Trump’s inner martinet by inviting him to the Bastille Day military parade last summer, but he has also challenged Trump publicly, with everything from a bravura handshake at their first meeting to a defense of the Iran nuclear deal.
As for Merkel, her taut and anguished meetings with Trump are almost as legendary as her frosty encounters with Trump’s apparent hero, Russian President Vladimir Putin.
There is no telling how African leaders at Davos – many of whom have publicly denounced Trump’s comments, demanding apologies and retractions – will react to the man in the flesh.
Likewise, it remains uncertain whether journalists will hold their tongues respectfully or give Trump the kind of shellacking that Peter Hoekstra, the new US ambassador to the Netherlands, has been getting from the Dutch press. (Hoekstra is being forced to answer for his 2015 lies that the “Islamic movement” had brought chaos to the country, that Dutch politicians were being burned by Islamists, and that Muslim-dominated “no-go zones” had emerged in the country.)
Given the risk that Trump will face derision and even outright mockery from some quarters, why he has decided to attend Davos remains unclear.
The only reason I can discern is that he plans to play to his domestic base, by putting his economic nationalism, xenophobic immigration policies, antipathy toward the press, and contempt for international institutions on full display.
If his comments are met with boos or silence, he will proudly tweet that it is because he – unlike his predecessor Barack Obama – is actually defending America’s interests.
Last week, Republican Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona condemned Trump for using Joseph Stalin’s infamous phrase “enemies of the people” to describe the free press.
Flake (who, like many other Republicans, will retire from Congress this year) was, of course, being too literal.
Coming from Stalin’s lips, the phrase, backed by the full and fearsome force of the Soviet state’s internal security apparatus, was a death sentence for millions.
When the same words are uttered by Trump, an object of suspicion for much of the US security apparatus, they become just another part of the narrative spectacle by which he channels the loyalties and antipathies of his supporters.
For Trump, going to Davos amounts to no more – or less – than taking the show on the road.
So, with apologies to Osip Mandelstam, I recommend to conference attendees an adaptation of “The Kremlin Mountaineer” (also known as “The Stalin Epigram”), the mocking poem that cost Mandelstam his life.
The White House Mountaineer
Our lives no longer feel ground under them.
At ten paces you can’t hear our words.
But whenever there’s a snatch of talk or tweet
it turns on the White House mountaineer.
the ten tiny fingers on his pudgy hands,
his words both cunning and weightless,
the huge snuggling fox covering his pate,
the orange glitter of his skin colorizer.
Ringed by a scum of chicken-necked advisers
he toys with the tributes of half-men.
One salutes, another meows, a third snivels.
He pokes out his little finger and he alone goes boom.
He spews incitements in a line like horseshoes,
One for the groin, one the forehead, temple, eye.
Trump’s Willing Accomplices
NEW YORK – On February 20, 1933, a secret meeting took place in Hermann Göring’s palatial residence in Berlin.
More than 20 of Germany’s top industrialists, including Gustav Krupp, Friedrich Flick, and Fritz von Opel, listened to a speech by Hitler, who promised them that their assets would be safe under his rule.
So they agreed to support the Nazi Party with over two million Reichsmark, an enormous sum that was almost enough to pay for the upcoming election campaign.
Few of these men, if any, were convinced Nazis.
They were members of the German Herrenklub (Gentlemen’s Club), which was very conservative but not National Socialist.
But, acting from narrow self-interest, they became Hitler’s enablers.
By doing so, they were accomplices in a criminal regime that was guilty of mass murder, and in the end the destruction of their country.
Their own companies benefited greatly from slave labor.
Thomas Mann called the Herrenklub the “trendsetter of misery.”
This didn’t prevent Flick and others from enjoying flourishing careers after the war, following light prison sentences.
US President Donald Trump is not a Nazi dictator (though some of his closest advisers admire some of the ideas that inspired fascism and Nazism in the past).
Yet he is a menace to the democracy he is supposed to protect.
He continues to attack the free press and judicial independence, and encourages mob violence, including by neo-Nazis.
Retweeting anti-Muslim videos posted by a British extremist is just the latest of his outrages.
Many leading Republican politicians who stand by Trump, and even the multi-billionaires who fund their campaigns, may have private misgivings about the dangerously erratic narcissist in the White House, just as the gentlemen of the Herrenklub probably once despised the vulgar upstart in his preposterous brown uniforms.
But with only a few exceptions, the politicians continue to support him – and for a similar reason: their narrow self-interest in staying in power and making more money for their backers.
A prime example is the tax legislation recently rammed through the Senate.
Once the bill is reconciled with the House version and Trump signs it into law, big business and the very rich will benefit at the expense of the poor and vulnerable.
And, according to the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office, America’s financial health will suffer as well, with an estimated $1.214 trillion added to the deficit by 2027.
This should be seen as a betrayal of many Trump voters in the rural areas of relatively poor states and the Rust Belt cities of the Midwest, where people most need the federal government’s help to remain solvent and healthy.
They are most likely to pay the price for enriching the very rich even further.
There are, of course, many differences between the US today and Germany in the 1930s.
Leftist thinkers have often claimed that fascism was the last stage of capitalism.
In fact, National Socialism and fascism were not especially friendly to liberal capitalism.
Nor were Nazism and fascism designed to benefit only an oligarchy.
Big business thrived under both systems, to be sure, especially corporations that profited from mining and military spending.
But, apart from persecuted minorities and dissidents, many ordinary people gained from government programs (not to mention the looting of conquered countries).
The industrialists who gathered around Hitler and Göring in 1933 were bought off by a murderous gangster regime.
The same was true of the German officer corps.
This was not the last stage of capitalism; Hitler used the capitalists for his nefarious ends.
The situation in the US under Donald Trump looks rather different.
Trump used populist language in his campaign, stoking up popular resentment against the educated urban elites, including capitalists on Wall Street.
And he continues to pander to the emotions of ill-educated white racists and others who feel left behind in the modern world, and blame their problems on liberals and unpopular ethnic and religious minorities.
But it is not yet clear who is using whom in Trump’s world.
In their obsession with low corporate and personal taxes, and their loathing of organized labor and the federal government, rich donors, such as the brothers Charles and David Koch, or the casino magnate Sheldon Adelson, appear to be manipulating Trump, rather than the other way around.
In a sense, they, as much as Krupp or Opel (if not more so), represent a type of capitalism that is being untethered from all necessary restraints.
This began long before Trump appeared on the scene.
The process goes back at least as far as Ronald Reagan’s era of “supply-side” tax cuts and deregulation.
In the short term, the wealthy and corporate America will probably do nicely.
Stock markets may well continue their bull run for a while longer.
But in the longer term, with deficits looming, international trade agreements torn up, and totally inadequate spending on vital infrastructure, education, and health care, things could turn out very badly.
Enabling a president who is clearly a danger to democracy for the sake of immediate financial gain is unpatriotic and morally reprehensible.
But it makes no economic sense, either.
Henry Ford was an anti-Semite who was happy to cooperate with Nazi Germany until 1942. He was also a leader of the America First Committee, which opposed going to war against Hitler.
But he had one insight, which Trump’s business-first accomplices would do well to heed.
“Fordism” meant that workers had to be rich enough to buy a car from his factories.
Trump’s tax bill will leave millions of potential consumers far worse off.
And that cannot be good for business.
Truthiness on the March
LONDON – The late US Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan famously said, “Everyone is entitled to his own opinion, but not to his own facts.” That may be true.
But, entitled or not, politicians and electorates are constructing their own alternate realities – with far-reaching consequences.
Nowadays, facts and truth are becoming increasingly difficult to uphold in politics (and in business and even sports).
They are being replaced with what the American comedian Stephen Colbert calls “truthiness”: the expression of gut feelings or opinions as valid statements of fact.
This year might be considered one of peak truthiness.
To make good decisions, voters need to assess reliable facts, from economic data to terrorism analysis, presented transparently and without bias.
But, today, talking heads on television would rather attack those with expertise in these areas.
And ambitious political figures – from the leaders of the Brexit campaign in the United Kingdom to US Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump – dismiss the facts altogether.
The environment is ripe for such behavior.
Voters, particularly in the advanced economies, are jaded by years of broken political promises, revelations of cover-ups, and relentless political and media spin.
Opaque or dubious dealings have cast doubt on the integrity of organizations and institutions on which we should be able to rely.
For example, the New York Times recently published a series of articles on think tanks that highlighted the conflict of interest faced by those who operate as analysts, but are beholden to corporate funders and sometimes also act as lobbyists.
As soon as a few experts are found to have been offering half-truths – or worse – the credibility of the entire field can be called into question.
Christine Todd Whitman, who was Head of the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on September 11, 2001, told residents of New York City that the air was safe to breathe and the water was safe to drink in the days after the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center.
But, as a 2003 EPA report noted, the agency “did not have sufficient data and analyses to make such a blanket statement” at that time.
With cases of severe respiratory illness piling up, Whitman now admits that the statement was wrong.
Likewise, as the recently published Chilcot report showed, the Iraq War was launched in 2003 under false pretenses.
Intelligence reports had not established that there were weapons of mass destruction in the country, yet British Prime Minister Tony Blair dutifully followed US President George W. Bush in ordering his military to invade.
The consequences of that decision are still emerging.
If our leaders can be so willfully wrong about such consequential matters, how can we believe anything they tell us?
This question has opened the door for a new, more overt truthiness, espoused by the likes of Trump, who seems to introduce freshly invented “facts” on a daily basis.
Trump’s surrogates, for their part, use television appearances and social media to restate the falsehoods, seemingly operating under the principle that if you repeat something often enough, it will become true.
And many voters seem willing to go along for the ride.
When 40 leading Republican foreign policymakers and national-security experts signed a letter expressing their opposition to Trump, whom they fear would be “the most reckless president in American history,” their concerns were largely disregarded.
Trump’s response – that those leaders are the ones who made the world “such a dangerous place” – sounds just plausible enough to justify ignoring their warning.
Even outright lies spoken in a nationally broadcast interview go unchallenged, as if Trump were indeed entitled to his own facts.
The leaders of the UK’s campaign to withdraw from the European Union enjoyed a similar advantage in the run-up to June’s Brexit referendum.
They painted a wholly false picture of the country’s circumstances – from its role in the EU to the impact of immigration – and knowingly made impossible promises about what would happen if the public voted “Leave.”
For example, leaders like Boris Johnson, now Britain’s foreign secretary, declared that the £350 million ($465 million) supposedly paid weekly to the EU (a deeply flawed figure that fails to take into account the benefits received) would be redirected to the National Health Services.
The Leave campaign even plastered the pledge onto the side of a campaign bus.
Now that the referendum is over, Johnson and others have backtracked, and the campaign has rebranded itself the “Change Britain” movement and promised to redirect EU funds to other areas instead.
This has infuriated many, especially given the recent warning by the body that represents hospitals across England that underfunding has pushed the NHS to the brink.
Brexiteers have also walked back pledges to curb immigration, amid a sharp increase in hate crimes across the UK that their rhetoric helped to fuel.
The downsides of Brexit should have been obvious to voters before the referendum – not least because so many economists, defense experts, and world leaders spelled them out during the campaign.
But, as leading Brexiteer Michael Gove proudly observed, people in the UK had “had enough of experts.”
In fact, it seems that some people voted for Brexit specifically because so many experts spoke out against it.
They seemed to believe Brexiteer MP Gisela Stuart: “the only expert that matters” is the voter.
It should be no surprise that the post-referendum reality is not what many Brexit voters expected.
Yet the revelations of the falsehoods that propelled the Leave campaign to victory have hardly driven people back into the arms of experts.
Truthiness is on the march, particularly across Europe and the US – in large part because so many of the authorities who should be calling out the lies are tainted by truthiness themselves.
Turkey’s Quagmire
TEL AVIV – As the Islamic State militant group has advanced across Iraq and Syria, traditional regional alliances, long shaped by Western powers, have been upended.
Particularly consequential is Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s struggle to reconcile his country’s relationship with NATO with its image as a leading protector of Sunni Islam.
The Turkish government’s reluctance to join the United States-led coalition against the Islamic State’s extremist Sunni fighters has isolated it from other Sunni Arab powers, such as Saudi Arabia, that have joined the coalition.
Moreover, it has further alienated Turkey’s Iranian allies, already estranged by Erdoğan’s obsession with toppling their man in Damascus, Bashar al-Assad.
And it appears to vindicate European Union countries, such as France and Germany, that never trusted Turkey’s capacity to reconcile its Islamist vocation with its European aspirations.
Indeed, a key NATO member state has become the paladin of radical Islam throughout the Middle East, led by a president whose core political constituency is ingrained with anti-Western sentiment.
Erdoğan’s supporters dismiss Western campaigns against Islamist terrorism as a ploy to repress Sunnis.
As one such supporter, Kenan Alpay, recently wrote, “Turkey cannot be a part of an international system that aims to dissolve all Islamic movements from the Muslim Brotherhood to…the Taliban in Afghanistan.”
A couple of weeks later, Erdoğan himself unleashed a furious anti-Western diatribe at Istanbul’s Marmara University. In his speech, he compared the West’s interference in the Middle East today with the British officer Lawrence of Arabia’s involvement in the Arab Revolt against the Ottomans during World War I, and blasted the Sykes-Picot Agreement, which has since defined the Middle East’s political map.
The similarities with the views of the Islamic State are glaring.
In a video produced after the battle for the Mosul Dam in August, the group called for the “end of Sykes-Picot,” and proclaimed the need to redraw the Western-imposed political map of the Middle East.
Erdoğan’s ambition to restore Turkey’s primacy in the Sunni world is driving him to collude with this challenge to the Western-devised regional order.
Indeed, Turkey has been offering logistical support to the Islamic State, even as it has enabled the group’s murderous members to massacre thousands of civilian Kurds and Yazidis in the Syrian town of Kobani on Turkey’s doorstep.
This highlights another issue on which Turkey and the Islamic State converge: the Kurds.
Erdoğan seems to hope that, by degrading Kurdish military strength and territorial control, the Islamic State will help him to achieve his central goal of diminishing the Kurdish nationalist movement, which has long been a thorn in Turkey’s side.
But, if anything, the war against the Islamic State has bolstered the Kurdish cause.
The Kurdish Peshmerga fighters in Iraq have already established a quasi-independent state along the border with Turkey.
And the Democratic Union Party – the Syrian affiliate of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), which has been fighting a guerrilla war against the Turkish state for the last three decades – is on its way toward establishing a Kurdish autonomous region along Turkey’s Syrian border.
Together, these groups have emerged as the most effective force in the war against the Islamic State.
And there is more bad news for Erdoğan.
The perception that his true objective in supporting the Islamic State is to stem the rise of the Kurds, bolstered by his apparent indifference to the agony in Kobani, has jeopardized one of his major legacies: peace talks with the PKK.
Erdoğan has even argued that, in Turkey’s view, the PKK and the Islamic State are the same – mirroring Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu’s statement that Hamas and the Islamic State were branches of the same tree.
With such desperate and unreasonable rhetoric, Erdoğan is lending credence to accusations that the entire “peace process” was simply a ploy to persuade the Kurdish members of Turkey’s parliament to support the constitutional changes that allowed him to move from Prime Minister to President.
That is an entirely plausible conclusion.
After all, Erdoğan’s anti-Kurdish sentiment also shaped his policy decisions concerning regime change in Syria.
He has long insisted on the creation of a no-fly “buffer” zone on the Syrian side of the border, under the pretext that it would help to address the humanitarian crisis that the civil war has engendered.
But his real objective is to forestall any Kurdish bid for autonomy in northern Syria.
(Turkey’s Western allies continue to oppose the proposal, lest they be dragged into an all-out confrontation with the Syrian regime and its Russian and Chinese allies.)
Erdoğan now finds himself in a strategic quagmire.
If his position on the Islamic State continues to waver, he will only alienate the Kurds further, which means that when the jihadists decide to encroach on Turkish territory, Turkey will have to confront them without a Kurdish alliance.
But if he decides to support the Kurds in their fight against the Islamic State, he will undoubtedly enhance their national aspirations.
But stronger Kurdish nationalism might not be such a bad thing for Erdoğan, who has been a vociferous advocate of the right of national self-determination beyond Turkey’s immediate vicinity, such as in the case of Palestine.
Indeed, such a move could be a welcome sign of political and moral consistency, possibly even boosting Erdoğan’s leverage in devising an arrangement with Turkey’s Kurds, including the PKK.
In any case, it is time for Erdoğan to make a choice.
He has already led Turkey into a thicket of clashes among its vital interests: its Western alliance, its regional aspirations, and the Kurdish question.
Something will have to give – and soon.
Turkey’s Baffling Coup
GRANADA – Military coups – successful or otherwise – follow a predictable pattern in Turkey.
Political groups – typically Islamists – deemed by soldiers to be antagonistic to Kemal Atatürk’s vision of a secular Turkey gain increasing power.
Tensions rise, often accompanied by violence on the streets.
Then the military steps in, exercising what the soldiers claim is their constitutional power to restore order and secular principles.
This time, it was very different.
Thanks to a series of sham trials targeting secularist officers, President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan had managed to reconfigure the military hierarchy and place his own people at the top.
While the country has been rocked by a series of terrorist attacks and faces a souring economy, there was no inkling of unrest in the military or opposition to Erdoğan.
On the contrary, Erdoğan’s recent reconciliation with Russia and Israel, together with his apparent desire to pull back from an active role in the Syrian civil war, must have been a relief to Turkey’s top brass.
No less baffling was the almost amateurish behavior of the putschists, who managed to capture the chief of the general staff but apparently made no meaningful attempt to detain Erdoğan or any senior politicians.
Major television channels were allowed to continue to operate for hours, and when soldiers showed up in the studios, their incompetence was almost comical.
Planes strafed civilians and attacked the parliament – very uncharacteristic behavior for the Turkish military outside areas of Kurdish insurgency.
Social media were full of pictures of hapless (and apparently clueless) soldiers being pulled out of tanks and disarmed (and sometimes much worse) by civilian crowds – scenes I never thought I would see in a country that has come to hate military coups but still loves its soldiers.
Erdoğan was quick to blame his former ally and current nemesis, the exiled preacher Fethullah Gülen, who leads a large Islamic movement from outside of Philadelphia.
There are obvious reasons for taking this with a grain of salt, but the claim is less outlandish than it may seem.
We know that there is a strong Gülenist presence in the military (without which the government’s earlier move against senior Turkish officers – the so-called Eregenekon and Sledgehammer cases – could not have been mounted).
In fact, the military was the last remaining Gülenist stronghold in Turkey, since Erdoğan had already purged the movement’s sympathizers in the police, judiciary, and media.
We also know that Erdoğan was preparing to make a major move against the Gülenists in the military.
A few officers had already been arrested for fabricating evidence in earlier trials, and it was rumored that a large-scale purge of Gülenist officers was in the works for next month’s meeting of the Supreme Military Council.
So the Gülenists had a motive, and the timing of the attempt supports their involvement.
It is a supreme irony that the coup Erdoğan long feared from the secularists may have eventually come from his one-time allies – who themselves were responsible for fabricating myriad coup plots against Erdoğan.
Yet a bloody military coup lies very much outside the traditional modus operandi of the Gülen movement, which tends to prefer behind-the-scenes machinations to armed action or explicit violence.
The coup may have been a desperate last-ditch effort, given the prospect that they were about to lose their last stronghold in Turkey.
But, with so many unanswered questions about what took place, the emergence of many strange twists and turns in the coming weeks would be no surprise.
There is less uncertainty about what is likely to happen next.
The coup attempt will add potency to Erdoğan’s venom and fuel a wider witch-hunt against the Gülen movement.
Thousands will be sacked from their positions in the military and elsewhere, detained, and prosecuted with little regard for the rule of law or the presumption of innocence.
There are already alarming calls to bring back the death penalty for putschists, which recent experience shows is a very broad category for Erdoğan.
Some of the mob violence against captured soldiers portends a Jacobinism that would jeopardize all remaining due-process protections in Turkey.
The coup attempt is bad news for the economy as well.
Erdoğan’s recent, somewhat skin-deep reconciliation with Russia and Israel was likely motivated by a desire to restore flows of foreign capital and tourists.
Such hopes are now unlikely to be realized.
The failed coup reveals that the country’s political divisions run deeper than even the most pessimistic observers believed.
This hardly makes for an attractive environment for investors or visitors.
But, politically, the failed coup is a boon for Erdoğan.
As he put it while it was still unclear if he was going to emerge on top, “this uprising is a gift from God to us because this will be a reason to cleanse our army.”
Now that the coup has failed, he will have the political tailwind to make the constitutional changes he has long sought to strengthen the presidency and concentrate power in his own hands.
The coup’s failure will thus bolster Erdoğan’s authoritarianism and do little good for Turkish democracy.
Had the coup succeeded, however, the blow to democratic prospects surely would have been more severe, with longer-term effects.
That provides at least some reason to cheer.
Narrative Power in Turkey
ISTANBUL – At the end of March, a retrial finally resulted in the acquittal of more than 200 Turkish military officers who had been convicted of plotting a coup in 2003 against the then-newly elected Islamist government.
The defendants had been given long prison sentences after the first trial concluded in September 2012, even though the evidence against them was clearly forged.
By the time the retrial ended, most observers recognized that the original proceedings had been a sham.
But, until recently, the “Sledgehammer” case – named after the fictitious coup plot – was widely viewed as heralding the long-overdue democratic subjugation of Turkey’s meddlesome military to its elected government.
Liberal intellectuals and Western observers applauded the prosecution and hailed it as one of the greatest achievements of the government of Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, who had since come to power.
Now that the case has been shown for what it was – a thuggish government’s attempt to weaken its rivals and consolidate its hold on power – the question is why so many well-intentioned observers got their analysis so terribly wrong.
My father-in-law was the alleged mastermind of the Sledgehammer plot, so my wife and I found ourselves moonlighting as forensic detectives and political activists.
In my five years investigating this bizarre saga, I learned to appreciate the power of narratives.
What proved most effective for the government was not brute force, but tales of nefarious activities by Turkey’s secular and military elites, which were contrasted to Erdoğan’s supposed commitment to establishing a democratic (albeit Islamist-tinged) state through a reconstituted judiciary.
Grotesque exaggerations based on half-truths, these tales gave Erdoğan and his allies the maneuvering room within which to make the political regime more, not less, authoritarian.
One ally in particular was crucial.
The Gülen movement – made up of the followers of the Pennsylvania-based Turkish imam Fethullah Gülen – did the heavy political lifting.
The Gülen movement oversaw Sledgehammer and similar trials via its followers in the police and the judiciary, and used its extensive media outlets to craft and disseminate the narrative – built from countless stories of military plots and other malfeasance – on which these cases rested.
Its representatives in the United States and Europe lobbied Western politicians and opinion leaders incessantly to vouch for Erdoğan’s democratic credentials.
At the same time, the Gülen movement invested heavily and shrewdly in cultivating Turkey’s Western-oriented intelligentsia.
Thus, despite Gülen’s own embarrassing history of anti-Semitic and anti-Western sermons, his followers managed to establish themselves by the 2000s as a civil-society movement that shared Turkish liberals’ values and aspirations.
Gülenists provided resources and networks to Turkey’s liberals, who then lent the movement legitimacy and credibility in the West.
When American and European politicians, reporters, and human rights specialists looked for insight on Turkey, they turned to the Gülenists’ liberal beneficiaries, who fed them the established narratives.
What made these intellectuals willing allies of Erdoğan and the Gülenists was their view that the military’s control of state institutions – “military tutelage” – posed the greatest obstacle to democracy in Turkey.
For Turkey’s liberals, the weakening of the military’s political influence became an end in itself.
It allowed them to overlook (or downplay) the growing list of rights violations and judicial manipulations.
And it allowed the Gülenists to play them – for example, by ensuring that damaging leaks from the military (the most egregious of which were fabricated) would be published in liberal outlets first.
The Erdoğan government adopted legislation that lent credence to its false narrative.
The European Commission looked with approval on a succession of initiatives – a new penal code adopting “modern European standards,” training programs on the European Convention of Human Rights, expert missions from the European Union, and constitutional amendments seemingly guaranteeing much greater judicial independence.
Unfortunately, as in development economics, mimicking advanced-country regulations and institutions rarely produces the desired results.
Form does not guarantee function.
But it can help obfuscate reality.
So it was with the Erdoğan government’s “pro-European” reforms, which served mainly to provide political cover for strengthening the Gülenists’ hold over the judiciary.
Fooled by appearances, the European Commission continued to assert, year after year, that the military show trials were an opportunity to strengthen the rule of law.
Until recently, the military was widely regarded as Turkish society’s most powerful and cohesive institution.
The generals had never been shy about intervening in politics when they felt it necessary.
But a well-honed narrative can be mightier than the sword.
The Sledgehammer case and other allegations, false as they were, immobilized the military.
Under intense attack by pro-government media, the general staff failed to mount even the slightest public effort on the accused officers’ behalf, even refusing to release an internal report that left no doubt that the defendants had been framed.
The top brass did not want to look like they were “aiding the putschists.”
Once the narrative was established, even its targets succumbed to it.
Western observers and the bulk of domestic liberals did not give up on Erdoğan until his government’s heavy-handed tactics during the Gezi Park protests in Istanbul in the summer of 2013.
He then broke clumsily with the Gülen movement after its acolytes in the judiciary launched a corruption probe against him and his inner circle.
Without his Gülenist allies, Erdoğan’s message has become oriented exclusively to a domestic audience, and features heavy doses of populist-religious-nationalist symbolism.
Meanwhile, the Gülenists, ever in search of the narrative upper hand, have been presenting themselves to Western audiences as Erdoğan’s victims rather than as his collaborators.
False narratives eventually become unsustainable (with the Internet and social media hastening their demise).
But, as in Turkey, a collapsed narrative can leave much debris.
And, rather than helping to clear the rubble, Erdoğan and the Gülenists appear determined to use it to build their own new edifices of lies, magnifying the challenge of future political reconciliation.
Erdoğan’s Pyrrhic Victory?
ISTANBUL – Turkish voters had a clear-cut choice when they cast ballots on Easter Sunday in a referendum on 18 constitutional amendments already approved by the National Assembly.
A “Yes” vote would change their country’s political system and usher in a new era in Turkish history.
More than a century of parliamentarianism would be replaced by an alla turca presidential system that is tailor-made for the current incumbent, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.
Given Turkey’s considerable experience in writing constitutions, most legal experts deem the amendments, which voters endorsed by a razor-thin margin, regressive at best.
Those who drafted them seem to have ignored 150 years of Turkish history, not to mention the most fundamental lessons of liberal democracy.
The political system that will be operational in 2019, after parliamentary and presidential elections that year, will abolish the post of prime minister and concentrate executive power in the hands of a president who also leads a political party.
The National Assembly – the Turkish Republic’s founding institution – will lose many of its powers, and its capacity to serve as a check on the president will be severely curtailed, because the president can dissolve it at any time.
Moreover, changes in how judges are appointed will give the president decisive power over the judiciary, too.
The judiciary’s already-fragile independence will be further weakened, and the separation of powers will become meaningless.
Despite the referendum’s high stakes – the abandonment of the Turkish Republic’s longstanding political framework – there was no serious or extended debate prior to the vote, which was held under the state of emergency imposed by Erdoğan in the wake of last July’s coup attempt.
And at the same time that Turkey undergoes far-reaching political change, Erdoğan will seek to advance a project of social transformation aimed at erasing a Westernizing legacy that dates back to the late-Ottoman era.
The amendments were approved after a relentless campaign of obfuscation, misrepresentation, and vilification.
Opponents were accused of associating with terrorists, and Western officials, particularly European Union leaders, were openly attacked.
But Erdoğan, who led the campaign, avoided any real discussion of what the constitutional-reform package would entail, instead merely promising that it would enhance Turkey’s greatness.
Erdoğan had almost the entire state apparatus – including provincial governors and much of the national and local bureaucracy – at his service during the campaign.
The government lavished all segments of Turkish society with economic incentives and state largesse, and the pro-government media was thoroughly mobilized to support the “Yes” campaign with absurdly sensational, one-sided coverage.
Most other media outlets chose, or were forced, to provide toothless coverage.
In addition to this state-led campaign, “No” campaigners were subjected to at least 200 documented attacks, some of them violent.
Members of the Kurdish-based Peoples’ Democratic Party (HDP) – including its two co-chairs, other party officials, and various local administrators – have been in jail since November.
On the day of the vote, a controversial decision by Turkey’s Supreme Electoral Council concerning the acceptability of ballots that lacked the official stamps on the back heightened worries about voting irregularities and cast a shadow on the legitimacy of the result – which is now being strongly, albeit futilely, contested.
All told, the campaign and vote fell far short of established international standards, as election monitors from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe have pointed out.
Still, Erdoğan’s narrow win could turn out to be a Pyrrhic victory, given how bitterly divided the country has become.
The no vote was concentrated in Turkey’s economic hubs, such as its western and southern coastal region, and the predominantly Kurdish southeast, as well as in its two largest cities, Istanbul and the capital, Ankara.
Of Turkey’s 20 most economically important cities, voters in 13, accounting for 62% of total national income, voted predominantly against the constitutional reforms.
And, because these cities represent the bulk of Turkey’s economic and cultural output, they are host to the country’s most educated segments.
By contrast, the yes camp comprised all but a few of Turkey’s least educated, economically insignificant, rural, insular, and conservative provinces.
This is not in keeping with the forward-looking agenda that has always brought Erdoğan political success in the past.
It is telling – symbolically and politically – that the amendments’ opponents carried Istanbul, where Erdoğan came to the national stage as mayor-elect in 1994.
Erdoğan was visibly shaken by the narrowness of the result – and the breakdown of support that underpinned it.
But, as the master of the political game in Ankara, he will try to shape the agenda, and remain on his current course, by relying on domestic polarization and, perhaps, daring foreign adventures.
He has given no indication that he will try to ameliorate the country’s tensions.
On the contrary, he has suggested that he will reintroduce the death penalty – a move that would bar Turkey from joining the EU.
The referendum’s outcome is almost certain to aggravate Turkey’s domestic and international challenges, which have been mounting since the July coup attempt.
The good news is that the strong showing by the amendments’ opponents, and their ability to mobilize through alternative media and micro-organizations, even while under duress, has shown that Turkish civil society remains vibrant.
But this is just the beginning.
Those who want to prevent Turkey from falling into the trap of electoral authoritarianism must now form a new political space and furnish leadership alternatives.
If they do not, Erdoğan will win the 2019 presidential election – and move quickly to use his newly expanded power in ways that will be far more difficult to combat.
Two Myths About Automation
BERKELEY – Robots, machine learning, and artificial intelligence promise to change fundamentally the nature of work.
Everyone knows this. Or at least they think they do.
Specifically, they think they know two things.
First, more jobs than ever are threatened. “Forrester Predicts that AI-enabled Automation will Eliminate 9% of US Jobs in 2018,” declares one headline.
“McKinsey: One-third of US workers could be jobless by 2030 due to automation,” seconds another.
Reports like these leave the impression that technological progress and job destruction are accelerating dramatically.
But there is no evidence of either trend.
In reality, total factor productivity, the best summary measure of the pace of technical change, has been stagnating since 2005 in the United States and across the advanced-country world.
Moreover, as the economist Timothy Taylor recently pointed out, the rate of change of the occupational structure, defined as the absolute value of jobs added in growing occupations and jobs lost in declining occupations, has been slowing, not accelerating, since the 1980s.
This is not to deny that the occupational structure is changing. But it calls into question the widely held view that the pace of change is quickening.
The second thing everyone thinks they know is that previously safe jobs are now at risk.
Once upon a time, it was possible to argue that robots would displace workers engaged in routine tasks, but not the highly skilled and educated – not the doctors, lawyers and, dare one say, professors. In particular, machines, it was said, are not capable of tasks in which empathy, compassion, intuition, interpersonal interaction, and communication are central.
Now, however, these distinctions are breaking down.
Amazon’s Alexa can communicate.
Crowd-sourcing, together with one’s digital history, can intuit buying habits.
Artificial intelligence can be used to read x-rays and diagnose medical conditions.
As a result, all jobs, even those of doctors, lawyers, and professors, are being transformed.
But transformed is not the same as threatened.
Machines, it is true, are already more efficient than legal associates at searching for precedents.
But an attorney attuned to the personality of her client still plays an indispensable role in advising someone contemplating a messy divorce whether to negotiate, mediate, or go to court.
Likewise, an attorney’s knowledge of the personalities of the principals in a civil suit or a criminal case can be combined with big data and analytics when the time comes for jury selection.
The job is changing, not disappearing.
These observations point to what is really happening in the labor market.
It’s not that nurses’ aides are being replaced by health-care robots; rather, what nurses’ aides do is being redefined.
And what they do will continue to be redefined as those robots’ capabilities evolve from getting patients out of bed to giving physical therapy sessions and providing emotional succor to the depressed and disabled.
At one level, this is good news for those concerned about the prospects of incumbent workers: there will continue to be demand for workers in existing occupations.
Not all nurses’ aides will have to become software engineers.
The knowledge they acquire on the job – of how one interacts with patients, how one recognizes their moods, and how one acknowledges their needs – will remain pertinent and valued.
They will use that knowledge to guide and cooperate with their robotic colleagues.
Thus, the coming technological transformation won’t entail occupational shifts on the scale of the Industrial Revolution, with its wholesale redistribution of labor between the agricultural and industrial sectors.
After all, the vast majority of Americans already work in the service sector.
But it will be more important than ever for people of all ages to update their skills and renew their training continuously, given how their occupations will continue to be reshaped by technology.
In countries like Germany, workers in a variety of sectors receive training as apprentices and then over the course of their working lives.
Companies invest and reinvest in their workers, because the latter can insist on it, possessing as they do a seat in the boardroom as a result of the 1951 Codetermination Law.
Employers’ associations join with strong trade unions to organize and run training schemes at the sectoral level.
The schemes are effective, in part, because the federal government sets standards for training programs and issues uniform curricula for trainees.
In the US, board membership for workers’ representatives, strong unions, and government regulation of private-sector training are not part of the prevailing institutional formula.
As a result firms treat their workers as disposable parts, rather than investing in them. And government does nothing about it.
So here’s an idea.
Instead of a “tax reform” that allows firms to expense their capital outlays immediately, why not give companies tax credits for the cost of providing lifelong learning to their employees?
A Better British Story
LONDON – Nowadays, there are hazards to looking for signs of hope in the British economy.
As the latest OECD forecast for 2018 and beyond shows, a cloud of gloom has descended on the United Kingdom.
The primary source of pessimism is, of course, Brexit, and the fear that withdrawing from the European Union will hurt British consumers through higher import prices and weak business investment.
And, making matters worse, the British government’s independent Office of Budget Responsibility has now lowered its expectations for economic growth, owing to persistently weak productivity performance in the UK.
Against this economic backdrop, British politics are in a state of chaos, with Prime Minister Theresa May seemingly presiding over an increasingly weak government.
At this point, the only thing stopping a Conservative Party putsch against May is the fear of losing a fresh election, which would bring a far-left government to power for the first time in many years.
Meanwhile, the rest of the world economy appears to be strengthening, and indicators that I consider to be reliable have been accelerating as we approach 2018.
One area that is particularly relevant to the UK is the eurozone, where the manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) rose above 60 in November – its highest level since 2000.
Despite the UK’s best attempts to declare economic independence, its fortunes will continue to depend more on its closest geographic neighbors than on any other country or region.
Elsewhere, almost all of the ten largest economies’ performance has been strengthening in recent months.
In the US, that was true even before Congress started writing corporate-tax-cut legislation, which now seems likely to be enacted.
So, where does this leave the UK?
It may come as a surprise to hear that the UK’s own PMI is now at its highest level in four years, suggesting that businesses are becoming more willing to make new investments.
If official data in the coming months support this finding, it will represent a significant positive development indeed.
Moreover, there are some early signs of improvement outside of London and the southeast, which is particularly relevant for some of the UK’s most deep-seated economic weaknesses.
As of October, monthly regional PMIs, which lag one month behind the national PMI, show a persistent positive trend that economic observers and policymakers will need to reckon with if it continues.
It has been a number of months since London was the UK’s top-performing region.
In October, that honor belonged to Wales.
And, just within England, parts of the so-called northern powerhouse have been outperforming London throughout 2017.
The northwest PMI is at its highest level in months, and indicates a stronger absolute performance than that of London.
Even more heartening, Yorkshire and the northeast are also showing signs of renewed strength.
Whether this newfound economic vigor will prove sustainable remains to be seen.
But, for now, it is a highly welcome development, and may indicate that policies aimed at boosting the northern economy have had some effect.
Moreover, PMIs are not the only evidence of improving conditions in the north.
Employment is increasing in some of these areas, notably the northwest.
And weaknesses in the London housing market do not appear to have spread elsewhere.
In fact, in the northwest, residential real-estate prices are showing signs of accelerating upward.
If this trend does endure, it would have far-reaching implications for the UK economy.
Strengthening housing markets in the north could do wonders to reverse the disturbing regional inequalities that have emerged in recent decades.
One thing we can be absolutely certain about is that the government should continue pursuing policies to engage with the northern powerhouse, and perhaps with the “Midlands engine,” too.
That means keeping its commitment to improve transportation infrastructure in the region.
At the same time, the government should be pursuing further initiatives to boost education and skills-training in the north, while also devolving more decision-making authority to regional and local governments.
Greater Manchester is at the geographic heart of the northern powerhouse, and its leaders have been spearheading the push for greater devolution of authority.
It cannot be a mere coincidence that the area is enjoying a stronger economy.
Britain needs more such efforts.
In 2018, there will continue to be plenty of drama surrounding Brexit and the future of the May government.
But, regardless of whether Britain manages to forge a productive new relationship with the EU, at least it has started to address longstanding challenges that have held too many regions back for too long.
Given that those problems are of the UK’s own making, policymakers, in this case, are right to look for solutions from within.
The Last Hurdle for Ukraine’s Recovery
KYIV – Ukraine’s capital abounds with signs of hope and anarchy.
The country has experienced an impressive economic turnaround, but corruption remains rife.
President Petro Poroshenko’s administration has stabilized public finances, but failed to rein in clientelism.
The question now is whether any judicial and legal reforms that Poroshenko undertakes can establish the conditions for strong, sustained economic growth.
Since concluding a loan agreement with the government in March 2015, the International Monetary Fund has followed through with four substantial disbursements.
But on a recent visit, IMF First Deputy Managing Director David Lipton warned that there are risks of Ukraine “going backwards.”
Ukraine’s problems are not macroeconomic.
The government’s current finance minister, Oleksandr Danyliuk, is an avowed free marketeer with a strong record of economic management, as was his predecessor, Natalie Jaresko.
According to the IMF, Ukraine’s public expenditures in 2014 totaled 53% of GDP, but had fallen to 40% of GDP by 2016.
And in just one year, from 2014 to 2015, Ukraine slashed its budget deficit from 10% of GDP to a mere 2%. It is now on track to maintain a deficit of around 3% of GDP in the coming years.
Moreover, thanks to improvements in the tax system, state revenues increased by 30% year on year in the first half of 2017, outpacing growth in expenditures. As a result, the government had a balanced budget in January-June.
In April, the IMF projected that Ukraine’s public debt would stand at 91% of GDP at the end of 2017; but the government has already brought its debt down to 81% of GDP.
This progress will likely continue as growth strengthens and Ukraine’s currency, the hryvnia, appreciates.
Ukraine owes much of its economic strength today to Valeriya Hontareva, the former chair of the central bank who cleaned up the banking sector over the past three years.
Under Hontareva, the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) shut down half of the country’s 180 banks, most of which were corrupt – if not outright criminal – operations.
And now that the restructuring is almost complete, lending is set to take off.
Typically, when a country gets its domestic finances in order, its external finances improve, too.
Ukraine’s foreign-exchange reserves have been a major cause of concern since 2014; but today, they stand at a reassuring $18 billion – equal to about 3.5 months of current imports.
Better still, the hryvnia has strengthened by 6% against the dollar this year.
This has boosted GDP and reduced the public debt, which is predominantly held in international currencies.
At the same time, Ukraine is undergoing a relatively fast “de-dollarization,” such that hryvnia-denominated bank deposits are now growing faster than those in foreign currencies.
Ukraine has the three essential ingredients for strong, sound growth.
In the first half of 2017, the European Union-Ukraine Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area took effect, and Ukraine’s exports skyrocketed by 25%, far outpacing import growth.
Moreover, Ukraine has strong investment and consumption growth.
In the first half of this year, construction surged by 24%, and retail sales increased by 8%.
But while the IMF has projected 2.9% GDP growth for 2017 – and annual growth of 4% by 2020 – annualized growth in the first half of this year was just 2.5%.
There are a few reasons why Ukraine’s newfound financial stability hasn’t yet led to a stronger growth takeoff.
For starters, the fighting in eastern Ukraine has disrupted the agricultural sector, the leading source of growth for the last decade.
But, more important, Ukraine’s “animal spirits” may be suppressed, because its entrepreneurs see little point in trying to compete with oligarchs who remain able to rig the economy in their favor.
Over the past three years, the government has started (with a shove from the IMF) to combat corruption in a systematic way, including by unifying energy prices and introducing a transparent electronic procurement system for most public purchases.
And so far, more than 100,000 public officials have publicly disclosed their incomes and assets in a display of transparency that rivals Scandinavian countries.
But the government’s failure to uphold the rule of law remains a serious problem.
Previously, domestic businesses and foreign investors worried that the tax authorities were abusing their power.
But in March, Ukraine’s anticorruption bureau arrested the country’s tax chief, Roman Nasirov.
Now, the biggest cause for concern is the Prosecutor General’s office and the security services. Both are under the president’s control, and both have come to be widely regarded as predatory state agencies.
It is hoped that judicial reforms currently in the works will check executive authority, secure property rights, and thus encourage growth.
But it is already clear that more will be needed.
In July, Poroshenko stripped the citizenship of Mikhail Saakashvili, the former President of Georgia whom Poroshenko invited to Ukraine and appointed governor of Odessa in 2015.
Poroshenko’s decision, carried out by decree and without due process, is legally dubious, and Saakashvili, rather than accepting his fate, has used his denationalization to galvanize Ukrainian civil society.
This month, he and the Ukrainian opposition leader Yuliya Tymoshenko entered Ukraine from Poland without going through passport control.
By inviting prosecution, Saakashvili has gained a platform from which he can criticize Ukraine’s justice system and Poroshenko’s neglect of the rule of law.
The IMF’s demand that the Ukrainian government establish an independent anticorruption court to investigate, prosecute, and punish dishonest public officials remains unfulfilled.
But if Ukraine is to continue on the road to recovery, it will have to demonstrate that no one – not even the president – is above the law.
An Inclusive Ukrainian Education
KYIV – Education is one of the few areas nowadays that is still considered a purely sovereign matter, an issue over which national governments – and, in many countries, even local authorities – should have control.
But, in today’s world, it seems that no issue is immune to political manipulation.
That is the case with Ukraine’s new framework law on education, which has become the target of harsh opposition not so much from within the country, but rather from some neighboring countries.
The law, adopted last month by Ukraine’s parliament, reflected a long and inclusive policymaking process.
Among its provisions is Article 7, which specifies that students in schools and universities should study in the national language.
Article 7 seems to be in accord with European norms.
Perhaps more important, it will benefit all Ukrainian citizens, including minority-language speakers, who will be better equipped to integrate fully into Ukrainian society.
Under the previous education system, some students would receive their entire 11 years of schooling (to be raised to 12 under the new law) in a minority language, mostly Russian, but sometimes Hungarian and Romanian.
About 400,000 students are currently on such a track, which has usually ended with students graduating high school lacking even a working knowledge of Ukrainian – the language in which the country conducts its business.
In fact, just this year, more than half of all graduates of Hungarian-language schools failed tests of Ukrainian.
Unable to attend a Ukrainian university, these students have little choice but to find local work in Hungarian that requires only a secondary-school education, or move to Hungary.
The education reform will change this.
From 2020, after a three-year transitional period, a minority language can be used as the main teaching language only in kindergarten and elementary school, from which point (after the fourth year of school) most instruction should be in Ukrainian.
Some schools for indigenous people, such as Crimean Tartars, will be allowed to keep the old system, but for the most part, graduates of Ukrainian high schools will, under the new system, be adept in the Ukrainian language.
This change will help to eliminate de facto segregation of minority-language speakers, thereby unifying Ukrainian society – critical to a strong and vibrant democracy.
It will also equip all students, including ethnic and linguistic minorities, not just to thrive in the labor market, but also to participate more fully in Ukrainian democracy, potentially securing government positions that enable them to advance further the interests of their fellow ethnic minorities.
It should also be noted that, while the rule will lead to less minority-language instruction, it does not preclude it.
Education in minority languages will be provided through separate classes and groups, with some programs allowing for instruction in multiple languages.
For example, if a Hungarian speaker were studying Hungarian literature, they would be able to do so in their native tongue.
All in all, the case for Ukraine’s new education law could not be stronger.
Yet neighboring countries are deliberately distorting the legislation’s significance, claiming that it is somehow a threat to ethnic minority groups. And they are prepared to punish Ukraine for it.
Hungarian Foreign Minister Péter Szijjártó has declared that, if the law is not changed, his country will block further Ukrainian integration into Europe.
“We can guarantee that all this will be painful for Ukraine in future,” he added.
Szijjarto, along with his counterparts from Romania, Bulgaria, and Greece, also voiced opposition to the Council of Europe and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.
Moreover, Romania’s president canceled a visit to Ukraine scheduled for this month, and withdrew an invitation for the speaker of Ukraine’s parliament to visit Bucharest.
And, perhaps most ominous, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov accused Ukraine of trying to “Ukrainize” the education system, in violation of the country’s constitution and international agreements.
Beyond being a gross misrepresentation, this approach is blatantly hypocritical, as the countries that are complaining about Ukraine’s new language rules have similar systems in place.
Though Hungary is home to some 8,000 Ukrainians, there is not a single Ukrainian-language school in the country.
The same is true for Russia, with its Ukrainian minority of over two million.
In Romania, with its roughly 50,000 Ukrainians, there is only one Ukrainian-language school.
The Ukrainian government has said that it will submit the law to the Council of Europe, allowing the Venice Commission to determine whether it meets CoE standards.
President Petro Poroshenko has promised to consider changing the law, depending on the Commission’s conclusions.
But, judging by Article 8 of the CoE’s European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages, which Ukraine has ratified, it seems reasonable to expect that changes won’t be needed.
That provision states that a system that guarantees sufficient minority-language learning in ordinary schools (in separate classes) is just as acceptable as one that ensures minority education through separate minority-language schools.
Moreover, the charter states that, in secondary education, it is sufficient to guarantee “the teaching of the relevant regional or minority languages” – not necessarily other subjects – “as an integral part of the curriculum.”
Regardless of the Venice Commission’s assessment, the response from Ukraine’s neighbors remains a serious problem, as it represents a flagrant effort to manipulate internal Ukrainian policy through intimidation.
Ukraine, which has been occupied for more than 300 years of its history, knows what it is like to have its language threatened.
Even its own government, under deposed President Viktor Yanukovych, attempted to undermine the Ukrainian language in 2012 with its Russia-encouraged “Russification” policy.
Ukrainian is the official language of Ukraine, just as Russian is the official language of the Russian Federation, Hungarian is the official language of Hungary, and Romanian is the official language of Romania.
While minority languages are important and the rights of their speakers must be respected – as Ukraine’s new education law does – it is the official language that unites a society and enables citizens to participate in it fully.
Ukraine’s government has the right – indeed, the duty – to ensure that all of its citizens are proficient in it.
Cheating Britain Out of Europe
LONDON – Several months ago, I predicted that British Prime Minister Theresa May’s government would fall by next month, when the British people realized that the “soft Brexit” they had been promised was impossible.
How wrong I was!
May has now called an early election, which she is tipped to win easily.
As it turns out, May herself realized what would happen if people discussed and disputed her Brexit plans.
So she crafted a political strategy that would keep the Brexit debate from opening up again.
This meant never allowing a popular (or even parliamentary) vote on what kind of Brexit May’s government should pursue, let alone a second vote on whether Brexit should happen at all.
But it was clearly stated that last June’s referendum on Britain’s European Union membership was merely consultative and not binding on parliament.
Moreover, the various Brexit options were never discussed as alternatives – much less voted upon – during the referendum campaign.
If anything, the expectation among Brexit voters, created by Brexiteers like Boris Johnson, now May’s foreign secretary, was that they could “have their cake and eat it.”
Britain, proclaimed Johnson and other prominent leaders of the “Leave” campaign, would retain easy access to the single market, while being able to block immigration from the EU.
Rather than revisit those issues and reveal just how mendacious the Brexiteers’ promises were, May has pursued a “lockdown” of all discussion.
And she has been breathtakingly successful.
The first step in May’s strategy was to state unequivocally last summer that “there will be no early general election.”
This served to prevent any mobilization of the 48% of the voters who had voted “Remain” and who, contrary to the expectations of most professional politicians, remain strongly opposed to Brexit.
Had May not taken that step, a political anti-Brexit project – led by, say, the Liberal Democrats or a new center-left party – could have emerged and challenged the Conservatives for power.
The result of a “Brexit election,” which took place once voters knew that Brexit really could happen, would have turned into a re-run of the referendum and could have been highly unpredictable.
But, until May’s announcement, seasoned political players, such as former Prime Minister Tony Blair, thought Brexit would be over before the next general election, so none laid the groundwork for such a project.
This puts them at a severe disadvantage.
The second step in May’s strategy was to avoid any discussion of what kind of Brexit the UK should choose.
Contrary to government claims, May’s goal here was not to gain the upper hand in negotiations, by keeping the EU27 in the dark about Britain’s objectives.
(Britain’s ideal outcome is no secret, after all.)
Instead, May’s government wanted to keep British voters from recognizing the extent to which they had been duped by the Leave campaign.
According to opinion polls, last year, most voters wanted both single-market membership and control over EU immigration.
If forced to choose, they preferred single-market membership by large majorities.
Yet May’s government is probably going to secure the opposite outcome: control over immigration, but at the cost of what she calls a “clean break” with the single market.
May’s government knew that, if the Leave campaign’s deception had been revealed, her Conservative Party, now tethered to Brexit, would have faced a potentially disastrous backlash.
This danger was highlighted last week by a YouGov poll, which for the first time showed a plurality regretting the result of the Brexit referendum.
So she is attempting to “boil the frog slowly,” ensuring that it doesn’t realize it is being cooked until it is too late to jump out of the pot.
This strategy was nearly thwarted, when government efforts failed to prevent a parliamentary vote on triggering Article 50, officially launching Brexit negotiations.
May’s government had resisted the vote precisely because it feared that it would have to provide more details about its aims, either repeating disingenuously the Brexiteers’ pledges, which the EU would quickly declare unacceptable, or owning up to the Brexiteers’ (and its own) deception.
When the Supreme Court ruled that parliament would get a vote, May’s government had to find a third way.
It resorted to the same obfuscation that had served the Brexiteers so well during the referendum – and won the vote.
The last critical step in May’s plan to push forward a version of Brexit that British voters never wanted is to prevent a vote on the final deal.
Were May to stick to the normal electoral schedule, negotiations would end just 18 months before the general election.
That is not the moment when a government wants its deceit to be exposed, especially given that the agreement May reaches may well divide her own party.
By holding the election now, May is avoiding this risk.
It is too late for the campaign to focus on whether to trigger Article 50.
And it is early enough that voters – and even many businesses – remain unaware of what a hard Brexit will mean.
In short, the British don’t yet know that they’ve been conned.
In the name of democracy and sovereignty, British voters are being denied any chance to reconsider Brexit, even though many voted for it under false pretenses, or to express an informed opinion on what kind of Brexit their government should pursue.
Instead, they are being manipulated into voting, yet again, for the impossible.
All of this carries worrisome implications for the state of Britain’s democracy, its political culture, and even its long-term stability.
When foreigners ask how British democracy can function without a written constitution, the usual answer is that Britons’ common understanding of fair and foul play would lead them to reject undemocratic behavior.
How convincing is that answer today?
China’s Volatile Growth
MILAN – Uncertainty about China’s economic prospects is roiling global markets – not least because so many questions are so difficult to answer.
In fact, China’s trajectory has become almost impossible to anticipate, owing to the confusing – if not conflicting – signals being sent by policymakers.
In the real economy, the export-driven tradable sector is contracting, owing to weak foreign demand.
Faced with slow growth in Europe and Japan, moderate growth in the United States, and serious challenges in developing countries (with the exception of India), the Chinese trade engine has lost much of its steam.
At the same time, however, rising domestic demand has kept China’s growth rate relatively high – a feat that has been achieved without a substantial increase in household indebtedness.
As private consumption has expanded, services have proliferated, generating employment for many.
This is clear evidence of a healthy economic rebalancing.
The situation in the corporate sector is mixed.
On one hand, highly innovative and dynamic private firms are driving growth.
Indeed, as a forthcoming book by George S. Yip and Bruce McKern documents, these innovations are occurring in a wide range of areas, from biotechnology to renewable energy.
The most visible progress has come in the information technology sector, thanks to firms like Alibaba, Tencent, Baidu, Lenovo, Huawei, and Xiaomi.
On the other hand, the corporate sector remains subject to serious vulnerabilities.
The rapid expansion of credit in 2009 led to huge over-investment and excess capacity in commodity sectors, basic industries like steel, and especially real estate.
The now-struggling pillars of China’s old economic-growth model bear considerable responsibility for the current growth slowdown.
Despite these challenges, the reality is that China’s transition to a more innovative, consumer-driven economy is well underway.
This suggests that the economy is experiencing a bumpy deceleration, not a meltdown, and that moderate growth can reasonably be expected in the medium term – that is, unless the financial system’s problems intensify.
As it stands, non-performing loans are on the rise, owing largely to the weaknesses in heavy industry and real estate.
While official sources report that NPLs account for 1.67% of loans held by commercial banks, the Chinese investment bank CICC estimates the figure to be closer to 8%.
If so, the banking sector – and the wider economy – could suffer considerably.
Whether it does depends on the decisiveness of the policy response.
As in the late 1990s, after the Asian financial crisis, China may need to rely on the large state balance sheet for loan consolidation, debt write-offs, and bank recapitalization.
But the concerns do not end there.
Net private capital outflows remain substantial, and show no signs of slowing.
As a result, the reserves held by the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) have declined by roughly $500 billion over the last year, with particularly large declines of some $100 billion in each of the last two months.
These outflows, together with volatility in the stock and currency markets, have left investors and policymakers increasingly worried.
Unfortunately, a clear explanation for this behavior has yet to emerge.
Some blame it on the combination of progress toward opening the capital market and an overvalued exchange rate, anticipating that net inflows will resume once the currency resets closer to market level.
Others suspect the influence of inside information: The capital exodus is a signal that economic conditions and growth prospects are much worse than official figures imply.
Still others cite the impact of President Xi Jinping’s intensive anti-corruption campaign and, more generally, declining official tolerance for heterodox views.
Those who feel directly threatened by the anti-graft campaign might be inclined to take their money out of China.
But many others may be doing so for fear that, far from giving the markets a more “decisive role” in the economy, the government may be moving to assert greater control.
Capital tends to flow to places where rules are clear and stable.
Given China’s systemic importance in the global economy, uncertainty about its plans and prospects is bound to send tremors through global capital markets.
That is why it is so important that the Chinese government increase the transparency of its decision-making, including by communicating its policy decisions more effectively.
Consider the soothing impact of PBOC Governor Zhou Xiaochuan’s recent statement (following a long and baffling official silence on exchange-rate policy) that the central bank would keep the renminbi “basically stable” against a basket of currencies and the dollar.
But the principal unaddressed problem affecting China’s financial system is the pervasiveness of state control and ownership, and the implicit guarantees that pervade asset markets.
This leads to misallocation of capital (with small and medium-size private enterprises struggling the most) and the mispricing of risk, while contributing to a lax credit culture.
The absence of credit discipline is particularly problematic when combined with highly accommodative monetary policy, because it can artificially keep zombie companies afloat.
To resolve this problem, China’s leaders must segregate the state balance sheet from the credit allocation system; but there is no clear roadmap for doing so.
Moreover, they should build on efforts taken to open up the capital account, thereby improving the efficiency of capital allocation over time, though this process is undoubtedly complicated by the capriciousness of cross-border capital flows.
China’s current bout of economic volatility is likely to persist, though increased transparency could do much to blunt it.
Add to that the smart use of state resources, together with sure-footed reforms, and China should be able to achieve moderate yet sustainable long-term growth.
The New Abnormal in Monetary Policy
NEW YORK – Financial markets are starting to get rattled by the winding down of unconventional monetary policies in many advanced economies.
Soon enough, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) and the Swiss National Bank (SNB) will be the only central banks still maintaining unconventional monetary policies for the long term.
The US Federal Reserve started phasing out its asset-purchase program (quantitative easing, or QE) in 2014, and began normalizing interest rates in late 2015.
And the European Central Bank is now pondering just how fast to taper its own QE policy in 2018, and when to start phasing out negative interest rates, too.
Similarly, the Bank of England (BoE) has finished its latest round of QE – which it launched after the Brexit referendum last June – and is considering hiking interest rates.
And the Bank of Canada (BOC) and the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) have both signaled that interest-rate hikes will be forthcoming.
Still, all of these central banks will have to reintroduce unconventional monetary policies if another recession or financial crisis occurs.
Consider the Fed, which is in a stronger position than any other central bank to depart from unconventional monetary policies.
Even if its normalization policy is successful in bringing interest rates back to an equilibrium level, that level will be no higher than 3%.
It is worth remembering that in the Fed’s previous two tightening cycles, the equilibrium rate was 6.5% and 5.25%, respectively.
When the global financial crisis and ensuing recession hit in 2007-2009, the Fed cut its policy rate from 5.25% to 0%.
When that still did not boost the economy, the Fed began to pursue unconventional monetary policies, by launching QE for the first time.
As the last few monetary-policy cycles have shown, even if the Fed can get the equilibrium rate back to 3% before the next recession hits, it still will not have enough room to maneuver effectively.
Interest-rate cuts will run into the zero lower bound before they can have a meaningful impact on the economy.
And when that happens, the Fed and other major central banks will be left with just four options, each with its own costs and benefits.
First, central banks could restore quantitative- or credit-easing policies, by purchasing long-term government bonds or private assets to increase liquidity and encourage lending.
But by vastly expanding central banks’ balance sheets, QE is hardly costless or risk-free.
Second, central banks could return to negative policy rates, as the ECB, BOJ, SNB, and some other central banks have done, in addition to quantitative and credit easing, in recent years.
But negative interest rates impose costs on savers and banks, which are then passed on to customers.
Third, central banks could change their target rate of inflation from 2% to, say, 4%.
The Fed and other central banks are informally exploring this option now, because it could increase the equilibrium interest rate to 5-6%, and reduce the risk of hitting the zero lower bound in another recession.
Yet this option is controversial for a few reasons.
Central banks are already struggling to achieve a 2% inflation rate.
To reach a target of 4% inflation, they might have to implement even more unconventional monetary policies over an even longer period of time.
Moreover, central banks should not assume that revising inflation expectations from 2% to 4% would go smoothly.
When inflation was allowed to drift from 2% to 4% in the 1970s, inflation expectations became unanchored altogether, and price growth far exceeded 4%.
The last option for central banks is to lower the inflation target from 2% to, say, 0%, as the Bank for International Settlements has advised.
A lower inflation target would alleviate the need for unconventional policies when rates are close to 0% and inflation is still below 2%.
But most central banks have their reasons for not pursuing such a strategy.
For starters, zero inflation and persistent periods of deflation – when the target is 0% and inflation is below target – may lead to debt deflation.
If the real (inflation-adjusted) value of nominal debts increases, more debtors could fall into bankruptcy.
Moreover, in small, open economies, a 0% target could strengthen the currency, and raise production and wage costs for domestic exporters and import-competing sectors.
Ultimately, when the next recession strikes, central banks in advanced economies will have no choice but to plumb the zero lower bound once again while they choose among four unappealing options.
The choices they make will depend on how they weigh the risks of bloating their balance sheets, imposing costs on banks and consumers, pursuing possibly unattainable inflation targets, and hurting debtors and producers at home.
In other words, central banks will have to confront the same policy dilemmas that attended the global financial crisis, including the “choice” of whether to pursue unconventional monetary policies.
Given that financial push is bound to come to economic shove once again, unconventional monetary policies, it would seem, are here to stay.
The Urgency of Refugee Education
GENEVA – The world’s refugee crisis is most often measured in numbers.
But for young refugees missing out on an education, the crisis can also be tracked by an irreversible metric: the passage of time.
Of the 17.2 million people that the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (the UN Refugee Agency) is responsible for protecting, roughly half are under the age of 18, meaning that an entire generation of young people, already robbed of their childhood, could lose out on a future as well.
School-age children form a large share of the world’s displaced population.
At the end of 2016, there were an estimated 11.6 million refugees experiencing “protracted displacement”: they have been away from their homes for more than five years and have no “immediate prospects” of return.
Of these, 4.1 million have been refugees for at least 20 years, longer than the amount of time the average person spends in school.
The case for refugee education is clear.
Childhood should be spent learning how to read, write, count, inquire, assess, debate, calculate, empathize, and set goals.
These skills are especially important for those who will be called upon to rebuild their countries when they return home.
Moreover, education provides refugee children a safe space amid the tumult of displacement.
And education can even help ensure the peaceful and sustainable development of the communities that have opened their doors to displaced families.
Unfortunately, for many of the 6.4 million school-age refugees currently under the mandate of the UN Refugee Agency, access to education remains a luxury.
Whereas 91% of children worldwide attend primary school, enrollment among refugee children is just 61%, and falls to 50% for in low-income countries, where more than a quarter of the world’s displaced people live.
As refugee children get older, the education gap widens.
Just 23% of refugee adolescents are enrolled in secondary school, compared to 84% globally.
In low-income countries, a mere 9% of refugee children are enrolled in secondary school.
As for post-secondary education – the crucible in which tomorrow’s leaders will be forged – the picture is dismal.
About a third of young people around the world pursue a college degree or advanced training; but, despite scholarships and other incentives, the percentage of refugees who do so is a mere 1%.
In September 2016, politicians, diplomats, officials, and activists from around the world gathered at the UN to chart a path forward for addressing the plight of the world’s refugees.
The result was the New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants, signed by 193 countries, which emphasized education as a critical element of the international response.
Furthermore, one of the UN’s 17 Sustainable Development Goals, which are aimed at ending poverty and promoting prosperity by 2030, is designed to deliver “inclusive and quality education for all and to promote lifelong learning” (SDG 4).
But, despite overwhelming support for the New York Declaration, and for the principles set out in SDG 4, young refugees remain in danger of being left behind.
The international community must now match its rhetoric with action.
Education must become an integral part of the emergency response to any refugee crisis.
Classroom learning should be given high priority, to help provide a protective and stable environment for the youngest refugees.
Because education not only imparts life skills, but also promotes resilience and self-reliance, and helps address the psychological and social needs of children impacted by conflict, it is a basic need for refugees.
Providing educational opportunities to displaced young people will require long-term planning and investment; it cannot be an afterthought.
Financing for refugee education must be sustainable, predictable, and holistic, both to enable education systems in refugee-hosting countries to plan accordingly, and to ensure that children’s schooling is not suspended when a new crisis erupts somewhere else.
It is also critical that refugee children are incorporated into the national education systems where they reside.
Refugees, like all young people around the world, deserve a quality education – one that follows an accredited curriculum, and is based on a rigorous system of evaluation and advancement.
Host countries are best suited to provide that.
Where the international community can help is by doing more to support educators, especially teachers, by ensuring suitable pay, adequate teaching materials, and access to expert assistance.
The education of refugees is a shared responsibility.
Last year, with the New York Declaration, governments around the world made a collective promise to invest in refugees and the communities hosting them.
As the UN General Assembly convenes for its annual meetings in New York this week, global leaders must recommit to that pledge.
Young refugees have no time to lose.
The Pakistan Conundrum
NEW YORK – Harold Brown, the US defense secretary under President Jimmy Carter, was reported to have described the arms race between the United States and the Soviet Union in these terms: “When we build, they build.
And when we don’t build, they build.”
From the US government’s perspective, the state of current relations with Pakistan is remarkably similar: When we support Pakistan, they do things we don’t like; and when we sanction Pakistan, they do things we don’t like.
From the Pakistani perspective, the past would be mostly a narrative of multiple betrayals, featuring a US that gets close to Pakistan for a time, only to cut off aid whenever its leaders see fit.
For example, the US armed the mujahedeen who fought the Soviets in neighboring Afghanistan in the 1980s, but then all but abandoned the region soon after the Soviet military exit in 1989.
Conveniently missing from this narrative is that it was Pakistan’s development of nuclear weapons in contravention of US law that necessitated the withdrawal of aid.
Much of that US aid was restored in subsequent years.
But mutual mistrust remained, in part because the father of Pakistan’s nuclear program (presumably with government knowledge) aided and abetted the nuclear programs of Libya, North Korea, and Iran.
The two countries grew closer again after 9/11, when George W. Bush’s administration delivered an ultimatum to the Pakistani government, telling it to choose between its relationship with the US and its relationship with the Taliban, which had opened up Afghan territory to al-Qaeda.
Pakistan promised that it would be a partner in the war against terror, and was rewarded in 2004 by being designated a “major non-NATO ally,” which qualified it to receive some of the most advanced military hardware and technology.
Now, however, another American president has come to be frustrated with Pakistan.
Rather than delivering the message in private in Washington or Islamabad, Donald Trump opted to go public: “The United States has foolishly given Pakistan more than 33 billion dollars in aid over the last 15 years, and they have given us nothing but lies & deceit, thinking of our leaders as fools.
They give safe haven to the terrorists we hunt in Afghanistan, with little help.
No more!”
If asked, which I was not, I would have recommended that such a message be delivered through diplomatic channels, because open, rhetorically charged criticism would make it even more difficult for Pakistan to change its policy course – presumably US officials’ goal – lest it appear to be a client state.
And I would have argued against cutting security ties and in favor of linking US support to specific Pakistani actions.
Indeed, the big US error after 9/11 was to treat Pakistan as if it were an ally.
With an ally, it is possible to assume a large degree of policy overlap. With Pakistan, no such assumption can be made.
Pakistan has the world’s fastest-growing nuclear arsenal, is home to some of the world’s most dangerous terrorists (including, for a time, Osama bin Laden), and, as Trump suggested, provides sanctuary to the Taliban, who are doing all they can to destabilize Afghanistan.
Pakistani policy is threatening not only a decade and a half of US effort in Afghanistan, but also the lives of the thousands of American soldiers still stationed there.
But even a more calculated, transactional relationship will not bring the US and Pakistan closer together.
Pakistan – a democracy in name only, owing to the political dominance of its military and intelligence services – wants an Afghanistan in which the Taliban play a dominant role.
The US, for many reasons, does not.
Moreover, in recent years the US has strengthened its ties with Pakistan’s archrival, India, with much economic and strategic momentum now carrying the relationship forward.
Pakistan’s natural partner is increasingly China, which is already investing heavily in Pakistani infrastructure and has become a major source of military equipment.
China, too, is wary of India, which will soon surpass it in population size and is emerging as an economic and strategic competitor – one with which it shares a disputed border.
The US should not, however, drop Pakistan.
Bad situations can always get worse.
Today, Pakistan is a weak state; tomorrow, it could become a failed one.
That would be a regional and global nightmare, given the presence of nuclear weapons and terrorists.
Economic and humanitarian support should thus continue to flow, though with close oversight of how it is used.
Some limited cooperation in countering terrorism and in Afghanistan might still be possible.
To reduce the chance of war, the US should also continue to work with both Indians and Pakistanis to strengthen their relationship (which is still far less developed than the US-Soviet relationship at the height of the Cold War).
It might also make sense for Pakistan to become a regular part of the US-China agenda.
The US and China are discussing various scenarios on the Korean Peninsula involving their troops, nuclear weapons, and local instability.
Talks on how to avoid a crisis involving Pakistan – and how to manage one should prevention fail – are no less urgent.
Life-and-Death Inequality
REYKJAVÍK – Just as some of us live longer than others, countries have different average life expectancies.
At the bottom of the scale is Swaziland, the only country in the world where a newborn still cannot expect to reach age 50.
And at the top is Hong Kong, where a newborn can expect to live to age 84.
In 1960, the world’s countries could be divided into two groups, based on mortality.
Countries in one group had low average life expectancy, from 28 years in Mali to just under 50 years in El Salvador.
And countries in the second, much less populous group enjoyed higher average life expectancy – up to 73 years in Norway, Iceland, the Netherlands, and Sweden.
Since then, Hong Kong has surpassed this North European group, as have Japan (84 years), Italy (83), Spain (83), and Switzerland (83).
Today, the people of Hong Kong can expect their children to live 17 years longer than in 1960.
Japanese newborns can expect to live 16 years longer; and newborn Icelanders can expect to live ten years longer.
Much of this increase in life expectancy around the world is a result of declining child mortality.
And the increase has been more marked for women, who tend to live an average of three years longer than men.
In Iceland, for example, the average life expectancy for men and women is 81 and 84, respectively.
But life expectancy can also vary significantly within countries, between rich and poor.
According to a new study by two MIT researchers, the wealthiest 1% of American men tend to live almost 15 years longer than the poorest 1%; and the wealthiest 1% of American women can expect to live ten years longer than their poorer counterparts.
Moreover, this gap widened over time.
In just the last 15 years, the average life expectancy of the wealthiest 5% of Americans has increased by two years for men, and three years for women.
Over the same period, the average life expectancy of the poorest 5% Americans has increased by just three months for men, and hardly at all for women.
Like recent reports about many Americans’ deteriorating health, this difference in life expectancy seems to reflect not just income and wealth inequality, but also unequal access to health care.
And yet US President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans seem intent on depriving 23 million more Americans of health insurance by repealing and replacing the 2010 Affordable Care Act (“Obamacare”).
If they succeed, life expectancy in the United States would most likely continue to decline, relative to other developed countries.
Between 1960 and today, for example, average life expectancy in the US increased from 70 to 79 years, whereas in Italy it increased from 69 to 83 years.
While the average American lived one year longer than the average Italian in 1960, the average Italian now lives four years longer than the average American.
Average US life expectancy has increased more slowly than in Europe partly because many white middle-aged Americans have, since 1999, been living shorter lives, owing to lifestyle-related diseases, opioid overdoses, and suicides.
In fact, since 1981, opioid overdoses alone have taken almost as many lives as HIV/AIDS.
It is extremely rare for any large cohort in a modern society to suffer such a decline in life expectancy.
The only other time it has happened in recent decades was in Russia after the collapse of communism, and in Africa after the outbreak of the HIV/AIDS epidemic.
Rising inequality, then, is not just a question of income, wealth, and power; it is, literally, a matter of life and death.
This may explain why inequality has shot to the top of the political agenda in the US and Europe in recent years.
In his 2016 Democratic primary campaign, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, a self-proclaimed socialist, condemned America’s rising inequality and actually came closer to being elected president than many had expected.
And Trump – like the “Leave” campaign in the United Kingdom – was embraced by many voters who feel left behind.
Despite being founded in 1945, the International Monetary Fund only recently began to pay ample attention to the distribution of income and wealth in its member countries.
Having now realized that inequality can hinder economic growth, the IMF has begun to discuss the inequality-growth relationship with several of its members.
Some observers have disparaged the IMF for this new approach, and argue that increased inequality simply reflects what people have voted for.
But those who claim that inequality is something to be desired are akin to those who argue that unemployment is always voluntary, as some economists still insist.
In fact, when inequality rises, democracy suffers, which is why the demotion of the US in one prominent ranking of the world’s democracies is not particularly surprising.
Most people do not want to be unemployed, or be left behind, or have his or her life cut short.
It only looks that way to those who frame the choices voters make.
The International Consequences of US Tax Reform
CAMBRIDGE – The United States Congress is likely to enact a major tax reform sometime during the next six months.
Although the new rules will apply only to American taxpayers, they will have important consequences for companies and markets around the world.
The most important changes will apply to US corporations rather than to individual taxpayers.
Of these reforms, the one with the most obvious and direct international impact will be the change in the taxation of US corporations’ foreign subsidiaries.
The current US rule is unique among all major advanced economies. Consider the example of a subsidiary of a US corporation that earns profits in Ireland.
That subsidiary pays the Irish corporate tax at Ireland’s low 12% rate. It is then free to reinvest the after-tax profits in Ireland, in financial securities, or in operating businesses anywhere in the world – except the US.
If the foreign subsidiary’s parent company brings the after-tax profits back to the US to invest or distribute to its shareholders, it must pay the current US corporate tax rate of 35% on its original pre-tax Irish profits, with a credit for the 12% that it has already paid.
Because of this 23% penalty on repatriation, US companies generally choose not to repatriate the profits of their foreign subsidiaries.
The Treasury Department estimates that these subsidiaries have accumulated $2.5 trillion of offshore profits.
Congress is now likely to adopt the “territorial” method of taxing the profits of US corporations’ foreign subsidiaries.
Under the territorial method, which virtually every other advanced economy uses, US corporations will be able to repatriate their foreign subsidiaries’ after-tax profits with little or no extra tax.
Congress is also likely to enact a “deemed repatriation tax” on the $2.5 trillion of profits that have been accumulated abroad but never subject to US tax.
Although the details of this provision have not been decided, the basic idea would be to levy a tax of about 10% on the untaxed overseas profits, to be paid over a period of years.
In exchange for this new tax liability, a US corporation could repatriate those accumulated profits whenever it wanted to do so.
The shift to a territorial tax system is likely to have important effects on US corporations’ behavior.
A large share of their foreign subsidiaries’ future profits, which would be retained abroad under current law, are likely to be returned to the US, reducing investment in Europe and Asia.
A portion of the $2.5 trillion of past profits now held abroad would be repatriated as well.
Moreover, US corporations will no longer have an incentive to shift their country of incorporation to other countries in order to be able to distribute their foreign-earned profits to their shareholders.
At the same time, foreign companies will have an incentive to shift their headquarters to the US, where they could enjoy the advantages of being a US corporation without incurring the current tax penalty.
Although the shift to a territorial system of taxation would have the most obvious foreign impact, the planned reduction in the corporate tax rate may have an even larger effect.
The 35% statutory tax rate on corporate profits is one of the highest among all developed countries. The congressional proposal would reduce the corporate rate to 20%.
A lower corporate tax rate and the shift to a territorial system would increase the flow of capital to investment in US corporations from abroad and from capital investments in owner-occupied housing and in agriculture.
This would raise productivity and GDP, leading to increases in tax revenue that would partly offset the direct effect of the corporate rate reduction.
But, because corporate tax revenue is now about 1.6% of GDP, the direct effect of halving the tax rate would reduce revenue by about 0.8% of GDP, or $160 billion a year at the current level of output.
The US cannot afford such a large increase in the fiscal deficit.
And, because few features of the corporate tax law can be changed to reduce that revenue loss, I think the corporate tax rate will be reduced to about 25%. That would still be substantially less than the current rate and in line with the OECD average.
Corporate tax rates have been declining around the world in recent decades.
The US rate was previously 50%, and rates in the other OECD countries were substantially higher than the current 25% average.
It is certainly possible that the reduction of the US rate will cause other developed countries to reduce their corporate tax rates to improve their relative attractiveness to internationally mobile capital.
In short, the congressional legislation that is likely in the months ahead will change the tax rules for US companies, but it will also have important effects on international capital flows. It could also have significant effects on tax rules around the world.
What Happens When Primary Health Care Is Universal?
BOSTON – Two years after the death of her husband, Valeria, a 67-year-old grandmother in San José, Costa Rica, lives alone.
Last year, she was diagnosed with high blood pressure and diabetes, conditions that, while not immediately life threatening, require health care to manage.
But, thanks to the quality of Costa Rica’s primary health-care system, Valeria has been able to maintain her independence and her health, even in the absence of family.
Costa Rica, a middle-income country that is committed to universal health care for its people, produces better health outcomes, while spending less than most other countries in the world.
In fact, Costa Rica has achieved the third-highest life expectancy in the Americas – behind only Canada and Bermuda, and well ahead of the United States.
The secret of its success is revealed in our new report, “Building a Thriving Primary Health-Care System: The Story of Costa Rica.”
After her diabetes diagnosis, Valeria was automatically entered into the diabetes chronic-care program at her assigned clinic, a ten-minute walk from her house.
She visits with her primary-care team every three months to have her blood pressure checked, and to make sure her diabetes is under control.
And, once a year, a community health worker visits her home to ensure that it is safe, to administer vaccinations, and to share information about maintaining a healthy lifestyle.
As the global health community works to implement the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, including SDG 3 – which targets achievement of wellbeing for all by 2030 – Costa Rica offers a model to consider emulating.
Around the world, chronic diseases are increasing and populations are aging, making universal access to affordable care a top priority.
Unfortunately, many patients will suffer far worse health outcomes than Valeria, simply because they are unable to access quality primary health-care services.
Well-organized primary health systems – which emphasize promotive, preventive, and chronic care, with general practitioners serving as the first point of contact – increase quality and reduce service fragmentation.
Studies show that areas with more primary-care physicians have lower mortality and better health outcomes than those with fewer primary-care physicians.
Primary health care is also a key pathway to achieving universal health coverage, a stated goal of the international community.
Over the past 20 years, Costa Rica’s Department of Social Security has built a primary health-care system that today reaches nearly every person in the country.
Primary providers are the first place Costa Ricans turn when they have a health problem, as practitioners offer acute, chronic, and preventive services.
A similar system has been used successfully in other countries, such as New Zealand, and allows patients and their families to build long-term relationships with providers.
Costa Rica’s approach began with reforms in the 1990s, when the country committed to a few simple changes designed to upgrade its health-care services.
Some of these could be emulated by countries today.
For starters, officials in San José merged multiple health-care agencies into one, giving the new body authority over financing decisions and service delivery – everything from vaccinations to complex surgeries.
While a consolidated approach might not work for every country, many could benefit from a more integrated bureaucratic approach.
Second, Costa Rica divided the country into 104 coverage areas, assigning every citizen a primary health-care team.
This helped providers track health trends more precisely, and allowed for proactive and cost-effective health management.
Third, the authorities created multidisciplinary primary health-care teams capable of delivering preventive care services, such as vaccinations and education, in conjunction with acute and chronic medical support.
This holistic approach draws on the combined expertise of physicians, nurses, community health workers, pharmacists, and data clerks.
Finally, the health department created a system to gauge statistically the quality of the care it was delivering.
The data are currently used for ongoing monitoring to improve health-care provision in real time.
These four enhancements have had a dramatic effect on the system.
Access to primary health care has surged, from 25% of the population in the early 1990s to 93% in 2006.
Today, more than 94% of the population is assigned to a specific primary health-care team.
Quality has also increased and, thanks to efficiency gains, the costs are a fraction of what other countries pay.
As countries pursue universal health coverage, they will need proven ways to bring higher quality, more affordable care to the underserved.
Costa Rica offers one successful approach.
By placing primary health care at the center of the system, the country has improved coverage rates and outcomes, while delivering more personalized treatment.
For patients like Valeria, this has meant a system that is accessible, easy to use, and caring in an ongoing basis.
Costa Rica’s reforms have greatly improved her quality of life, and no doubt there are many other patients just like her, in every corner of the world, who could benefit from a similar approach.
The Fight for Ocean Health
NEW YORK – The ocean is changing – and not for the better.
Well-established scientific evidence shows that it is becoming emptier, warmer, and more acidic, putting marine life under serious pressure.
But there is good news: evidence also indicates that the ocean can regenerate, and the world has already agreed to enable that outcome.
The Sustainable Development Goal for the Ocean (SDG 14) was adopted by world leaders in September 2015 as part of the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
It includes vital targets, such as mitigating ocean acidification, securing habitat and species protections, reducing pollution substantially, and ending illegal fishing and subsidies that lead to overfishing.
Ultimately, SDG 14 promises to preserve the ocean and ensure its sustainable use in the future.
But it can be realized only with bold and urgent action, buttressed by solidarity among governments, citizens, and business.
This week, governments and experts are gathering in New York to begin crafting a global “call for action” to implement SDG 14.
The call, which will be launched in June, at the UN’s first-ever Ocean Conference, should include a firm commitment to protect at least 30% of the ocean by 2030, and ensure that the remaining 70% is sustainably managed.
UN member states must also pledge to secure the extension of legal protections to high-seas biodiversity by closing the gaping governance loophole that exposes the ocean to plunder.
There is one more priority area that the call for action must address: climate change.
In fact, a healthy ocean will be impossible to secure without also addressing this pressing global challenge.
Achieving SDG 14 therefore demands that the international community reaffirm its commitment to the Paris climate agreement, and to announce concrete steps toward achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.
To avoid more empty promises, all commitments must be backed up by a clear financing plan and subjected to regular accountability checks.
Governments, the UN, and other actors should set a schedule for monitoring and check-ins, to keep delivery of the targets transparent, funded, and on schedule.
To support these efforts, we urge UN Secretary-General António Guterres to appoint a Special Representative for the Ocean, tasked with improving ocean governance and ensuring that the full potential of SDG 14 is realized.
Such a representative must be given sufficient resources to do the job.
The ocean has suffered decades of abuse and neglect.
It has been treated as a free-for-all garbage bin and race-to-the-bottom buffet.
We have financed its destruction, with no regard for the consequences.
But those consequences have become impossible to ignore.
While we, as previous global ocean commissioners, had to campaign hard in 2014 for the ocean to have its own dedicated global goal, it is now hard to believe that the ocean’s position in the SDGs was ever in question.
That is the sense that we should have in 2030, when the targets of SDG 14 are fully met.
The only way to get there is through concerted effort – and not just by the likes of ocean commissioners.
People everywhere must stand up and demand real action to ensure the ocean’s regeneration.
In short, the ocean must become everyone’s business.
To kick-start that process, we have joined the Ocean Unite network, which is galvanizing conservationists, business leaders, young people, and activists to take advantage of growing interest in these issues and create coalitions that can drive ocean health to the top of political and economic agendas worldwide.
Such efforts are already having an impact, with citizens mobilizing to defend the ocean and policymakers beginning to respond to their calls.
Now, it is the business community’s turn to step up.
Business has a clear interest in reversing the decline in ocean health.
The GDP derived from the ocean amounts to $2.5 trillion, or 5% of the world’s total GDP.
That’s equivalent to the GDP of the world’s seventh-largest economy.
The ocean is also the world’s biggest employer, directly supporting the livelihoods of more than three billion people, and is a source of food for over 2.6 billion.
Restoring the ocean thus amounts to an unparalleled business opportunity.
But the ocean’s value goes far beyond economics.
It provides half of the air we breathe, governs our weather, and helps to support peace and prosperity.
The ocean’s future is the world’s future.
At a time when politics threatens to undermine cooperative action on the environment, fighting for our shared global environment is more important than ever.
Our responsibility for the ocean’s health is as deep, fundamental, and permanent as our dependence on it.
No political consideration can compete with that.
Now is the time for all of us – citizens, business, and government – to unite and fight for our ocean.
The Old New Financial Risk
WASHINGTON, DC – The main financial risk facing the United States today looks very similar to what caused so much trouble in 2007-2008: big banks with too much debt and too little equity capital on their balance sheets.
Uneven global regulations, not to mention regulators who fall asleep at the wheel, compound this structural vulnerability.
We already saw this movie, and it ended badly.
Next time could be an even worse horror show.
All booms are different, but every major financial crisis has at its heart the same issue: major banks get into trouble and teeter on the brink of collapse.
Disruption at the core of any banking system leads to tight credit, with major negative effects on the real economy.
In our modern world, in which finance is interwoven throughout the economy, the consequences can be particularly severe – as we saw in 2008 and 2009.
The most important question to ask of any financial system is how much loss-absorbing equity major banks have on their balance sheets.
When a company suffers losses, its shareholder equity falls in value, and less equity means that the company is more likely to default on its debts.
The capital ratios most frequently highlighted by banks and officials are misleading, because they include items – such as goodwill and deferred tax assets – that are incapable of absorbing losses.
We need to look instead at tangible equity relative to tangible assets.
And we should also be very careful about the accounting used for derivatives.
On this technical but crucial point, US generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) are considerably more generous (because they understate potential losses) than International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).
Thomas Hoenig, vice chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, publishes his own calculation of capital levels at the world’s largest banks, and these data are now available through the end of 2014.
The most leveraged big US bank, Morgan Stanley, has less than 4% equity, meaning that 96% of its balance sheet is some form of debt.
The average for big US banks is just under 5% equity.
This is more – but not much more – capital than some troubled banks had in the run-up to the financial crisis in 2008.
Citigroup, for example, had no more than 4.3% equity, according to Hoenig’s calculation, in November 2008.
At the end of 2012, when Hoenig started to publish his US GAAP-IFRS adjustment, the average for the largest US banks was roughly 4% equity.
It is possible to argue that this key measure is moving in the right direction, but the pace of improvement is glacial at best.
More important, 5% equity is unlikely to be enough to absorb the kinds of losses that a highly volatile world will throw up.
Some major shocks could come from unexpected quarters.
For example, assets may prove less liquid than investors suppose, as happened with money market funds in 2008; today, skeptics worry about exchange-traded funds (ETFs).
Or overly complex securities could become hard to price.
It is a red flag when people selling collateralized loan obligations today cannot fully explain the risks involved.
Or perhaps the shock will affect sovereign-debt values in faraway places, as happened in 1982.
It is striking that no experts – public or private – really have a firm grip on what could happen if there is another round of difficulties with Greek government debt.
But the most dangerous shocks may be those that originate with the big banks themselves.
The latest significant development to surface is what Better Markets, a pro-reform group that has put out a helpful fact sheet, calls “de facto guaranteed foreign subsidiaries” that trade derivatives – a murky phenomenon that likely involves all the big players.
The trick here is that a de jure guaranteed foreign subsidiary of a US bank would have to comply with many US rules, including those governing conduct, transparency, and clearing (how the derivatives are actually traded).
A foreign subsidiary that is supposedly independent is exempt from those rules.
But, as Dennis Kelleher of Better Markets points out, when pressure mounts and a crisis seems around the corner, banks will face great pressure to bring such subsidiaries back onto their balance sheet.
This is exactly what happened in the last crisis, with Citigroup being a leading example.
The main reason why such loopholes are left open is that regulators choose not to close them.
Sometimes this may be due to lack of information or awareness.
But, in many cases, the regulators actually believe that there is nothing wrong with the behavior in question – either because they have been persuaded by lobbyists or because they themselves used to work in the industry (or could go work there soon.)
Sound familiar?
A Belt and Road for the Americas?
WASHINGTON, DC – As Canada, Mexico, and the United States focus on the next round of negotiations on modernizing the North American Free Trade Agreement – a highly uncertain endeavor – governments in the rest of the Americas are grappling with a more fundamental question about trade.
Who will be their dominant trade partner in the future: the US, Europe, or China?
For more than a century, the resounding answer to that question has been, “the US.”
The country’s proximity, soft power, and sheer economic might made it the natural center of commercial attention for Latin America.
And Latin America is the first or second most important trading partner for 37 of the 50 US states.
In 2016, US companies exported a total of $515 billion worth of goods and services to Latin America and the Caribbean – nearly three times as much as they exported to China.
Moreover, whereas the US has a large and recurring trade deficit with China, the country typically posts a surplus with its southern neighbors, which traditionally favor the high-value goods and sophisticated services that US companies provide.
Yet this picture is changing fast.
Over the last two decades, Chinese companies have been quietly gaining market share in Latin America and the Caribbean.
The share of US imports in Latin America dropped from 50% in 2000 to 33% in 2016, while China’s share jumped from 3% to 18%.
In many Latin American homes, Chinese-made laptops, smartphones, televisions, and automobiles have replaced legendary US brands.
Of course, this shift is partly a result of the secular factors that have driven China’s rapid growth and global expansion.
But it also reflects China’s long-term strategy to cement its position in one of the world’s most attractive emerging markets.
By 2030, Latin America and the Caribbean will have a combined population of around 720 million people.
According to conservative forecasts, its GDP will amount to around $9 trillion, with just six economies – Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, Colombia, Chile, and Peru –accounting for 86% of that total.
Moreover, countries in Latin America and the Caribbean are moving toward becoming an integrated bloc.
Thanks to a host of agreements, fully 80% of trade among Latin American and Caribbean countries is already tariff-free.
Various trade-facilitation measures, from paperless customs procedures to the harmonization of rules of origin, are steadily dismantling remaining barriers.
The two largest regional blocs – Mercosur and the Pacific Alliance, both of which include the region’s six largest economies – are taking seriously the possibility of convergence.
This trend toward greater regional integration will offer a unique opportunity to tap an entire highly lucrative market from a few beachheads.
Chinese companies that are now making acquisitions and building factories in Brazil, for example, will be able to distribute their products on preferential terms in neighboring countries, while harnessing regional value chains for parts and raw materials.
Like China, the European Union recognizes Latin America’s vast potential as a trading partner.
To be sure, the EU’s share of total Latin American imports has been declining, and now stands at 13.5%.
But it is working hard to reverse this trend, including by completing agreements that cover nearly all of the region’s economies.
And negotiations on a free-trade agreement with the Mercosur countries are in the final stages.
This will put Europe ahead of both China and the US in terms of market access.
But China continues to work hard on many fronts to cement an advantageous position in Latin America, including by pouring large volumes of direct investment into the region.
By some estimates, it has plowed more than $106 billion into Latin America in recent years, including $60 billion in Brazil alone.
Chinese investment has so far gone primarily to agriculture, energy, and mining projects.
But a growing share is now being channeled to manufacturing in sectors that generate higher-wage jobs and transfer much-needed skills to host economies.
In addition, China has become a major underwriter of the new infrastructure that Latin America urgently needs.
It is framing these investments within the narrative of its Belt and Road Initiative, a global vision for connectivity, cooperation, and prosperity that resonates powerfully with Latin American leaders.
As China and the EU seize opportunities in Latin America and the Caribbean, the US continues to cede market share.
Yet this is its neighborhood, and it could easily propose a similar integration initiative here.
And the US certainly has strong incentive to pursue a strategy of active re-engagement with Latin America: the Inter-American Development Bank calculates that if the US were to reclaim the share of Latin American imports that it had in 2000, it could be exporting around $788 billion each year to the region.
That is enough to support around one million additional US jobs.
Such a strategy could harness the goodwill and enterprise of the 57 million US citizens who have roots south of the Rio Grande, including the 3.3 million US Hispanic-owned firms, many of which are eager to expand overseas.
It might even help to steer the bitter debates over migration and trafficking of drugs and firearms in a more productive direction.
In a time of global uncertainty, a vision of “made in the Americas” prosperity provides a unifying agenda for the continent.
If implemented, the US could reassert its historical leadership among a group of countries that share its fundamental values, as well as an interest in inclusive economic growth and rising living standards.
America’s Looming Debt Decision
BOGOTÁ – Should the US government lock in today’s ultra-low borrowing costs by issuing longer-term debt?
It’s a tough call, but with overall debt levels already high (not to mention unfunded pension and medical insurance liabilities, which are both likely to rise), perhaps the time has come.
Until now, the US Treasury and the Federal Reserve Board, acting in combination, have worked to keep down long-term government debt, in order to reduce interest rates for the private sector.
Indeed, at this point, the average duration of US debt (integrating the Fed’s balance sheet) is now under three years, well below that of most European countries, even taking into account their own central banks’ massive quantitative-easing (QE) programs.
The tilt toward short-term borrowing as a way to try to stimulate the economy has made sense until now.
Given that the interest rate on 30-year US debt is roughly 200 basis points higher than on one-year debt, short-term borrowing has saved the government money as well.
But the government should not operate like a bank or a hedge fund, loading up on short-term debt to fund long-term projects.
It is too risky. With net US government debt already running at 82% of national income, the potential fiscal costs of a fast upward shift in interest rates could be massive.
No one is saying that such a shift is likely or imminent, but the odds aren’t as trivial as some might like to believe.
For starters, interest rates could spike in the event of a war or some other catastrophic event.
Less dramatic but more likely is that the Fed will someday find a way to push up inflation expectations, which, as in most advanced economies, have been drifting inexorably downward.
If inflation expectations do start rising, this will push up rates.
A rise in borrowing rates could also come from self-inflicted damage.
Suppose, for example, that US voters elect as their president an unpredictable and incompetent businessman, who views bankruptcy as just business as usual.
Alternatively, it is not difficult to imagine a sequence of highly populist leaders who embrace the quack idea that the level of government debt is basically irrelevant and should never be an obstacle to maximizing public spending.
Unfortunately, if the US ever did face an abrupt normalization of interest rates, it could require significant tax and spending adjustments.
And the overall burden, including unemployment, would almost surely fall disproportionately on the poor, a fact that populists who believe that debt is a free lunch conveniently ignore.
Mind you, lengthening borrowing maturities does not have to imply borrowing less.
Most economists agree that larger deficits make sense if used to pay for necessary infrastructure and education improvements, not to mention enhancing domestic physical and cyber security.
There is a significant backlog of worthy projects, and real (inflation-adjusted) interest rates are low (though, properly measured, real rates may be significantly higher than official measures suggest, mainly because the government’s inability to account properly for the benefits of new goods causes it to overstate inflation).
One hopes that the next president will create an infrastructure task force with substantial independence and technocratic expertise to help curate project proposals, as the United Kingdom’s pre-Brexit government did.
With control of the global reserve currency, the US has room to borrow; nonetheless, it should structure its borrowing wisely.
Several years ago, it still made sense for the Fed to do cartwheels to bring down long-term borrowing costs.
Today, with the economy normalizing, the case for creative policies like QE, which effectively shortens government debt by sucking long-term bonds out of the market, seems much weaker.
That is why the time has come for the US Treasury to consider borrowing at longer horizons than it has in recent years.
Today, the longest maturity debt issued by the US government is the 30-year bond.
Yet Spain has successfully issued 50-year debt at a very low rate, while Ireland, Belgium, and even Mexico have issued 100-year debt.
Sure, there is no guarantee that rates won’t drop even more in the future, but the point is to have a less risky stream of future interest obligations.
Many left-leaning polemicists point to Japan, where net debt is about 140% of GDP, as proof that much higher debt is a great idea, despite the country’s anemic growth record.
The implication is that there is little need to worry about debt at all, much less its maturity structure.
In fact, Japanese policymakers and economists are plenty worried and do not recommend that other countries emulate their country’s debt position.
Europe is admittedly in a very different place, with much higher unemployment, and a much stronger argument for continuing to pursue stimulus at the risk of higher debt-service costs in the future.
But with the US economy now enjoying a solid recovery, the best approach may be to move faster toward normalizing debt policy, and not to assume that foreign lenders will be patient, regardless of the direction of US politics.
How Would Health-Care Reform Affect Patient Health?
CAMBRIDGE – Health-care reform is the major policy issue commanding attention in the United States.
A crucial feature of the debate is the official estimate of the number of individuals who would lose their health insurance under the various plans that have been proposed to repeal and replace the existing Affordable Care Act (better known as “Obamacare”).
The prospect that repealing Obamacare would cause more than 20 million people to lose their formal insurance coverage, as the Congressional Budget Office has estimated, is understandably a serious barrier to legislative progress.
It is important, therefore, to understand just what that would mean in practice, and how much it would actually affect the health of those who lose their formal insurance.
The primary reason for the loss of insurance in the proposals to repeal and replace Obamacare is the projected decline in Medicaid coverage.
Medicaid is the joint federal-state health-care program in which the federal government defines who is eligible, stipulates which benefits must be provided, and finances those benefits based on a formula whereby states with low average incomes receive a larger share of federal funding.
People who qualify for Medicaid do receive substantially more care than those without formal insurance – more doctor visits, prescriptions, hospital admissions, etc.
They also have substantially lower out-of-pocket medical costs than the uninsured, including the elimination of “catastrophic” out-of-pocket costs.
As a result, they are also much less likely to skip paying other bills because of medical debts or to have nonmedical bills sent to collection.
If reform legislation reduces Medicaid benefits, the individuals who lose benefits would continue to receive free care in outpatient departments, emergency rooms, and as hospital in-patients.
In general, this is paid for by the states through their “free care” programs.
And individuals who are billed for services understand that providers generally do not attempt to collect from low-income patients.
Moreover, those who are no longer in the Medicaid program do not lose care from the many doctors who now refuse to serve Medicaid patients because of the low fees allowed in the program.
The most important fact to bear in mind is that enrollees in Medicaid show no significant improvement in clinical physical health outcomes.
This was the main finding of a large “natural experiment” supported by the federal government.
The experiment occurred when the state of Oregon opened enrollment to Medicaid in 2008, after the opportunity had been closed for many years.
Because the state did not have enough funds to accept all 90,000 individuals who wanted to enroll, it conducted a lottery to select about 30,000 individuals who were given the opportunity to apply for Medicaid.
A federally financed research team of physicians and health-care economists examined hospital records and other clinical information and also spoke with the enrollees and with those not admitted.
The researchers concluded that self-reported overall health and depression improved among those who enrolled in Medicaid, and that there was an increase in the diagnosis and treatment of diabetes for this group.
But there was no significant improvement in clinical physical outcomes for conditions including hypertension, high cholesterol, or diabetes.
Although the evidence indicates that the proposed cutbacks in federal dollars for Medicaid would not harm the physical health of those who lost their coverage, the reduction would force states to increase spending on their free-care programs.
The cuts would also increase the costs to hospitals that provide care that is not reimbursed.
It is not surprising that the prospect of adding these costs for tens of millions of patients to states’ budgets and to hospital costs causes state governors and hospital administrators to protest when Congress proposes cutting back on the Medicaid program.
But it is important for the public and members of Congress to understand the real reason for their opposition.
An Agenda for US-Iran Negotiations
DENVER – US President Donald Trump has decided not to certify that Iran is in compliance with the terms of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), the agreement constraining Iran’s nuclear-weapons program.
In effect, Trump has challenged the US Congress to do what is normally the executive branch’s responsibility: create foreign policy.
What that policy will be remains an open question.
While Congress is already preparing sanctions, these will not, on their own, comprise a comprehensive Iran strategy.
Instead, the US and Iran will need to negotiate directly on a range of non-nuclear issues.
As it stands, few assert that Iran is actually failing to comply with its obligations under the JCPOA.
Even US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who has made no secret of his disdain for Iran, complains only that Iranian leaders are violating the “spirit” of the deal.
But the JCPOA is clearly – and deliberately – focused on curbing Iran’s nuclear-weapons development, not its missile programs, regional ambitions, or animus toward Israel.
The Trump administration also takes issue with the time limits on the JCPOA, with some provisions – such as strict limits on research and development of advanced centrifuges – in effect for just ten years.
Trump’s denunciations of the deal have fueled debate over the appropriateness of the time limits, though such discussions often fail to recognize that Iran agreed to adhere to International Atomic Energy Agency standards, including its advanced inspection protocols.
In any case, the key to preventing recidivism after the JCPOA sunset provisions expire will be to move Iran toward good-neighbor polices, and to ensure that its economic interests supersede its ambition to become a regional hegemon.
That is where bilateral negotiations come in.
One reason why the JCPOA did not cover non-nuclear issues is that several other partners and allies – namely, China, France, Germany, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the European Union – were involved, and each had its own perspective and objectives.
Regional powers with ringside seats to the talks, such as Saudi Arabia, also had plenty to say.
Reconciling these actors’ conflicting interests and demands concerning the full range of relevant issues would have been next to impossible.
Bilateral negotiations between the US and Iran, however, might allow the US to make progress on the issues that are important to it – and, equally significant, to understand modern Iran better.
Such negotiations would likely start with a lengthy discussion of the two sides’ conflicting interpretations of the history of their relationship – in other words, each country’s grievances with the other.
For Iran, such grievances include US support for the 1953 coup in Iran, and America’s subsequent ties to the Shah and his brutal secret police, the Savak.
The US, for its part, would probably raise the 1979 abduction of US embassy staff by Iran’s fledgling Islamic revolutionary regime, and, more recently, its targeting of American troops using Shia militia groups in southern Iraq.
These discussions should include detailed questions and specific answers.
Working groups might be created to try to create a common narrative.
The negotiations would also need to cover contemporary issues, including a tour d’horizon of current hotspots.
What is Iran doing in Yemen, Lebanon, Iraq, and especially Syria?
How does it define its interests in these countries?
Does it actually see itself, as many Sunni Arabs assert, as a protector of Shia Arabs?
In Iraq, the US invested heavily in toppling Saddam Hussein’s regime and then in supporting a political process that has produced a Shia-led government – a positive outcome, from Iran’s perspective.
The key question, then, is why Iran continues to support militia groups that have often undermined Iraq’s government.
As for Syria, Iran moved quickly to support President Bashar al-Assad’s government.
Iran’s backing of an administration dominated by the minority Alawites (a Shia sect) has clearly unnerved Sunni Arab states, especially Saudi Arabia, which regards with great concern this “Shia crescent” just across its northern frontier.
Iran cannot really expect the Saudis to be indifferent to such a change in their geostrategic position.
But Iran is not the only actor that must explain its Syria strategy.
The US, too, has so far pursued policies that, to put it mildly, have not always had a self-evident rationale.
Now is the time for the US to put its cards on the table.
Does it seek regime change, or would it settle for policy changes by whatever government Syrians eventually choose?
And what about Israel?
During his presidency from 2005 to 2013, Iran’s Mahmoud Ahmadinejad inflamed world opinion by repeatedly questioning whether the Holocaust happened.
Does this kind of ignorance and contempt for the Jewish people persist among Iran’s current leadership, coloring their approach to Israel?
The final vital issue that must be addressed in any bilateral talks between the US and Iran is the latter’s military activity and, in particular, its missile programs.
Iran frequently alludes to its right to maintain a modern military, with advanced missiles, though unlike, say, North Korea, it stops short of claiming a right to nuclear weapons.
To determine the appropriate role and capabilities of Iran’s military, direct talks between the US and Iranian militaries, like those the US has pursued with China, might be in order.
The US cannot continue to base its policy toward Iran – a huge country with a population of over 80 million, a growing economy, and strong regional influence – on sanctions and vitriol.
Likewise, Iran needs to retire poisonous slogans like “Death to America” and instead work with the US to advance its own interests and aspirations.
Perhaps the mountain of mistrust will turn out to be too high for the two countries to scale.
But getting to the other side is worth a try.
Anti-Trade America?
CAMBRIDGE – The rise of anti-trade populism in the 2016 US election campaign portends a dangerous retreat from the United States’ role in world affairs.
In the name of reducing US inequality, presidential candidates in both parties would stymie the aspirations of hundreds of millions of desperately poor people in the developing world to join the middle class.
If the political appeal of anti-trade policies proves durable, it will mark a historic turning point in global economic affairs, one that bodes ill for the future of American leadership.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has proposed slapping a 45% tax on Chinese imports into the US, a plan that appeals to many Americans who believe that China is getting rich from unfair trade practices.
But, for all its extraordinary success in recent decades, China remains a developing country where a significant share of the population live at a level of poverty that would be unimaginable by Western standards.
Consider China’s new five-year plan, which aims to lift 55 million people above the poverty line by 2020, a threshold defined as just CN¥2,300, or $354, per year. This compares with a poverty line of around $12,000 for a single person in the US.
Yes, there are significant cost-of-living differences that make direct comparisons dubious, and, yes, poverty is as much a social condition as an economic one, at least in advanced economies; but the general point that inequality between countries swamps inequality within countries is a very powerful one.
And China’s poverty problem is hardly the world’s worst.
India and Africa both have populations roughly comparable to China’s 1.4 billion people, with significantly smaller shares having reached the middle class.
Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders is a far more appealing individual than “The Donald,” but his anti-trade rhetoric is almost as dangerous.
Following prominent left-leaning economists, Sanders rails against the proposed new Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), even though it would do much to help the developing world – for example, by opening up Japan’s market to Latin American imports.
Sanders even hammers his opponent Hillary Clinton for her support of earlier trade deals such as the 1992 North America Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
Yet that agreement forced Mexico to lower its tariffs on US goods far more than it forced the US to reduce its already low tariffs on Mexican goods.
Unfortunately, the resounding success of Sanders’s and Trump’s anti-trade rhetoric has pulled Clinton away from her more centrist position, and might have the same effect on many members of the House and Senate. This is a recipe for disaster.
The TPP does have its flaws, particularly in its overshoot on protection of intellectual property rights.
But the idea that the deal will be a huge job killer for the US is highly debatable, and something does need to be done to make it easier to sell high-tech goods to the developing world, including China, without fear that such goods will be instantly cloned.
A failure to ratify the TPP would almost certainly condemn tens of millions of people in the developing world to continued poverty.
The right remedy to reduce inequality within the US is not to walk away from free trade, but to introduce a better tax system, one that is simpler and more progressive.
Ideally, there would be a shift from income taxation to a progressive consumption tax (the simplest example being a flat tax with a very high exemption).
The US also desperately needs deep structural reform of its education system, clearing obstacles to introducing technology and competition.
Indeed, new technologies offer the prospect of making it far easier to retrain and retool workers of all ages.
Those who advocate redistribution by running larger government budget deficits are being short sighted.
Given adverse demographics in the advanced world, slowing productivity, and rising pension obligations, it is very hard to know what the endgame of soaring debt would be.
Do pro-deficit progressives realize that the burden of any future debt crises (or financial-repression measures) are likely to fall disproportionately on poor and middle-income citizens, as they have in the past?
Simple redistribution of income through taxes and transfers is far more direct and more potent, and would certainly serve to expand aggregate demand.
Anyone who portrays the US as a huge loser from the global economic status quo needs to gain some perspective on the matter.
I have little doubt that a century from now, Americans’ consumption-centric lifestyle will no longer be viewed as something to envy and emulate, and the country’s failure to implement a carbon tax will be viewed as a massive failure.
With under 5% of the world’s population, the US accounts for a vastly disproportionate share of carbon-dioxide emissions and other pollution, with much of the blame falling on America’s middle class.
But the idea that trade fuels inequality is a very parochial perspective, and protectionists who shroud themselves in a moralistic inequality narrative are deeply hypocritical.
As far as trade is concerned, the current US presidential campaign is an embarrassment of substance, not just of personality.
The End of US Soft Power?
NEW DELHI – One major casualty of Donald Trump’s victory in the bruising US presidential election is, without a doubt, America’s soft power around the world.
It is a development that will be difficult – perhaps even impossible – to reverse, especially for Trump.
Traditionally, countries’ global political power was assessed according to military might: the one with the largest army had the most power.
But that logic was not always reflected in reality.
The US lost the Vietnam War; the Soviet Union was defeated in Afghanistan.
In its first few years in Iraq, the US discovered the wisdom of Talleyrand’s adage that the one thing you cannot do with a bayonet is sit on it.
Enter soft power.
The term was coined by Harvard’s Joseph S. Nye in 1990 to account for the influence a country – and, in particular, the US – wields, beyond its military (or “hard”) power.
As Nye put it, a country’s power rests on its “ability to alter the behavior of others” to get what it wants, whether through coercion (sticks), payments (carrots), or attraction (soft power).
“If you are able to attract others,” he pointed out, “you can economize on the sticks and carrots.”
Nye argues that a country’s soft power arises from “its culture (in places where it is attractive to others), its political values (when it lives up to them at home and abroad), and its foreign policies (when they are seen as legitimate and having moral authority.)”
But I believe that it also emerges from the world’s perceptions of what a country is about: the associations and attitudes conjured by the mention of a country’s name. Hard power is exercised; soft power is evoked.
The US has been the world’s largest economy and oldest democracy, a haven for immigrants, and the land of the American Dream – the promise that anyone can be anything if they work hard enough.
It is also the home of Boeing and Intel, Google and Apple, Microsoft and MTV, Hollywood and Disneyland, McDonald’s and Starbucks – in short, some of the most recognizable and influential brands and industries in the world.
The attractiveness of these assets, and of the American lifestyle that they represent, is that they enable the US to persuade, rather than compel, others to adopt its agenda.
In this sense, soft power acts as both an alternative and a complement to hard power.
But there are limits to a country’s soft power – even America’s.
In the wake of the US terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, there was an outpouring of goodwill for the US.
Then the country launched its War on Terror, in which it relied heavily on hard power.
The instruments of that power – the Iraq invasion, indefinite detention of “enemy combatants” and other suspects at Guantánamo Bay prison, the Abu Ghraib scandal, revelations of CIA “black sites,” the killing of Iraqi civilians by private US security contractors – were not received well by the global public.
America’s soft-power assets were inadequate to compensate for the deficiencies of its hard-power approach.
Fans of American culture were not prepared to overlook the excesses of Guantánamo.
Using Microsoft Windows does not predispose you to accept torture by the country that produces it.
America’s soft power declined sharply, demonstrating that how a country exercises its hard power affects how much soft power it can evoke.
America’s domestic narrative soon overcame its foreign-policy setbacks, thanks partly to today’s unprecedented connectivity.
In a world of instant mass communications, countries are judged by a global public fed on a diet of relentless online news, smartphone videos, and Twitter gossip.
In such an information age, Nye wrote, three types of countries are likely to gain soft power: “those whose dominant cultures and ideals are closer to prevailing global norms (which now emphasize liberalism, pluralism, autonomy); those with the most access to multiple channels of communication and thus more influence over how issues are framed; and those whose credibility is enhanced by their domestic and international performance.”
The US had done pretty well on all of these fronts.
Indeed, America’s culture and ideals set the bar for others, and its international credibility rested on its domestic arrangements.
Overcoming the legacy of centuries of slavery and racism to elect a black president in 2008 and again in 2012 seemed to embody the country’s capacity to reinvent and renew itself.
Trump’s ascent to power has shattered that image.
It has exposed and encouraged tendencies the world never used to associate with the US: xenophobia, misogyny, pessimism, and selfishness.
A system that promised a level playing field on which anyone could fulfill their aspirations is being denounced by its own political leaders as stacked against ordinary citizens.
A country that confidently counsels others on democratic practice has elected a president who suggested that, if he lost, he might not recognize the result.
Nye has argued that, in an information age, soft power often accrues to the country with the better story.
The US has long been the “land of the better story.”
It has a free press and an open society; it welcomes migrants and refugees; it has a thirst for new ideas and a knack for innovation.
All of this has given the US an extraordinary ability to tell stories that are more persuasive and attractive than those of its rivals.
But the story of America told in this election has deeply diminished the soft power the US evokes.
Fear trumped hope.
The American Dream became the world’s nightmare.
And the demons released from Pandora’s box in 2016 – echoing in widespread reports of racist taunts by Trump supporters of non-whites in America – will continue to roam free in the country’s self-perception, and taint everyone else’s perception, too.
In our eyes, America will never be the same – and Trump’s term hasn’t even begun.
The US Plutocracy’s War on Sustainable Development
NEW YORK – The US plutocracy has declared war on sustainable development.
Billionaires such as Charles and David Koch (oil and gas), Robert Mercer (finance), and Sheldon Adelson (casinos) play their politics for personal financial gain.
They fund Republican politicians who promise to cut their taxes, deregulate their industries, and ignore the warnings of environmental science, especially climate science.
When it comes to progress toward achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, the US placed 42nd out of 157 countries in a recent ranking of the SDG Index that I help to lead, far below almost all other high-income countries.
Danish author Bjørn Lomborg was puzzled.
How could such a rich country score so low?
“America-bashing is popular and easy,” he surmised.
Yet this is not about America-bashing.
The SDG Index is built on internationally comparable data relevant to the 17 Sustainable Development Goals for 157 countries.
The real point is this: sustainable development is about social inclusion and environmental sustainability, not just wealth.
The US ranks far behind other high-income countries because America's plutocracy has for many years turned its back on social justice and environmental sustainability.
The US is indeed a rich country, but Lord Acton’s famous aphorism applies to nations as well as to individuals: power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.
The US plutocracy has wielded so much power for so long that it acts with impunity vis-à-vis the weak and the natural environment.
Four powerful lobbies have long held sway: Big Oil, private health care, the military-industrial complex, and Wall Street.
These special interests feel especially empowered now by Donald Trump’s administration, which is filled with corporate lobbyists, not to mention several right-wing billionaires in the cabinet.
While the Sustainable Development Goals call for mitigating climate change through decarbonization (SDG 7, SDG 13), US fossil-fuel companies are strenuously resisting.
Under the sway of Big Oil and Big Coal, Trump announced his intention to withdraw the US from the Paris climate agreement.
America’s annual energy-related per capita CO2 emissions, at 16.4 tons, are the highest in the world for a large economy.
The comparable figure for Germany, for example, is 9.2 tons.
The US Environmental Protection Agency, now in the hands of lobbyists from the fossil-fuel sector, dismantles environmental regulations every week (though many of these actions are being challenged in court).
The SDGs also call for reduced income inequality (SDG 10).
America’s income inequality has soared in the past 30 years, with the Gini coefficient at 41.1, the second highest among high-income economies, just behind Israel (at 42.8).
Republican proposals for tax cuts would increase inequality further.
The US rate of relative poverty (households at less than half of median income), at 17.5%, is also the second highest in the OECD (again just behind Israel).
Likewise, while the SDGs target decent jobs for all (SDG 8), American workers are nearly the only ones in the OECD that lack guaranteed paid sick leave, family leave, and vacation days.
The result is that more and more Americans work in miserable conditions without job protections.
Around nine million American workers are stuck below the poverty line.
The US also suffers from an epidemic of malnutrition at the hands of the powerful US fast-food industry, which has essentially poisoned the public with diets loaded with saturated fats, sugar, and unhealthy processing and chemical additives.
The result is an obesity rate of 33.7%, the highest by far in the OECD, with enormous adverse consequences for non-communicable diseases.
America’s “healthy life expectancy” (morbidity-free years) is only 69.1 years, compared to 74.9 years in Japan and 73.1 years in Switzerland.
While the Sustainable Development Goals emphasize peace (SDG 16), America’s military-industrial complex pursues open-ended wars (Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Yemen, Libya, to name some of America’s current engagements) and large-scale arms sales.
On his recent visit to Saudi Arabia, Trump signed a deal to sell over $100 billion in weapons to the country, boasting that it would mean “jobs, jobs, jobs” in America’s defense sector.
America’s plutocracy contributes to homegrown violence as well.
The US homicide rate, 3.9 per 100,000, is the highest of any OECD country, and several times higher than in Europe (Germany’s rate is 0.9 per 100,000).
Month after month, there are mass shootings in the US, such as the massacre in Las Vegas.
Yet the political power of the gun lobby, which opposes limits even on assault weapons, has blocked the adoption of measures that would boost public safety.
Another kind of violence is mass incarceration.
With 716 inmates per 100,000 people, America has the world’s highest incarceration rate, roughly ten times that of Norway (71 per 100,000).
Remarkably, America has partly privatized its prisons, creating an industry with an overriding interest in maximizing the number of prisoners.
Former President Barack Obama issued a directive to phase out private federal prisons, but the Trump administration reversed it.
Lomborg also wonders why the US gets a low score on global “Partnership for the Goals,” even though the US gave around $33.6 billion in official development assistance (ODA) in 2016.
The answer is easy: relative to gross national income of almost $19 trillion, ODA spending by the US amounted to just 0.18% of GNI – roughly a quarter of the global target of 0.7% of GDP.
America’s low ranking in the SDG Index is not America-bashing.
Rather, it is a sad and troubling reflection of the wealth and power of lobbies relative to ordinary citizens in US politics.
I recently helped to launch an effort to refocus state-level US politics around sustainable development, through a set of America’s Goals that candidates for state legislatures are beginning to adopt.
I am confident that a post-Trump America will recommit itself to the values of the common good, both within America and as a global partner for sustainable development.
Profiles in Cowardice
NEW YORK – The fate of nations often comes down to the choices made by a handful of individuals at a particular moment in history.
Today, the United States is facing just such a moment.
What a handful of individual Republicans decide will shape the future not just of the country, but of democracy itself.
Modern history is littered with similarly pivotal choices, for better or worse.
A century ago, the Russian Revolution came down to a showdown between the iron will of Vladimir Lenin and the indecisiveness of Alexander Kerensky, who ended up sneaking out of Saint Petersburg to escape the Bolsheviks.
Another Russian revolution – on New Year’s Eve 1999, when President Vladimir Putin gained the government foothold that ultimately enabled him to rule the country to this day – also came down to a solitary selfish decision by the country’s then-leader.
Choosing to prioritize his own safety and that of his family over the wellbeing of Russia, President Boris Yeltsin named Putin, a former KGB colonel, as his successor.
On a more positive note, where would France be today, if, in June 1940, the then-relatively unknown General Charles de Gaulle had not gone into exile and delivered his passionate call for his country to resist the Nazi invaders?
Where would the West be had anyone other than Winston Churchill become British prime minister that year?
The US has also had its share of such pivotal moments, several of which were described by John F. Kennedy in his book Profiles in Courage, which he wrote before becoming president.
For example, Secretary of State Daniel Webster supported the Compromise of 1850, despite his hatred of slavery, in order to save the union.
Similarly, Robert Taft denounced the Nuremberg Trials, despite his hatred of the Nazis, to defend the fundamental US legal principle that a person could not be criminally charged on the basis of a retroactive statute.
Webster and Taft, like the six others that Kennedy examined, risked political and reputational ruin to take difficult decisions, because they believed themselves to be defending the best interests of their country.
Such political courage is not a thing of the past.
Last week, 11 Conservative members of the British parliament balked at giving Prime Minister Theresa May’s government “Henry VIII powers” – the authority to create new laws or eliminate old ones, without parliamentary approval.
Led by former Attorney General Dominic Grieve, the rebel Tory MPs refused to countenance such a step, regardless of the cost.
And that cost turned out to be high: Grieve received death threats, and others were sacked by the Tory leadership.
The US today is one place where such bravery and selflessness cannot be glimpsed.
Yet, as President Donald Trump and a majority of Congressional Republicans attempt to pass a tax bill that would benefit America’s wealthiest households at the expense of saddling the country with more than $1 trillion in additional debt, such courage could not be more necessary.
US Republicans have long decried any measure that increases the US budget deficit.
Rob Portman of Ohio even served as Director of the White House Office of Management and Budget under President George W Bush.
Yet now they support tax cuts that will cause the deficit to grow as much, if not more, than it did under President Barack Obama.
(And Obama, it should be noted, was attempting to stave off another Great Depression, not to deliver big tax savings to wealthy donors.)
To be sure, seven Republican senators – Susan Collins of Maine, Robert Corker of Tennessee, Jeff Flake and John McCain of Arizona, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, and Marco Rubio of Florida – have voiced concerns about the bill.
These concerns echo more fundamental fears, voiced by the same senators to varying degrees, that the Trump administration is doing serious harm to US institutions.
But even these senators now appear to have fallen into line, effectively promising to deliver Trump an important legislative victory that will help to buttress his floundering presidency, while deepening inequality in the longer term.
In doing so, they are putting tribal partisan loyalty above concern for their country.
Of course, it is hard to ask for more heroism from McCain.
His courage as a prisoner of war for five years in Vietnam seems to be doubted only by Trump, and the dignified way he is battling brain cancer today has only heightened the esteem in which most Americans hold him.
But the fact is that McCain is now backing away from his call, made on his return to the Senate after brain surgery, for a return to the “old way of legislating in the Senate,” including thorough public committee hearings on bills.
McCain’s fellow senator from Arizona is similarly failing to back word with deed.
Flake, whose memoir is called The Conscience of a Conservative, recently delivered a searing speech on the Senate floor denouncing Trump, whom Flake sees as threatening American “principles, freedoms, and institutions,” disregarding “truth and decency,” and engaging in petty and “reckless provocations.”
Yet Flake will support Trump’s tax bill without so much as a grimace.
Murkowski and Collins played a vital role in preventing the Trump-supported repeal of the 2010 Affordable Care Act and its replacement with a much crueler health-care bill.
Corker, too, has presented himself as somehow apart from the Trumpian mire.
Yet, when it comes to tax cuts for the rich, these figures are as willing as any firm Trump acolyte to trade their honor for the approval of their tribe.
Years from now, some young and ambitious politician will survey the Trump presidency and, in an effort to explain the events that are unfolding before us, pen a Kennedyesque Profiles in Cowardice focused on Republicans’ lack of personal integrity.
The question is what will have become of American democracy by then.
The World’s Priciest Stock Market
NEW HAVEN – The level of stock markets differs widely across countries.
And right now, the United States is leading the world.
What everyone wants to know is why – and whether its stock market’s current level is justified.
We can get a simple intuitive measure of the differences between countries by looking at price-earnings ratios.
I have long advocated the cyclically adjusted price-earnings (CAPE) ratio that John Campbell (now at Harvard University) and I developed 30 years ago.
The CAPE ratio is the real (inflation-adjusted) price of a share divided by a ten-year average of real earnings per share.
Barclays Bank in London compiles the CAPE ratios for 26 countries (I consult for Barclays on its products related to the CAPE ratio).
As of December 29, the CAPE ratio is highest for the US.
Let’s consider what these ratios mean.
Ownership of stock represents a long-term claim on a company’s earnings, which the company can pay to the owners of shares as dividends or reinvest to provide the shareholders more dividends in the future.
A share in a company is not just a claim on next year’s earnings, or on earnings the year after that.
Successful companies last for decades, even centuries.
So, to arrive at a valuation for a country’s stock market, we need to forecast the growth rate of earnings and dividends for an interval considerably longer than a year.
We really want to know what the earnings will do over the next ten or 20 years.
But how can one be confident of long-term forecasts of earnings growth across countries?
In pricing stock markets, people don’t seem to be relying on any good forecast of the next ten years’ earnings.
They just seem to look at the past ten years, which are already done and gone, but also known and tangible.
But when Campbell and I studied earnings growth in the US with long historical data, we found that it has not been very amenable to extrapolation.
Since 1881, the correlation of the past decade’s real earnings growth with the price-earnings ratio is a positive 0.32.
But there is zero correlation between the CAPE ratio and the next ten years’ real earnings growth.
And real earnings growth per share for the S&P Composite Stock Price Index over the previous ten years was negatively correlated (-17% since 1881) with real earnings growth over the subsequent ten years.
That’s the opposite of momentum.
It means that good news about earnings growth in the past decade is (slightly) bad news about earnings growth in the future.
Essentially the same sort of thing happens with US inflation and the bond market.
One might think that long-term interest rates tend to be high when there is evidence that there will be higher inflation over the life of the bond, to compensate investors for the expected decline in the dollar’s purchasing power.
Using data since 1913, when the consumer price index computed by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics starts, we find that the there is almost no correlation between long-term interest rates and ten-year inflation rates over succeeding decades.
While positive, the correlation between one decade’s total inflation and the next decade’s total inflation is only 2%.
But bond markets act as if they think inflation can be extrapolated.
Long-term interest rates tend to be high when the last decade’s inflation was high.
US long-term bond yields, such as the ten-year Treasury yield, are highly positively correlated (70% since 1913) with the previous ten years’ inflation.
But the correlation between the Treasury yield and the inflation rate over the next ten years is only 28%.
How can we square investors’ behavior with the famous assertion that it is hard to beat the market?
Why haven’t growing reliance on data analytics and aggressive trading meant that, as markets become more efficient over time, all remaining opportunities to secure abnormal profits are competed away?
Economic theory, as exemplified by the work of Andrei Shleifer at Harvard and Robert Vishny of the University of Chicago, offers ample reason to expect that long-term investment opportunities will never be eliminated from markets, even when there are a lot of very smart people trading.
This brings us back to the mystery of what’s driving the US stock market higher than all others.
It’s not the “Trump effect,” or the effect of the recent cut in the US corporate tax rate.
After all, the US has pretty much had the world’s highest CAPE ratio ever since President Barack Obama’s second term began in 2013.
Nor is extrapolation of rapid earnings growth a significant factor, given that the latest real earnings per share for the S&P index are only 6% above their peak about ten years earlier, before the 2008 financial crisis erupted.
Part of the reason for America’s world-beating CAPE ratio may be its higher rate of share repurchases, though share repurchases have become a global phenomenon.
Higher CAPE ratios in the US may also reflect a stronger psychology of fear about the replacement of jobs by machines.
The flip side of that fear, as I argued in the third edition of my book Irrational Exuberance, is a stronger desire to own capital in a free-market country with an association with computers.
The truth is that it is impossible to pin down the full cause of the high price of the US stock market.
The lack of any clear justification for its high CAPE ratio should remind all investors of the importance of diversification, and that the overall US stock market should not be given too much weight in a portfolio.
The Coming Bear Market?
NEW HAVEN – The US stock market today is characterized by a seemingly unusual combination of very high valuations, following a period of strong earnings growth, and very low volatility.
What do these ostensibly conflicting messages imply about the likelihood that the United States is headed toward a bear market?
To answer that question, we must look to past bear markets.
And that requires us to define precisely what a bear market entails. The media nowadays delineate a “classic” or “traditional” bear market as a 20% decline in stock prices.
That definition does not appear in any media outlet before the 1990s, and there has been no indication of who established it.
It may be rooted in the experience of October 19, 1987, when the stock market dropped by just over 20% in a single day.
Attempts to tie the term to the “Black Monday” story may have resulted in the 20% definition, which journalists and editors probably simply copied from one another.
In any case, that 20% figure is now widely accepted as an indicator of a bear market.
Where there seems to be less overt consensus is on the time period for that decline.
Indeed, those past newspaper reports often didn’t mention any time period at all in their definitions of a bear market. Journalists writing on the subject apparently did not think it necessary to be precise.
In assessing America’s past experience with bear markets, I used that traditional 20% figure, and added my own timing rubric.
The peak before a bear market, per my definition, was the most recent 12-month high, and there should be some month in the subsequent year that is 20% lower.
Whenever there was a contiguous sequence of peak months, I took the last one.
Referring to my compilation of monthly S&P Composite and related data, I found that there have been just 13 bear markets in the US since 1871.
The peak months before the bear markets occurred in 1892, 1895, 1902, 1906, 1916, 1929, 1934, 1937, 1946, 1961, 1987, 2000, and 2007.
A couple of notorious stock-market collapses – in 1968-70 and in 1973-74 – are not on the list, because they were more protracted and gradual.
Once the past bear markets were identified, it was time to assess stock valuations prior to them, using an indicator that my Harvard colleague John Y. Campbell and I developed in 1988 to predict long-term stock-market returns.
The cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings (CAPE) ratio is found by dividing the real (inflation-adjusted) stock index by the average of ten years of earnings, with higher-than-average ratios implying lower-than-average returns.
Our research showed that the CAPE ratio is somewhat effective at predicting real returns over a ten-year period, though we did not report how well that ratio predicts bear markets.
This month, the CAPE ratio in the US is just above 30. That is a high ratio.
Indeed, between 1881 and today, the average CAPE ratio has stood at just 16.8.
Moreover, it has exceeded 30 only twice during that period: in 1929 and in 1997-2002.
But that does not mean that high CAPE ratios aren’t associated with bear markets.
On the contrary, in the peak months before past bear markets, the average CAPE ratio was higher than average, at 22.1, suggesting that the CAPE does tend to rise before a bear market.
Moreover, the three times when there was a bear market with a below-average CAPE ratio were after 1916 (during World War I), 1934 (during the Great Depression), and 1946 (during the post-World War II recession).
A high CAPE ratio thus implies potential vulnerability to a bear market, though it is by no means a perfect predictor.
To be sure, there does seem to be some promising news.
According to my data, real S&P Composite stock earnings have grown 1.8% per year, on average, since 1881.
From the second quarter of 2016 to the second quarter of 2017, by contrast, real earnings growth was 13.2%, well above the historical annual rate.
But this high growth does not reduce the likelihood of a bear market.
In fact, peak months before past bear markets also tended to show high real earnings growth: 13.3% per year, on average, for all 13 episodes.
Moreover, at the market peak just before the biggest ever stock-market drop, in 1929-32, 12-month real earnings growth stood at 18.3%.
Another piece of ostensibly good news is that average stock-price volatility – measured by finding the standard deviation of monthly percentage changes in real stock prices for the preceding year – is an extremely low 1.2%.
Between 1872 and 2017, volatility was nearly three times as high, at 3.5%.
Yet, again, this does not mean that a bear market isn’t approaching.
In fact, stock-price volatility was lower than average in the year leading up to the peak month preceding the 13 previous US bear markets, though today’s level is lower than the 3.1% average for those periods.
At the peak month for the stock market before the 1929 crash, volatility was only 2.8%.
In short, the US stock market today looks a lot like it did at the peaks before most of the country’s 13 previous bear markets.
This is not to say that a bear market is guaranteed: such episodes are difficult to anticipate, and the next one may still be a long way off.
And even if a bear market does arrive, for anyone who does not buy at the market’s peak and sell at the trough, losses tend to be less than 20%.
But my analysis should serve as a warning against complacency.
Investors who allow faulty impressions of history to lead them to assume too much stock-market risk today may be inviting considerable losses.
Tax Reform and Budget Deficits in America
CAMBRIDGE – The Republican Party’s leaders in the United States House of Representatives have been hard at work for more than a year designing a major reform of personal and corporate taxes.
With an election looming in 2018, the House Republicans are determined to deliver a reform package and send it to the Senate for enactment.
This reform will be very different from the last major tax overhaul enacted back in 1986.
The Tax Reform Act of 1986 focused on the personal income tax, lowering the top rate from 50% to 28% and cutting rates for lower-income taxpayers.
The revenue loss was offset by changes in tax deductions and other accounting rules, producing a reform that was revenue neutral at each income level, even without taking into account the effects of lower tax rates on increasing economic growth and taxable incomes.
In the 30 years since 1986, the tax rates for high-income taxpayers rose significantly, from 28% to 39.6%, with an extra 3.8% tax on these taxpayers’ investment income.
A detailed study by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) of taxes between 1979 and 2013 concluded that while the effective tax rate fell in every quintile of the income distribution, it rose well above that 35-year average for taxpayers in the top 1% of the income distribution.
The House Republican plan would cut the top tax rate back to 30% or lower, with comparable reductions for those now facing lower tax rates.
The new tax law might also follow the Canadian example and eliminate the estate tax, while imposing a tax on capital gains accrued before the taxpayer’s death.
To offset some of the resulting revenue loss, the new law might eliminate tax deductions for state and local taxes, and tax some of the fringe benefits that are currently excluded from taxable income.
The big difference between the House Republicans’ plan and the 1986 tax reform is that the current proposal would also address the tax treatment of corporate profits and other business income.
The statutory tax rate on corporate profits is now 35%, the highest in the OECD.
The new legislation would reduce that rate to 25% or less, spurring a shift in capital flows away from investments in housing and agriculture, and toward domestic corporate investment.
The new tax law is also likely to boost domestic corporate investment by changing the tax treatment of the profits of US corporations’ foreign subsidiaries.
Under current law, a subsidiary pays tax on profits to the government of the country where those profits are earned.
It can then invest the after-tax profits anywhere in the world outside the US.
But if it brings those funds back to the US to invest or pay dividends to shareholders, it must pay the full US corporate tax rate, with a credit for the tax already paid to the foreign government.
This penalty on repatriating funds causes US firms to leave those after-tax profits abroad.
The US Treasury estimates that American subsidiaries’ offshore investments stand at more than $2.5 trillion.
This method of taxing the profits of foreign subsidiaries is unique to the US.
Every other industrial country uses what is known as the territorial method, in which profits of foreign subsidiaries can be brought home with little or no extra tax.
By shifting the US toward such a system, the Republican proposal would stimulate repatriation of some of the funds that have been accumulated abroad, as well as increased inflows of future foreign profits.
What does all this mean for the budget deficit?
The CBO estimates that the deficit will rise from 3.4% of GDP to more than 4% over the next ten years, even with no change in tax rules.
The direct impact of lowering tax rates on personal income and corporate profits will be to reduce tax revenue and increase the budget deficit.
But this will be offset by limits on personal tax deductions and exclusions, and the lower tax rates on personal income will boost taxable incomes as individuals increase earnings and compensation shifts from fringe benefits to taxable cash.
Likewise, the move to a territorial tax system will raise taxable profits, especially in the short term, as companies repatriate some of the existing stock of overseas funds.
Although the net tax changes may widen the budget deficit in the short term, the incentive effects of lower tax rates and the increased accumulation of capital will mean faster economic growth and higher real incomes, both of which will cause rising taxable incomes and lower long-term deficits.
There is an important legislative reason why the projected budget will return to surplus in the future.
The Republicans have only a very small majority in the Senate, where the filibuster rule requires a three-fifths majority to pass most legislation, giving the Democrats the ability to block the Republican tax agenda.
But an exception allows tax and spending bills to be passed with a simple majority if the resulting budget returns to surplus after ten years.
By designing the tax and spending rules accordingly and phasing in future revenue increases, the Republicans can achieve the needed long-term surpluses.
As a result, I am optimistic that a tax reform serving to increase capital formation and growth will be enacted, and that any resulting increase in the budget deficit will be only temporary.
America’s Broken System
BERKELEY – The tax bill that US Republicans have doggedly pushed through Congress is not as big a deal as many are portraying it to be.
It is medium-size news.
The big news – the much more weighty and ominous news – lies elsewhere.
Of course, medium-size is not nothing.
If the tax bill does clear its final hurdle – a conference committee must reconcile the Senate-approved bill with that of the House of Representatives – and become law, it will complicate the tax system considerably, as it opens many loopholes.
It won’t have any impact on economic growth – positive or negative – but it would have an impact on the government’s finances, causing revenues to decline by the equivalent of about 1% of national income.
The missing resources would most likely be transferred to the top 1% of earners, raising their share of total income from 22% to 23%.
The top 0.01% would probably gain the most, with their share of income rising from 5.1% to 5.5%.
In this sense, the tax plan would be another brick – not a huge brick, but a medium-size brick – in the increasingly impregnable fortress of American plutocracy.
But the bill may well not become law at all.
Consider the Republicans’ efforts earlier this year to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act (“Obamacare”) – an effort that, it now seems clear, was pure Dingbat Kabuki.
The Republicans didn’t actually want to take responsibility for changing the health-care financing system, much less strip their own constituents of health care.
But the party’s propaganda arm had worked so hard to convince its base that Obamacare represented a clear and present danger to the country that its leaders had to act as if they were making a serious effort to fulfill their promise to repeal and replace it.
So a majority of Republicans in the House of Representatives voted for the bill, expecting, with reasonable confidence, that it would be blocked in the 100-member Senate, where fewer than 40 of the 52 Republicans actually wanted it to pass.
Had any of the three Republican senators who voted against the bill – John McCain of Arizona, Susan Collins of Maine, or Lisa Murkowski of Alaska – made a different choice, there were probably about five more who would have stepped in to nix it.
The same thing may be happening with the tax reform.
It depends on whether at least three of the ten Republican senators who have raised objections are serious, or are playing a different game of Dingbat Kabuki: seeking to trick their constituents into thinking that they went the extra mile to try to help them, and are not puppets of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.
But, regardless of whether the tax bill survives the reconciliation process and becomes law, the big news won’t change: the Anglo-Saxon model of representative government is in serious trouble.
And there is no solution in sight.
For some 400 years, the Anglo-Saxon governance model – exemplified by the republican semi-principality of the Netherlands, the constitutional monarchy of the United Kingdom, and the constitutional republic of the United States of America – was widely regarded as having hit the sweet spot of liberty, security, and prosperity.
The greater the divergence from that model, historical experience seemed to confirm, the higher the likelihood of repression, insecurity, and poverty.
So countries were frequently and strongly advised to emulate those institutions.
Nobody would dare offer that same advice today.
The UK, having been thrown into devastating austerity by Conservative and Liberal leaders after the global economic crisis, is now being led by the Conservatives toward a messy and damaging Brexit.
And, in the US, the election of President Donald Trump heralded the age of “alternative facts” and “governance by tweet,” overseen by an erratic and ignorant leader who is clearly in over his head.
When Trump was first elected, some argued that it did not have to be a disaster.
After all, the optimists pointed out, President Ronald Reagan had been more a “chief of state” than a “chief executive,” as had George W. Bush.
As divisive as Chief of State Trump would be, according to this view, he wouldn’t derail policy, because electing a Republican president is more like electing the Republican Party establishment.
And that bench was very deep and very competent, despite its weakening in recent years.
The optimists were wrong.
After nearly a year in control of both houses of Congress and the White House, the Republicans haven’t achieved any of their four policy goals: repeal and replacement of Obamacare, infrastructure development, trade-policy reform, or even tax reform.
This points to a broken system of politics and governance, one that Americans seem to have no idea how to fix.
The US remains the world’s preeminent superpower.
But doubts are intensifying over whether it’s still up to the job.
In this context, the Republicans’ tax reform, however economically indefensible and blatantly unfair it is, is far from America’s biggest concern.
The Varieties of Populist Experience
LONDON – Emmanuel Macron’s decisive defeat of Marine Le Pen in the French presidential runoff was a major victory for liberal Europe.
But it was a battle, not a war.
The idea that one in three French citizens would vote for the National Front’s Le Pen was inconceivable only a few years ago.
Commentators have affixed the “populist” label to the wave of demagogic politics sweeping Europe (and much of the rest of the world).
But, beyond the raucous style common to populists, what do these movements share?
After all, Spain’s Podemos and Greece’s Syriza are of the left.
France’s National Front, the Netherlands’ Party for Freedom, and Germany’s Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) are of the right.
Beppe Grillo, the leader of Italy’s Five Star Movement, says that his movement is neither left nor right.
And yet common themes run through all of them: economic nationalism, social protection, anti-Europeanism, anti-globalization, and hostility not just to the political establishment, but to politics itself.
To understand what this might mean for the evolution of European politics, consider the history of fascism.
Benito Mussolini, the founder of Italian fascism in 1919, started as a revolutionary socialist.
In Germany, the word Nazi was, we should recall, short for National Socialist German Workers’ Party.
Initially, fascism was a nationalist, anti-capitalist movement.
Later it confined its attack to liberal capitalism, especially “international finance.”
And this soon shaded into anti-Semitism – what the German Social Democrat August Bebel famously called “the socialism of fools.”
European fascism collapsed with the defeat of Germany in 1945, but less aggressive forms lived on elsewhere, such as Argentina with its Peronism.
The social base of interwar fascism made it reasonable to see it as a party of the right.
At the time, the working class dependably supported parties of the left.
The only political space left for fascism was the petit bourgeoisie: shopkeepers, small businessmen, and low-level civil servants.
Today, the social basis of left-wing politics has vanished.
The classic working class has disappeared: social democratic parties and trade unions are shadows of their former selves.
This means that left-wing populists are inevitably compelled to compete with right-wing populists for the support of exactly the same groups that turned to fascism between the wars: young unemployed males, the “small man” who feels threatened by the “oligarchy” of bankers, global supply chains, corrupt politicians, remote European Union bureaucrats, and “fat cats” of all kinds. Today’s populists, of whatever political stripe, increasingly target not just the same potential supporters, but the enemies as well.
How much space exists for populism’s further growth, and which variety – socialist or fascist – will attract the available votes?
The broad answer to the first part of the question was provided by former US President Bill Clinton’s 1992 election campaign: “It’s the economy, stupid.”
The EU has been the slowest of the world’s major economic centers to recover from the post-2008 slump.
In France, the unemployment rate is 10%.
Youth unemployment there is around 24%, and 34% in Italy – creating fertile recruiting ground for the extremes of left and right.
Though Macron is by no means an obsessive fiscal hawk, he wants to narrow the French government deficit from 3.4% to 3% of GDP, in line with the ceiling set by the EU’s Stability and Growth Pact.
In the firing line are 120,000 civil service jobs.
Yet he also wants to boost the economy with a €50 billion ($55 billion) stimulus package and extend the welfare state.
To square the circle, Macron needs growth, and he is relying on supply-side reforms to deliver it.
He plans to cut the corporate-tax rate from 33% to 25% and exclude financial investment from wealth taxation.
A vocal critic of protectionism, he will push for the EU-Canada Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership with the United States.
His support of the El Khomri law, which made it easier to fire workers, and his opposition to the 35-hour week, indicate his desire to increase the French labor market’s “flexibility.”
Despite talk of the “green economy” and calls for a Europe-wide investment program, Macron’s agenda is broadly neoliberal.
Essentially, Macron is hoping that his agenda, if implemented at the EU level, will lift not just the French economy, but all European boats.
In fact, the likelihood is that such reforms will sink all boats, giving the populists their chance.
In that case, which variety of populist will seize the opportunity?
The economist Dani Rodrik puts the appeal of populism into focus.
He argues that democracy, national sovereignty, and global economic integration are mutually incompatible; at least one must be sacrificed.
Given that many voters in Europe and the US feel battered by globalization, a populist party that aggressively puts the nation first has a head start against its rivals.
From this perspective, Macron was the ideal candidate for Le Pen to lose to.
He embodies the globalist elite.
He appears soft on immigration.
And, assuming that his new political party fails to win a majority in next month’s National Assembly election, his government will require support from the mainstream parties.
Over the next five years, establishment figures may well coalesce around failing policies, giving Le Pen the perfect target for the National Front’s 2022 presidential campaign.
To be sure, support for a leftist program certainly exists in France.
About 20% of voters backed the left-wing populist Jean-Luc Mélenchon in the presidential election’s first round. In the second round, one particularly illuminating Twitter hashtag was #NiPatronNiPatrie (“neither boss nor country”), reflecting many voters’ dissatisfaction with the election’s choice between neoliberalism and nationalism.
The task of the left is to direct attention to the truly problematic aspects of global economic integration – financialization, the prioritization of capital over labor, of creditor over debtor, of patron over ouvrier – without lapsing into reactionary politics.
D-Day Venezuela
CAMBRIDGE – The Venezuelan crisis is moving relentlessly from catastrophic to unimaginable.
The level of misery, human suffering, and destruction has reached a point where the international community must rethink how it can help.
Two years ago, I warned of a coming famine in Venezuela, akin to Ukraine’s 1932-1933 Holomodor.
On December 17, The New York Times published front-page photographs of this man-made disaster.
In July, I described the unprecedented nature of Venezuela’s economic calamity, documenting the collapse in output, incomes, and living and health standards.
Probably the single most telling statistic I cited was that the minimum wage (the wage earned by the median worker) measured in the cheapest available calorie, had declined from 52,854 calories per day in May 2012 to just 7,005 by May 2017 – not enough to feed a family of five.
Since then, conditions have deteriorated dramatically.
By last month, the minimum wage had fallen to just 2,740 calories a day.
And proteins are in even shorter supply.
Meat of any kind is so scarce that the market price of a kilogram is equivalent to more than a week of minimum-wage work.
Health conditions have worsened as well, owing to nutritional deficiencies and the government’s decision not to supply infant formula, standard vaccines against infectious diseases, medicines for AIDS, transplant, cancer, and dialysis patients, and general hospital supplies.
Since August 1, the price of a US dollar has added an extra zero, and inflation has exceeded 50% per month since September.
According to OPEC, oil production has declined by 16% since May, down more than 350,000 barrels a day.
To arrest the decline, President Nicolás Maduro’s government has had no better idea than to arrest some 60 senior managers of the state-owned oil company PDVSA and appoint a National Guard general with no industry experience to run it.
Rather than taking steps to end the humanitarian crisis, the government is using it to entrench its political control.
Rejecting offers of assistance, it is spending its resources on Chinese-made military-grade crowd-control systems to thwart public protests.
Many outside observers believe that as the economy worsens, the government will lose power.
But the organized political opposition is weaker now than it was in July, despite massive international diplomatic support.
Since then, the government has installed an unconstitutional Constituent Assembly with full powers, deregistered the three main opposition parties, sacked elected mayors and deputies, and stolen three elections.
With all solutions either impractical, deemed infeasible, or unacceptable, most Venezuelans are wishing for some deus ex machina to save them from this tragedy.
The best scenario would be free and fair elections to choose a new government.
This is Plan A for the Venezuelan opposition organized around the Mesa de la Unidad Democratica, and is being sought in talks taking place in the Dominican Republic.
But it defies credulity to think that a regime that is willing to starve millions to remain in power would yield that power in free elections.
In Eastern Europe in the 1940s, Stalinist regimes consolidated power despite losing elections.
The fact that the Maduro government has stolen three elections in 2017 alone and has blocked the electoral participation of the parties with which it is negotiating, again despite massive international attention, suggests that success is unlikely.
A domestic military coup to restore constitutional rule is less palatable to many democratic politicians, because they fear that the soldiers may not return to their barracks afterwards.
More important, Maduro’s regime already is a military dictatorship, with officers in charge of many government agencies.
The senior officers of the Armed Forces are corrupt to the core, having been involved for years in smuggling, currency and procurement crimes, narco-trafficking and extra-judicial killings that, in per capita terms are three times more prevalent than in Rodrigo Duterte’s Philippines.
Decent senior officers have been quitting in large numbers.
Targeted sanctions, managed by the US Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), are hurting many of the thugs ruling Venezuela.
But, measured in the tens of thousands of avoidable deaths and millions of additional Venezuelan refugees that will occur until the sanctions yield their intended effect, these measures are too slow at best.
At worst, they will never work.
After all, such sanctions have not led to regime change in Russia, North Korea, or Iran.
This leaves us with an international military intervention, a solution that scares most Latin American governments because of a history of aggressive actions against their sovereign interests, especially in Mexico and Central America.
But these may be the wrong historical analogies.
After all, Simón Bolívar gained the title of Liberator of Venezuela thanks to an 1814 invasion organized and financed by neighboring Nueva Granada (today’s Colombia).
France, Belgium, and the Netherlands could not free themselves of an oppressive regime between 1940 and 1944 without international military action.
The implication is clear.
As the Venezuelan situation becomes unimaginable, the solutions to be considered move closer to the inconceivable.
The duly elected National Assembly, where the opposition holds a two-thirds majority, has been unconstitutionally stripped of power by an unconstitutionally appointed Supreme Court.
And the military has used its power to suppress protests and force into exile many leaders including the Supreme Court justices elected by the National Assembly in July.
As solutions go, why not consider the following one: the National Assembly could impeach Maduro and the OFAC-sanctioned, narco-trafficking vice president, Tareck El Aissami, who has had more than $500 million in assets seized by the United States government.
The Assembly could constitutionally appoint a new government, which in turn could request military assistance from a coalition of the willing, including Latin American, North American, and European countries.
This force would free Venezuela, in the same way Canadians, Australians, Brits, and Americans liberated Europe in 1944-1945.
Closer to home, it would be akin to the US liberating Panama from the oppression of Manuel Noriega, ushering in democracy and the fastest economic growth in Latin America.
According to international law, none of this would require approval by the United Nations Security Council (which Russia and China might veto), because the military force would be invited by a legitimate government seeking support to uphold the country’s constitution.
The existence of such an option might even boost the prospects of the ongoing negotiations in the Dominican Republic.
An imploding Venezuela is not in most countries’ national interest.
And conditions there constitute a crime against humanity that must be stopped on moral grounds.
The failure of Operation Market Garden in September 1944, immortalized in the book and film A Bridge Too Far, led to famine in the Netherlands in the winter of 1944-1945.
Today’s Venezuelan famine is already worse.
How many lives must be shattered before salvation comes?
Stopping Venezuela’s Harvest of Sorrow
CARACAS – Two years ago, public protests erupted in both Kyiv and Caracas.
Whereas Ukraine’s Revolution of Dignity quickly took power, political change in Venezuela followed a much slower path.
But Venezuela’s parliamentary election on December 6, which gave the opposition a two-thirds majority, is moving political developments into the fast lane.
Although President Nicolás Maduro accepted defeat on election night, his government has promised to disregard any laws that the National Assembly enacts, and has appointed an alternative Assembly of the Communes not envisaged in the constitution.
Moreover, he used the National Assembly’s lame-duck session to pack the Supreme Court and has called on supporters to prevent the newly elected Assembly from being seated on January 5.
Like Ukraine two years ago, Venezuela is heading toward a constitutional crisis.
But there is an older and more ominous parallel between Venezuela and Ukraine: the Soviet Union’s man-made famine of 1933.
Stalin’s decision in 1932 to force independent farmers – the kulaks – into large collectivized farms caused 3.3 million Ukrainians and ethnic Poles to starve to death the following year.
The catastrophe was unleashed when Stalin, convinced that the kulaks were hiding grain from the Soviet state, requisitioned the seed grain, believing that this would force the kulaks to use the hidden grain as seed.
But there was no hidden grain – and thus no seed to plant the 1933 crop.
Stalin blamed the ensuing collapse in food production on conspiracies by the dead and dying.
Instead of dealing with the unfolding catastrophe, Stalin increased grain requisitions, despite dismal production levels – a move that led to mass starvation.
Information was hidden from the public, preventing remedial action.
Even offers of international humanitarian assistance, especially by Poland, were rejected.
A famine in a country as fertile as Ukraine was hard to imagine before it happened.
And it is hard to imagine a similar catastrophe in a country with the world’s largest oil reserves.
But, heading into 2016, Venezuela faces precisely such a scenario.
There are four fundamental ingredients of such man-made disasters: repression of the market, suppression of information, systematic persecution of dissent, and attribution of blame for the disaster to the victims (which justifies radicalizing the policies that led to the problem in the first place).
Sadly, Ukraine is not the only example: The human toll in China of Mao Zedong’s Great Leap Forward of 1958-1961 was even greater, causing an estimated 15-45 million deaths.
As in Ukraine and China, Venezuela’s government has been trying to collectivize production.
After Hugo Chávez was re-elected in 2006, he decided to accelerate the “revolution” and nationalized banks, telecoms, cement, steel, supermarkets, hundreds of other firms, and millions of hectares of land.
And, as in Ukraine and China, the affected firms’ output quickly collapsed.
Beyond outright expropriation, the government implemented a system that attacked the market’s natural ability to self-organize the economy.
The market is no panacea, and it can work only with a state that operates properly, but it is a powerful stabilizing force.
Market prices provide information about what is in short supply. Profits create incentives to respond to the information contained in prices.
And capital markets allocate resources in pursuit of profits.
Markets may fail, and policies can improve on outcomes; but Chávez and Maduro, like Stalin and Mao, attacked the market mechanism itself.
In Venezuela, a generalized system of price and foreign-exchange controls is causing havoc.
Foreign exchange is allocated administratively at a price that is about 130 times cheaper than the market rate.
Not even drug trafficking is as profitable as this arbitrage opportunity, with obvious consequences.
A formula for “just” prices keeps all prices artificially low (setting higher prices buys violators a ticket to prison), causing shortages, rationing, and queues that consume many hours of most Venezuelans’ days.
Shortages of critical items have already cost many lives, not to mention the devastating effects on production.
And, despite price controls, inflation is above 200%, because the central bank monetizes a fiscal deficit of more than 20% of GDP.
The rising oil prices that accompanied the adoption of these policies initially muted their impact, as imports could make up for the fall in output.
In 1998, when Chávez was first elected, oil was languishing at $8 per barrel; in 2012, prices averaged $104.
But, rather than using the windfall to build a financial cushion for a rainy day, Chávez chose to use high oil prices as collateral to borrow massively, quadrupling the public external debt.
This allowed him to spend in 2012 as if the price of oil were $197 per barrel.
But now, with Venezuelan crude below $30 dollars and the country cut off from international capital markets, imports are declining to a fraction of their 2012 level.
The previous destruction of productive capacity has come home to roost.
Without the market mechanism, the adjustment is taking place with too little information and too many perverse incentives, making its impact on production and welfare even more devastating.
The coming year will see a further drastic cut in imports.
Not only are oil prices even lower, but imports in 2014-2015 were financed in part by running down reserves and other assets, and by authorizing private imports but not paying for them, de facto expropriating the working capital – the seed grain – of private companies.
The implications of this madness are ominous.
To prevent a humanitarian catastrophe, swift action needs to be taken: restoration of the market mechanism; exchange-rate unification (as President Mauricio Macri just implemented in Argentina); an alternative system of social transfers to substitute for rationing; fiscal retrenchment; orderly foreign-debt restructuring; and massive financial support from the international community.
Maduro is not trying to do any of this; instead, he is devoting his energy and creativity to maintaining power, by fair means or foul.
But time is running out.
Unless Maduro changes, the new National Assembly – where the opposition’s two-thirds majority enables it to amend the constitution – will have to change him.
Preparing for the Unknown Unknowns
LONDON – We live in perilous times.
Just as we seem to get our bearings, something happens to make us feel as if our legs have been knocked out from under us.
Actions and events often are intertwined, and what happens on one level – affecting individuals, states, economic sectors, and companies of all sizes – may have repercussions on others.
The recent terrorist attacks in Paris are a case in point, affecting not only the families and friends of the victims, or even only the people of France.
The reverberations are being felt around the world, and they will continue to have an impact – far beyond Europe – on public policy, electoral politics, media freedom, and more.
The attacks came at a time when the world traditionally tries to make sense of the year ahead – to forecast the risks that lie in wait, the opportunities that will arise, and the challenges that will have to be overcome.
But what about longer-term risks?
Do events like the Paris attacks show that forecasting them is impossible?
Or did the attacks expose precisely the type of risk that long-term projections should identify?
The World Economic Forum has just released its “Global Risks 2015” report which attempts to predict and rank the biggest risks that the world faces over the next ten years.
The WEF’s focus is squarely on the macro level.
For example, “the biggest threat to the stability of the world in the next ten years comes from the risk of international conflict.”
And the menace of war is followed by a raft of social, environmental, geopolitical, technological, and economic risks and trends.
But all of these risks will be felt on an organizational, and ultimately, individual level as well.
That is why we spend time in conference rooms and around kitchen tables trying to identify and mitigate them.
And yet we also know that the pace of change is faster than ever before, and that governments, businesses, and households are finding it increasingly difficult to keep up.
Beneath all of our identifying, quantifying, and mitigating of risk lies the undeniable and timeless truth that the only constant is change.
For Heraclitus, change was the fundamental principle of life.
Machiavelli referred to it as fortuna:the events that shape us and determine our wellbeing are often beyond our reason and control.
Though we can attempt to plan for change, we cannot always predict the precise nature and time at which it will occur.
Moreover, for all the risks that we can and do plan for, it is those for which we cannot prepare that can do the most damage.
That is why, alongside all of the identifying, quantifying, and mitigating, we must also embrace the idea that not all change can be clearly foreseen and planned for.
The implication is that we must instill in our families, organizations, and states the resilience and tools needed to act effectively in times of crisis – and thus to minimize the potentially damaging impact of unexpected change.
This ethos will also help us maximize the potential benefits of such flux.
After all, without unforeseen change, much of human endeavor would be fruitless, and innovation would be unnecessary.
Shocking things like the massacre at Charlie Hebdo in Paris happen, and they seem to be happening more frequently than ever.
They turn our world upside down and make us question our sense of who we are.
It is at such moments that we demonstrate our ability – or lack of it – to confront the unexplained, the unplanned, and the unfathomable.
At the same time, such moments remind us that future generations ultimately will judge us not on the basis of what we accumulated – whether personally, as organizations, or as states – but by the impact we had on those around us, and by how well we responded to their needs.
In perilous times, when the emergence, timing, and diffusion of risks can have a paralyzing effect, what matters is not simply what we accomplish, but how we accomplish it.
In such times, the value we create cannot be measured only in terms of money.
More important is how much stronger, more capable, and more resilient we help our colleagues, partners, children, and fellow citizens become.
Perhaps the main risk this year – and in the decade ahead – is that we lose sight of this fundamental truth.
Like the Palestinians, the Kurds Deserve a State
JERUSALEM – Nowadays, almost everyone agrees that the Palestinian people deserve a state, and that they should not live under Israeli rule.
Most Israelis share this view, including even Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, who has reluctantly stated his own commitment to a two-state solution.
And in many Western democracies, a strong left-wing constituency regularly organizes demonstrations in favor of Palestinian independence.
The argument for Palestinian statehood is anchored in a fundamentally moral claim for national self-determination.
Yet when it comes to securing the same right for the Kurdish people, the West has been shamefully and strangely silent.
Western democracies offered no support for the Kurdistan Regional Government’s independence referendum in late September, and they have not spoken out against the Iraqi and Turkish governments’ threats to crush the KRG’s bid for statehood by force.
When officials in the European Union or the United States give a reason for opposing Kurdish independence, it always comes down to realpolitik.
Iraq’s territorial integrity must be preserved, we are told, and independence for the KRG could destabilize Turkey and Iran, owing to those countries’ sizeable Kurdish minorities.
But these arguments merely underscore a double standard.
Moral claims for self-determination are justly raised in the case of the Palestinians, but they are entirely absent from the international discourse about Kurdistan.
Worse still, the brutal oppression of the Kurds over many generations has been totally overlooked.
In Iraq under Saddam Hussein, the Kurds were subjected to genocidal chemical-weapons attacks.
And in Turkey, the military has razed hundreds of Kurdish villages.
Among the arguments used to deny the Kurds their right to self-determination, the defense of Iraq’s territorial integrity is the most spurious and hypocritical of all.
When British statesmen established Iraq as a distinct political entity after the defeat of the Ottoman Empire in World War I, they did so in accordance with their own imperialist interests. Accordingly, they disregarded the territory’s history, geography, demography, and ethnic and religious diversity.
The residents of this newly conjured state were never actually asked if they wanted to live in a country with an overwhelming Shia majority and large Kurdish and Christian minorities.
And they certainly were never asked if they wanted to be ruled by a Sunni dynasty that the British had implanted from the Hejaz, now a part of Saudi Arabia.
Initially, under the Treaty of Sèvres, which the defeated Ottoman Empire signed in August 1920, the Kurds, like the Armenians, were promised an independent state.
But the victorious Allied powers later abandoned this promise, and the Kurdish people have lived under constant oppression ever since.
In what became northern Iraq, the Kurds, like the country’s Assyrian Christians, were for decades denied recognition of their distinct language and culture by hegemonic Arab rulers in Baghdad.
In this context, “territorial integrity” is nothing more than an alibi for ethnic or religious oppression.
Similarly, the tens of millions of Kurds living in Turkey and Iran have also long been denied basic human and cultural rights.
It is thus understandable that the Turkish and Iranian governments would object to the KRG’s independence bid: they fear the emergence, if it succeeds, of similar movements among their own oppressed Kurdish populations.
But the prospect of an independent Palestine destabilizing Jordan is never offered as an argument against Palestinian statehood, and nor should such an argument be used against Iraq’s Kurds.
Moreover, the KRG has already established a relatively open and pluralistic society.
As a semi-autonomous region, Iraqi Kurdistan operates under a multi-party system the likes of which one will not find in neighboring Arab countries, let alone in Iran or Turkey, which is increasingly turning toward authoritarianism.
National self-determination is a universal right that should not be denied to populations suffering under oppressive non-democratic regimes.
The same arguments that rightly apply to the Palestinians should apply equally to the Kurds.
Human-rights activists who demonstrate for Palestinian statehood should be no less vocal on behalf of Kurdish statehood.
And human-rights claims – unless they are applied selectively as part of a hypocritical sham – should always trump realpolitik.
Throughout their long, tragic history, the Kurds have repeatedly been abandoned by the West, to its great shame.
This must not happen again.
Kurdish Peshmerga have been Western democracies’ staunchest allies in the fight against the Islamic State.
It would be a bitter travesty to abandon the Kurds to the mercy of the Iraqi or Turkish governments in their time of need.
What’s Holding Back the World Economy?
NEW YORK – Seven years after the global financial crisis erupted in 2008, the world economy continued to stumble in 2015.
According to the United Nations’ report World Economic Situation and Prospects 2016, the average growth rate in developed economies has declined by more than 54% since the crisis.
An estimated 44 million people are unemployed in developed countries, about 12 million more than in 2007, while inflation has reached its lowest level since the crisis.
More worryingly, advanced countries’ growth rates have also become more volatile.
This is surprising, because, as developed economies with fully open capital accounts, they should have benefited from the free flow of capital and international risk sharing – and thus experienced little macroeconomic volatility.
Furthermore, social transfers, including unemployment benefits, should have allowed households to stabilize their consumption.
But the dominant policies during the post-crisis period – fiscal retrenchment and quantitative easing (QE) by major central banks – have offered little support to stimulate household consumption, investment, and growth. On the contrary, they have tended to make matters worse.
In the US, quantitative easing did not boost consumption and investment partly because most of the additional liquidity returned to central banks’ coffers in the form of excess reserves.
The Financial Services Regulatory Relief Act of 2006, which authorized the Federal Reserve to pay interest on required and excess reserves, thus undermined the key objective of QE.
Indeed, with the US financial sector on the brink of collapse, the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 moved up the effective date for offering interest on reserves by three years, to October 1, 2008. As a result, excess reserves held at the Fed soared, from an average of $200 billion during 2000-2008 to $1.6 trillion during 2009-2015.
Financial institutions chose to keep their money with the Fed instead of lending to the real economy, earning nearly $30 billion – completely risk-free – during the last five years.
This amounts to a generous – and largely hidden – subsidy from the Fed to the financial sector.
And, as a consequence of the Fed’s interest-rate hike last month, the subsidy will increase by $13 billion this year.
Perverse incentives are only one reason that many of the hoped-for benefits of low interest rates did not materialize.
Given that QE managed to sustain near-zero interest rates for almost seven years, it should have encouraged governments in developed countries to borrow and invest in infrastructure, education, and social sectors. Increasing social transfers during the post-crisis period would have boosted aggregate demand and smoothed out consumption patterns.
Moreover, the UN report clearly shows that, throughout the developed world, private investment did not grow as one might have expected, given ultra-low interest rates.
In 17 of the 20 largest developed economies, investment growth remained lower during the post-2008 period than in the years prior to the crisis; five experienced a decline in investment during 2010-2015.
Globally, debt securities issued by non-financial corporations – which are supposed to undertake fixed investments – increased significantly during the same period.
Consistent with other evidence, this implies that many non-financial corporations borrowed, taking advantage of the low interest rates. But, rather than investing, they used the borrowed money to buy back their own equities or purchase other financial assets.
QE thus stimulated sharp increases in leverage, market capitalization, and financial-sector profitability.
But, again, none of this was of much help to the real economy.
Clearly, keeping interest rates at the near zero level does not necessarily lead to higher levels of credit or investment.
When banks are given the freedom to choose, they choose riskless profit or even financial speculation over lending that would support the broader objective of economic growth.
By contrast, when the World Bank or the International Monetary Fund lends cheap money to developing countries, it imposes conditions on what they can do with it.
To have the desired effect, QE should have been accompanied not only by official efforts to restore impaired lending channels (especially those directed at small- and medium-size enterprises), but also by specific lending targets for banks.
Instead of effectively encouraging banks not to lend, the Fed should have been penalizing banks for holding excess reserves.
While ultra-low interest rates yielded few benefits for developed countries, they imposed significant costs on developing and emerging-market economies.
An unintended, but not unexpected, consequence of monetary easing has been sharp increases in cross-border capital flows.
Total capital inflows to developing countries increased from about $20 billion in 2008 to over $600 billion in 2010.
At the time, many emerging markets had a hard time managing the sudden surge of capital flows. Very little of it went to fixed investment.
In fact, investment growth in developing countries slowed significantly during the post crisis period.
This year, developing countries, taken together, are expected to record their first net capital outflow – totaling $615 billion – since 2006.
Neither monetary policy nor the financial sector is doing what it’s supposed to do.
It appears that the flood of liquidity has disproportionately gone toward creating financial wealth and inflating asset bubbles, rather than strengthening the real economy.
Despite sharp declines in equity prices worldwide, market capitalization as a share of world GDP remains high.
The risk of another financial crisis cannot be ignored.
There are other policies that hold out the promise of restoring sustainable and inclusive growth.
These begin with rewriting the rules of the market economy to ensure greater equality, more long-term thinking, and reining in the financial market with effective regulation and appropriate incentive structures.
But large increases in public investment in infrastructure, education, and technology will also be needed.
These will have to be financed, at least in part, by the imposition of environmental taxes, including carbon taxes, and taxes on the monopoly and other rents that have become pervasive in the market economy – and contribute enormously to inequality and slow growth.
The views expressed here do not reflect the views of the United Nations or its member states.
Who Will Help the Poor?
PARIS – With the deepening of the economic crisis and the prospect of another recession looming large on the horizon, growing social inequality has become an increasingly urgent issue.
How does one reinforce a sense of solidarity and responsibility within a country?
Who will protect the weakest?
As I ponder this issue, I am reminded of a debate that I had more than ten years ago in Berlin with the German theologian Hans Küng and American and Asian participants.
The subject was “Globalization and Ethics” – specifically, a comparison of the ways that Europe, the United States and Asia protect the most fragile members of their respective societies.
All of the participants agreed that in Europe the state traditionally filled the role played by private philantropy in the US and by the family in Asia.
But we all hastened to add that no model was “pure,” i.e., the family was no longer what it used to be in Asia, the state was playing a bigger role than expected in America, and it was often underperforming in Europe.
Reality has become even more complicated since then: the family’s role continues to decline in Asia; philantropy, despite a few extraordinarily generous individuals, has more than met its limits in America; and, with the possible exception of the Nordic countries, the state in Europe, overburdened by debt, no longer has the means or the will to shoulder new responsibilities.
So who will take on the responsibility to protect the weakest if none of these three actors can do it properly?
Are we heading toward a world united by shared incompetence and inadequacy?
In the Western world, the poorest are the worst affected by economic stagnation.
But, in rapidly growing emerging-market countries, the rich tend to close their eyes to the suffering of the poorest, except when they feel threatened by the risk of political upheaval, as in, say, Saudi Arabia.
In fact, wealthy elites in emerging countries live in a state of denial towards their poor, literally ignoring them.
Brazil and India are particularly striking in this regard.
Economic growth is necessary, but not sufficient: a strong sense of social responsibility is needed as well.
It would be absurd to condemn, as some do, globalization as the main and only culprit in the erosion of traditional sources of support for the poor.
Globalization is above all a context, an environment, even if the consequences of the first major financial and economic crisis of the global age will further deepen the gap between the very rich and the very poor.
But globalization makes the weakest among us more visible, and therefore makes the absence of social justice more unacceptable.
A world of much greater transparency and interdependency creates new responsibilities for the rich.
Or, more precisely, it makes the old responsibility to protect the weakest both more difficult and more urgent.
In a world of increasing complexity, perhaps what is needed are simple solutions.
One could follow, for example, Adam Smith’s principle of comparative advantage: what Europe does best is the state, while Asia still relies on the family and the US continues to focus on individual initiative.
The problem is that in a world of universal benchmarking, the legitimacy of solutions will stem more than ever from their cultural acceptability and their efficiency.
In Western Europe, for example, the call for sacrifice from all citizens in order to resolve the debt crisis runs up against a lingering perception that not all will contribute equally, and that social inequality will be exacerbated by austerity.
Restoring growth in the short term while addressing debt problems in the medium and long term may well be the only valid response to the crisis.
But it will not work, in Europe or elsewhere, without a much greater emphasis on social justice.
While some of the very rich complain, as Warren Buffett did recently, that they do not pay enough taxes, the enlightened generosity of these happy few – who want to save capitalism and liberalism – is unlikely to be emulated by the new rich in the emerging countries, much less by the rich elsewhere.
Let’s be realistic: people like Buffett and Bill Gates have very few followers even among the very rich in the US.
And can Asian societies really revive an effective sense of family responsibility?
Globalization does appear to have weakened cultural differences noticeably in the past decade.
But, when it comes to the protection of the weakest and the struggle against rising social injustice, perhaps “global deculturation” creates an opportunity to combine the best of what remains in particular traditions.
Perhaps countries should seek to base their social-welfare systems on a new synthesis of the state, the family, and philanthropy.
Why Bannon Had to Go
WASHINGTON, DC – In many, if not most, US administrations, some figure emerges who convinces the press that the president couldn’t function without him (it’s yet to be a her).
The indispensable aide is, indeed, one of the most well-worn tropes of the modern presidency.
Karl Rove was “Bush’s Brain”; Harry Hopkins held Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s prolific White House team together; Bill Moyers appeared on a magazine cover as “Johnson’s Good Angel.”
Without such a figure, the story inevitably goes, the administration would be a mess, if not a disaster.
As often as not, the trope is invented or encouraged by the particular indispensable figure.
Journalists usually fall for the story, regardless of how well-founded it is: it clarifies everything, and it gives them something to write about.
The indispensable aide is only too happy to reveal some dramatic story about how he saved the day, devised some particularly ingenious idea, or prevented some terrible mistake.
But, as often as not, the soi-disant crucial figure oversteps.
In the Reagan White House, Don Regan, who succeeded James Baker as Chief of Staff, fancied himself the prime minister: he inserted himself into photos of Reagan with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, was rude to lesser beings (including reporters), and made the fatal mistake of hanging up on Nancy Reagan, who was dedicated to looking after her Ronny.
Regan was soon out.
Presidents themselves aren’t particularly fond of reading how some super-smart aide saved their bacon.
All presidents have healthy egos – if others are so smart, why aren’t they president?
The wise president-elect identifies a peacock and avoids the species from the start, or knows how to keep its feathers in check.
Barack Obama was plenty pleased with himself, with reason, but such was his dignity that no super-aide emerged during his presidency.
It didn’t occur to his advisers to try to outshine him.
Stephen Bannon wasn’t particularly wise as a White House aide – he couldn’t contain his inner peacock – and Donald Trump’s ego is particularly fragile.
Both are or were misfits in their roles.
Trump had spent his business life surrounded by family and flunkies: no stockholders or vice chairmen with their own ambitions.
The two men were a mismatch made in White House hell.
As a candidate, Trump went with his instincts, and his instinct in the 2016 presidential race was that blue-collar workers and others who feared for their economic future needed their own victims, be they Mexican immigrants or billionaire bankers.
A wall – phantasmagorical or not – would keep out the “bad people” Mexico was “sending us.”
As it happened, of all the people around Trump, Bannon most matched these views.
A person like Bannon – who presents himself as a learned figure and confirms one’s own brilliance – is a person one wants to have close by.
Trump is essentially a “whatever works” kind of guy.
Once elected, he brought in billionaires to populate his cabinet, and so far seems to have gotten away with telling his supporters that really rich people are needed to run the country.
Bannon, on the other hand, wrapped himself in what might be loosely termed a philosophy, which consisted of a nihilistic anger toward any “establishment.”
But his was faux populism: while Bannon politically championed blue-collar workers, he lived on the millions he had attained from a stint at Goldman Sachs and through a fortunate investment in the TV comedy series “Seinfeld.”
He also flourished with backing from the billionaire Mercer family.
The Mercers, who made their fortune through the high-tech genius of patriarch Robert Mercer and a hedge fund he led, fund Breitbart News, a far-right website formerly edited by Bannon that promotes ultra-nationalism and white supremacy, with a whiff of anti-Semitism.
Bannon’s ostensibly radical views were dressed up in a fancy set of principles embroidered with name-drops of far-out thinkers. In trade and immigration, for example, Bannon’s acquired philosophy aligned with Trump’s political opportunism (Trump’s more liberal, often Democrat-backing former self is another story).
It was a mistake to see Bannon as Pygmalion to Trump’s Galatea, or, as some did, as the Trump White House’s Rasputin.
Bannon reinforced the nationalist inclination that led Trump to overrule his daughter Ivanka and his economic advisers by withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement.
And Bannon intruded on foreign policy by getting himself put on the National Security Council for a while, until two of the generals in Trump’s administration – National Security Adviser H. R. McMaster and John Kelly (now the chief of staff) – got him removed.
(Bannon was believed to be behind the recent push to force out McMaster, mainly by suggesting that he is “anti-Israel.”)
But Bannon’s role as genius-without-portfolio – in which Trump indulged him, until Kelly arrived and clarified chains of command – was his undoing.
Without any defined responsibilities, he intruded where he wished – and ended up with a lot of enemies.
He had plenty of time to fight internal battles by feeding reporters stories about his White House rivals, though he would switch someone (for example, former Chief of Staff Reince Priebus) from rival to friend, as convenient.
Bannon was a troublemaker as much as a policymaker – and the two roles didn’t mesh.
Trump also began to see Bannon as a “leaker.”
And Trump’s White House is all too leaky: many who work there let reporters know that they have, at best, mixed feelings about working for Trump, but believe the better part of valor is to stay and protect the country from his leadership.
Bannon’s braggadocio took him to the most dangerous terrain on which to confront Trump: the president’s obsession with his election victory.
The ambiguity of winning the Electoral College vote (not, as he has falsely claimed, by the greatest margin since Reagan) but losing the popular vote by nearly three million votes, dogs Trump.
That’s why he invented millions of “illegal” voters and had maps printed showing the states he won in red – covering most of the territory of the United States – even suggesting to at least one reporter that his newspaper run the map on the paper’s front page.
Suggestions by Bannon that he played a major role in Trump’s election victory were poisonous to the relationship between the two men.
And so this White House misfit finally had to go.
Now that Bannon is gone, however, he will hurl missives from his new-old perch at Breitbart, to which he returned the same day as his announced departure.
And Trump will still be Trump.
The Truth About Sovereignty
CAMBRIDGE – In the French parliament’s recent debate on Europe’s new fiscal treaty, the country’s Socialist government vehemently denied that ratification of the treaty would undermine French sovereignty.
It places “not one constraint on the level of public spending,” Jean-Marc Ayrault, the prime minister, asserted.
“Budget sovereignty remains in the parliament of the French Republic.”
As Ayrault was trying to reassure his skeptical colleagues, including many members of his own party, European Commissioner for Competition Joaquin Almunia was delivering a similar message to his fellow social democrats in Brussels.
To succeed, he argued, Europe must prove wrong those who believe there is a conflict between globalization and sovereignty.
Nobody likes to give up national sovereignty, least of all, it seems, politicians on the left.
Yet, by denying the obvious fact that the eurozone’s viability depends on substantial restraints on sovereignty, Europe’s leaders are misleading their voters, delaying the Europeanization of democratic politics, and raising the political and economic costs of the ultimate reckoning.
The eurozone aspires to full economic integration, which entails the elimination of transaction costs that impede cross-border commerce and finance.
Obviously, it requires that governments renounce direct restrictions on trade and capital flows.
But it also requires that they harmonize their domestic rules and regulations – such as product-safety standards and bank regulations – with those of other member states in order to ensure they do not act as indirect trade barriers.
And governments must forswear changes in these policies, lest the uncertainty itself act as a transaction cost.
This was all implicit in the European Union’s single-market initiative.
The eurozone went one step further, aiming through monetary unification to eradicate fully the transaction costs associated with national currencies and exchange-rate risk.
Simply put, the European integration project has hinged on restrictions on national sovereignty.
If its future is now in doubt, it is because sovereignty stands in the way once again.
In a true economic union, underpinned by union-wide political institutions, the financial problems of Greece, Spain, and the others would not have blown up to their current proportions, threatening the existence of the union itself.
Consider the United States.
No one even keeps track of, say, Florida’s current-account deficit with the rest of the country, although we can safely guess that it is huge (since the state is home to many retirees living off benefits that come from elsewhere).
When Florida’s state government goes bankrupt, Florida’s banks continue to operate normally, because they are under federal rather than state jurisdiction.
When Florida’s banks go belly-up, state finances are insulated, because the banks are ultimately the responsibility of federal institutions.
When Florida’s workers become unemployed, they get unemployment checks from Washington, DC.
And when Florida’s voters are disenchanted about the economy, they do not riot outside the state capital; they put pressure on their representatives in Congress to push for changes in federal policies.
Nobody would argue that US states have an abundance of sovereignty.
The relationship between sovereignty and democracy is also misunderstood.
Not all restrictions on the exercise of sovereign power are undemocratic.
Political scientists talk about “democratic delegation” – the idea that a sovereign might want to tie its hands (through international commitments or delegation to autonomous agencies) in order to achieve better outcomes.
The delegation of monetary policy to an independent central bank is the archetypal example: in the service of price stability, daily management of monetary policy is insulated from politics.
Even if selective limitations on sovereignty may enhance democratic performance, there is no guarantee that all limitations implied by market integration would do so.
In domestic politics, delegation is carefully calibrated and restricted to a few areas where the issues tend to be highly technical and partisan differences are not large.
A truly democracy-enhancing globalization would respect these boundaries.
It would impose only those limits that are consistent with democratic delegation, possibly along with a limited number of procedural norms (such as transparency, accountability, representativeness, use of scientific evidence, etc.) that enhance democratic deliberation at home.
As the American example illustrates, it is possible to give up on sovereignty – as Florida, Texas, California, and the other US states have done – without giving up on democracy.
But combining market integration with democracy requires the creation of supranational political institutions that are representative and accountable.
The conflict between democracy and globalization becomes acute when globalization restricts the domestic articulation of policy preferences without a compensating expansion of democratic space at the regional/global level.
Europe is already on the wrong side of this boundary, as the political unrest in Spain and Greece indicates.
That is where my political trilemma begins to bite: We cannot have globalization, democracy, and national sovereignty simultaneously.
We must choose two among the three.
If European leaders want to maintain democracy, they must make a choice between political union and economic disintegration.
They must either explicitly renounce economic sovereignty or actively put it to use for the benefit of their citizens.
The first would entail coming clean with their own electorates and building democratic space above the level of the nation-state.
The second would mean giving up on monetary union in order to be able to deploy national monetary and fiscal policies in the service of longer-term recovery.
The longer this choice is postponed, the greater the economic and political cost that ultimately will have to be paid.
How Economics Survived the Economic Crisis
LONDON – The tenth anniversary of the start of the Great Recession was the occasion for an elegant essay by the Nobel laureate economist Paul Krugman, who noted how little the debate about the causes and consequences of the crisis have changed over the last decade.
Whereas the Great Depression of the 1930s produced Keynesian economics, and the stagflation of the 1970s produced Milton Friedman’s monetarism, the Great Recession has produced no similar intellectual shift.
This is deeply depressing to young students of economics, who hoped for a suitably challenging response from the profession.
Why has there been none?
Krugman’s answer is typically ingenious: the old macroeconomics was, as the saying goes, “good enough for government work.” It prevented another Great Depression.
So students should lock up their dreams and learn their lessons.
A decade ago, two schools of macroeconomists contended for primacy: the New Classical – or the “freshwater” – School, descended from Milton Friedman and Robert Lucas and headquartered at the University of Chicago, and the New Keynesian, or “saltwater,” School, descended from John Maynard Keynes, and based at MIT and Harvard.
Freshwater-types believed that budgets deficits were always bad, whereas the saltwater camp believed that deficits were beneficial in a slump.
Krugman is a New Keynesian, and his essay was intended to show that the Great Recession vindicated standard New Keynesian models.
But there are serious problems with Krugman’s narrative.
For starters, there is his answer to Queen Elizabeth II’s now-famous question: “Why did no one see it coming?”
Krugman’s cheerful response is that the New Keynesians were looking the other way.
Theirs was a failure not of theory, but of “data collection.” They had “overlooked” crucial institutional changes in the financial system.
While this was regrettable, it raised no “deep conceptual issue” – that is, it didn’t demand that they reconsider their theory.
Faced with the crisis itself, the New Keynesians had risen to the challenge.
They dusted off their old sticky-price models from the 1950s and 1960s, which told them three things. First, very large budget deficits would not drive up near-zero interest rates.
Second, even large increases in the monetary base would not lead to high inflation, or even to corresponding increases in broader monetary aggregates.
And, third, there would be a positive national income multiplier, almost surely greater than one, from changes in government spending and taxation.
These propositions made the case for budget deficits in the aftermath of the collapse of 2008.
Policies based on them were implemented and worked “remarkably well.”
The success of New Keynesian policy had the ironic effect of allowing “the more inflexible members of our profession [the New Classicals from Chicago] to ignore events in a way they couldn’t in past episodes.” So neither school – sect might be the better word – was challenged to re-think first principles.
This clever history of pre- and post-crash economics leaves key questions unanswered.
First, if New Keynesian economics was “good enough,” why didn’t New Keynesian economists urge precautions against the collapse of 2007-2008?
After all, they did not rule out the possibility of such a collapse a priori.
Krugman admits to a gap in “evidence collection.” But the choice of evidence is theory-driven.
In my view, New Keynesian economists turned a blind eye to instabilities building up in the banking system, because their models told them that financial institutions could accurately price risk.
So there was a “deep conceptual issue” involved in New Keynesian analysis: its failure to explain how banks might come to “underprice risk worldwide,” as Alan Greenspan put it.
Second, Krugman fails to explain why the Keynesian policies vindicated in 2008-2009 were so rapidly reversed and replaced by fiscal austerity.
Why didn’t policymakers stick to their stodgy fixed-price models until they had done their work?
Why abandon them in 2009, when Western economies were still 4-5% below their pre-crash levels?
The answer I would give is that when Keynes was briefly exhumed for six months in 2008-2009, it was for political, not intellectual, reasons.
Because the New Keynesian models did not offer a sufficient basis for maintaining Keynesian policies once the economic emergency had been overcome, they were quickly abandoned.
Krugman comes close to acknowledging this: New Keynesians, he writes, “start with rational behavior and market equilibrium as a baseline, and try to get economic dysfunction by tweaking that baseline at the edges.”
Such tweaks enable New Keynesian models to generate temporary real effects from nominal shocks, and thus justify quite radical intervention in times of emergency.
But no tweaks can create a strong enough case to justify sustained interventionist policy.
The problem for New Keynesian macroeconomists is that they fail to acknowledge radical uncertainty in their models, leaving them without any theory of what to do in good times in order to avoid the bad times.
Their focus on nominal wage and price rigidities implies that if these factors were absent, equilibrium would readily be achieved.
They regard the financial sector as neutral, not as fundamental (capitalism’s “ephor,” as Joseph Schumpeter put it).
Without acknowledgement of uncertainty, saltwater economics is bound to collapse into its freshwater counterpart.
New Keynesian “tweaking” will create limited political space for intervention, but not nearly enough to do a proper job.
So Krugman’s argument, while provocative, is certainly not conclusive.
Macroeconomics still needs to come up with a big new idea.
Four Ways to Beat HIV/AIDS
PITTSBURGH – In the fight against HIV/AIDS, some stories illuminate the long road to global eradication more than others.
In 2009, I heard one such story in Tanzania.
I was visiting a remote village when I spoke to a woman who knew that she was HIV-positive.
She told me that the established health guidelines at the time indicated that she could not receive treatment until her count of CD4 T-helper cells, a type of white blood cell used by the immune system, had dropped below a certain threshold.
After walking several miles to get her count checked, she arrived at the clinic only to find its testing machine broken.
The machine was still inoperative the second time she made the long journey.
Only months later, after her third trip to the clinic on foot, did she receive her cell count: her levels were far below the necessary threshold.
Her treatment should have begun months before.
Since HIV/AIDS was first identified in 1984, it has killed more than 35 million people.
Although the number of AIDS-related deaths has fallen by almost half since peaking in 2005, there are still far too many people dying from this preventable condition.
In 2016 alone, one million people around the world died from HIV-related causes, while 1.8 million more became infected.
Contrary to popular myth, we have not turned the corner on AIDS – not by a long shot.
World AIDS Day, on December 1, is an occasion to honor the millions of victims, and to recommit to ending this devastating disease.
According to UNAIDS, just 54% of HIV-positive adults, and only 43% of HIV-positive children, are currently receiving the antiretroviral therapies that save lives and prevent new infections.
With so many untreated patients, the virus will continue to spread.
As CEO of a global pharmaceutical company, I’m proud of the work we have done to fight HIV/AIDS around the world.
Today, more than eight million people – nearly half of all patients receiving treatment for HIV in developing countries – depend on the antiretroviral treatments that we produce.
But for those of us on the front lines of this struggle, our work is far from over.
The pharmaceutical industry has a responsibility to expand access to testing and treatment, and to help stop the spread of HIV once and for all.
Fulfilling four key commitments will make this goal achievable.
For starters, pharmaceutical companies should do more to increase the availability of low-cost, generic medicines.
My company, Mylan, introduced the first generic once-daily pill for developing countries in 2009, and we have continually reduced its price to make it more accessible to more people.
With this treatment alone, Mylan and other generic manufacturers save the US government, international donors, and national health programs more than $4.5 billion a year.
Still, treatment options could be expanded further.
In September, Mylan announced a collaboration with UNAIDS, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the Clinton Health Access Initiative, and other partners to provide the next-generation single-pill HIV regimen to patients in more than 90 low- and middle-income countries for less than $75 per year.
These drugs are widely used in high-income countries because they produce fewer side effects.
Affordability initiatives like this one should be replicated.
Next, drug makers must continue investing in capacity and supply-chain reliability.
Since 2005, the number of people on antiretroviral therapies worldwide has grown by a factor of ten, to 21 million.
But roughly twice as many people are currently infected with HIV.
Over the last decade, Mylan has invested more than $250 million in expanding production capacity, and we now produce four billion tablets and capsules each year.
But further investments are needed if we are to provide access to the other 21 million people still not on treatment.
A third urgently needed commitment is to increase support for research that accelerates the development of new innovations in effective and efficient treatment delivery.
For example, Mylan provides study medications to research trials, like the MaxART trial in Swaziland, which demonstrated that providing treatment to all HIV-positive people is the best way to slow the disease’s spread.
We also supported the Kirby Institute’s ENCORE1 trial, to develop a reduced-dose version of the most commonly used HIV treatment regimen.
And we are currently working with the US Agency for International Development as part of a partnership called OPTIMIZE, which aims to accelerate access to new therapies.
We do not support trials like these because we hope to gain any marketable intellectual property – we won’t.
Rather, we support them because it is the right way to advance science and improve treatment.
Finally, real gains in the fight against HIV/AIDS will require drug makers to account for the limitations of health-care systems and distribution networks in the developing countries they serve.
Antiretroviral therapies for children are a good example of these challenges.
Drugs for young people produced in the West are often liquids that require refrigeration.
But developing countries often have limited cold-storage capacities or an inability to transport liquid in bulk.
That’s why Mylan has developed heat-stable, taste-masked, dispersible tablets that can easily be incorporated into food.
Our scientists are now working on the next-generation formula, which comes in the equivalent of a sugar packet that even newborns can take.
More innovations like these will be needed to solve the country-specific issues that patients face.
The global health community has made remarkable progress in turning the tide on HIV/AIDS, introducing new products and advocating for earlier treatment.
But when I think back to the woman I met in Tanzania, I am reminded of how much work remains to be done.
Makers of generic medicines have an important role to play in this fight, and we will not stop working until treatment is available to every patient in the world who needs it.
The Risk of a New Economic Non-Order
LONDON – Next month, when finance ministers and central bank governors from more than 180 countries gather in Washington, DC, for the annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, they will confront a global economic order under increasing strain.
Having failed to deliver the inclusive economic prosperity of which it is capable, that order is subject to growing doubts – and mounting challenges.
Barring a course correction, the risks that today’s order will yield to a world economic non-order will only intensify.
The current international economic order, spearheaded by the United States and its allies in the wake of World War II, is underpinned by multilateral institutions, including the IMF and the World Bank.
These institutions were designed to crystallize member countries’ obligations, and they embodied a set of best economic-policy practices that evolved into what became known as the “Washington Consensus.”
That consensus was rooted in an economic paradigm that aimed to promote win-win interactions among countries, emphasizing trade liberalization, relatively unrestricted cross-border capital flows, free-market pricing, and domestic deregulation.
All of this stood in stark contrast to what developed behind the Iron Curtain and in China over the first half of the postwar period.
For several decades, the Western-led international order functioned well, helping to deliver prosperity and relative financial stability.
Then it was shaken by a series of financial shocks that culminated in the 2008 global financial crisis, which triggered cascading economic failures that pushed the world to the edge of a devastating multi-year depression.
It was the most severe economic breakdown since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
But the crisis did not appear out of nowhere to challenge a healthy economic order.
On the contrary, the evolution of the global order had long been outpaced by structural economic changes on the ground, with multilateral governance institutions taking too long to recognize fully the significance of financial-sector developments and their impact on the real economy, or to make adequate room for emerging economies.
For example, governance structures, including voting power, correspond better to the economic realities of yesterday than to those of today and tomorrow.
And nationality, rather than merit, still is the dominant guide for the appointment of these institutions’ leaders, with top positions still reserved for European and US citizens.
The destabilizing consequences of this obstinate failure to reform sufficiently multilateral governance have been compounded by China’s own struggle to reconcile its domestic priorities with its global economic responsibilities as the world’s second-largest economy.
Several other countries, particularly among the advanced economies, have also failed to transform their domestic policies to account for changes to economic relationships resulting from globalization, liberalization, and deregulation.
As a result of all of this, the balance of winners and losers has become increasingly extreme and more difficult to manage, not just economically, but also politically and socially.
With too many people feeling marginalized, forgotten, and dispossessed – and angry at the leaders and institutions that have allowed this to happen – domestic policy pressure has intensified, causing countries to turn inward.
This tendency is reflected in recent challenges to several features of the economic order, such as the North American Free-Trade Agreement, as well as America’s withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the United Kingdom’s renunciation of European Union membership.
All are casting a shadow on the future of the global economic system.
America’s inward turn, already underway for several years, has been particularly consequential, because it leaves the world order without a main conductor.
With no other country or group of countries anywhere close to being in a position to carry the baton, the emergence of what the political scientist Ian Bremmer has called a “G-Zero era” becomes a lot more probable.
China is responding to the global system’s weakening core by accelerating its efforts to build small networks, including around the traditional Western-dominated power structures.
This has included the establishment of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, the proliferation of bilateral payments agreements, and the pursuit of the “Belt and Road Initiative” to build infrastructure linking China with western Asia, Europe, and Africa.
These dynamics are stoking trade tensions and raising the risk of economic fragmentation.
If this trend continues, the global economic and financial configuration will become increasingly unstable, amplifying geopolitical and security threats at a time when better cross-border coordination is vital to address threats from non-state actors and disruptive regimes, such as North Korea.
Over time, the risks associated with this shift toward a global economic non-order could have severe adverse effects on geopolitics and national security.
None of this is new.
Yet, year after year, top government officials at the IMF/World Bank annual meetings fail to address it.
This year is likely to be no different.
Instead of discussing concrete steps to slow and reverse the march toward a global economic non-order, officials will probably welcome the cyclical uptick in global growth and urge member countries to do more to remove structural impediments to faster, more durable, and more inclusive growth.
While understandable, that isn’t good enough.
The upcoming meetings offer a critical opportunity to start a serious discussion of how to arrest the lose-lose dynamics that have been gaining traction in the global economy.
The longer it takes for the seeds of reform to be sown, the less likely they will be to take root – and the higher the probability that a lose-lose world economic non-order will emerge.
The World Economy in 2018
STANFORD – All major macroeconomic indicators – growth, unemployment, and inflation – suggest that 2017 will be the American economy’s best year in a decade.
And the global economy is enjoying broad, synchronized growth beyond what anyone expected.
The question now is whether this strong performance will continue in 2018.
The answer, of course, will depend on monetary, fiscal, trade, and related policies in the United States and around the world.
And yet it is hard to predict what policy proposals will emerge in 2018.
There are relatively new heads of state in the US, France, and the United Kingdom; German leaders still have not formed a governing coalition since the general election in September; and the US Federal Reserve has a new chair awaiting confirmation.
Moreover, major changes in important developing economies such as Argentina, Saudi Arabia, and Brazil have made the future outlook even murkier.
Still, we should hope for the best.
First and foremost, we should hope that synchronized global growth at a rate of just under 4% will continue in 2018, as the International Monetary Fund projected in October.
Growth not only raises incomes, but also makes vexing problems such as bad bank loans and budget deficits more manageable.
As former US President John F. Kennedy famously said in an October 1963 speech in which he promoted his proposed corporate and personal tax reductions, “a rising tide lifts all boats.”
For my part, I predict that the global recovery will continue, but at a slightly slower growth rate of around 3.5%.
The two most obvious risks to keep an eye on will be Europe, where a cyclical upturn could stall, and the oil-rich Middle East, where tensions could flare up once again.
Second, let us hope that the Fed, guided by the steady hand of its new chair, Jerome “Jay” Powell, will continue or even accelerate its monetary-policy normalization, both by raising its benchmark federal funds rate, and by shrinking its engorged balance sheet.
And we should hope that economic conditions allow the other major central banks, especially the European Central Bank, to follow suit.
On this front, I predict that the major central banks will continue to normalize monetary policies more gradually than is necessary.
The biggest risk here is that markets may try to test the Fed under its new leadership, for example, if inflation rises faster than anticipated.
Third, let us hope that the Republican tax package will, if enacted, deliver on its promise of increased investment, output, productivity, and wages over the coming decade.
Here, I predict that the legislation will pass, and that investment in the US over the next few years will be relatively higher than if no action had been taken.
To be sure, whether investment will rise from its currently subdued level will depend on many other factors than the corporate-tax rate.
But the tax package can still be expected to boost output, productivity, and wages.
The question is not if, but when.
If the full effects of the legislation are not felt before the 2018 or 2020 elections, that lag could prove politically consequential.
The biggest danger is that its benefits will be delayed, and that its key provisions will be reversed whenever the Democrats are back in power.
Fourth, let us hope that governments everywhere begin to address the looming crisis in public-pension and health-care costs, which have been rising for decades.
As social programs become costlier, they crowd out government expenditures on necessities such as defense, while generating ever more pressure to impose higher growth-suppressing taxes.
Europe, in particular, must not let its cyclical rebound lull it into complacency.
Many European Union member states still need to reduce their government debt, and the eurozone needs to resolve its “zombie bank” crisis.
Beyond that, structural labor-market reforms of the kind French President Emmanuel Macron is pursuing would be most welcome.
Unfortunately, I’m afraid that progress on structural reforms will be sporadic, at best.
The danger is that slow growth will not lead to sufficient wage gains and job creation to defuse the ticking time bomb of high youth unemployment in many countries.
Another risk is that reform attempts could provoke a political backlash that would be harmful to long-term investment.
Fifth, let us hope that the eurozone can avoid a currency crisis.
This will depend largely on whether German Chancellor Angela Merkel can form a coalition government and restore political stability to Europe’s largest economy.
Sixth, we should hope that the EU and the UK can agree on a reasonable Brexit deal that will preserve fairly strong trade relations.
The main risk here is that localized declines in trade could spill over and cause broader harm.
And, beyond Europe, let us hope that negotiations between the US, Canada, and Mexico over the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) will result in an arrangement that still facilitates continental trade.
For trade generally, the biggest risk is that the Trump administration could start a lose-lose trade dispute, owing to its understandable eagerness to help American manufacturing workers.
Seventh, let us hope that new policies targeting information and communication technology (ICT) strike the right balance among all stakeholders’ competing and legitimate concerns.
On one hand, there is reason to worry about certain Internet companies’ concentration of market power, particularly in online content and distribution, and about the effects of new technologies on personal privacy, law enforcement, and national security.
On the other hand, new technological advances could deliver immense economic gains.
It is easy to envision a scenario of too much regulation, or of too little.
It is also easy to envision a large-scale public backlash against the major technology companies, particularly if poor self-policing or a refusal to cooperate with law enforcement leads to some horrible event.
Here, I predict that achieving an appropriate policy balance will take years.
If some future event strikes an emotional chord, the public’s mood could swing dramatically.
Ultimately, however, I suspect that competition and innovation will survive the forthcoming regulations.
Finally, and most important, let us hope that terrorism is thwarted everywhere, conflicts subside, democracy and capitalism regain some momentum, and greater civility and honest dialogue return to the public domain.
Should that happen in 2018, it will be a very good year indeed.
A Roadmap to End Cholera
GENEVA – “Where is your toilet?”
This is often the first question I ask when I visit the site of a cholera outbreak anywhere in the world.
More often than not, the answer is: “We don’t have one.
We go wherever we can.”
Cholera, an ancient disease, has become a disease of poverty.
It does not discriminate geographically, but it preys mostly on vulnerable communities in areas with poor sanitation.
Carried by contaminated floodwaters to sources of drinking water, transported by unsuspecting travelers, or brought into homes on produce irrigated with untreated sewage, the Vibrio cholerae bacterium settles in the small intestine after it is ingested, causing severe diarrhea and dehydration.
Those who are fortunate enough never to have witnessed cholera’s effects firsthand might assume that it is just another stomach bug.
But without swift medical attention, cholera can sap the life out of an adult or child in a matter of hours.
Each year, cholera claims the lives of an estimated 95,000 people; many who die are children.
This year, images of listless, glassy-eyed cholera victims awaiting treatment have emerged in countries worldwide.
The disease has spread at an unprecedented rate in Yemen, where more than 2,000 people have died since April.
Cholera outbreaks are ongoing in Somalia, South Sudan, Haiti, and other countries across sub-Saharan Africa and Asia.
But the saddest fact about cholera’s recent toll on human lives is that every single death was preventable.
The world already has the knowledge and tools to control cholera effectively, but existing resources are not being aligned with the necessary global commitments.
That is why the new global strategy developed by the Global Task Force on Cholera Control, a diverse network of technical partners, is so vital.
Ending Cholera – A Global Roadmap to 2030 emphasizes a shift to proactive approaches, and aims to reduce cholera deaths by 90% over the next decade.
With full implementation, the plan could also help as many as 20 countries eliminate disease transmission in the same timeframe.
Based on three pillars – early detection, integrated prevention tactics, and coordination between countries and partners – the roadmap provides a concrete path for ending cholera as a public health threat.
Once cholera grips a community, it becomes increasingly difficult to control.
It is important, therefore, that the disease is not forgotten even when it is not claiming victims.
A multi-sector approach that includes investments in water, sanitation, and hygiene – so-called WASH services – can keep cholera at bay.
So can the proactive use of oral cholera vaccines and quick access to treatments, such as oral rehydration solution and intravenous fluids.
Improving WASH infrastructure is the most effective path to prevention, though implementing these services will take time in countries with fewer resources.
For this reason, the roadmap also encourages the preemptive and large-scale deployment of oral vaccines in cholera hotspots.
The vaccines work immediately, and can prevent cholera for up to three years, serving as a bridge to the implementation of longer-term solutions.
Oral cholera vaccines are available via a global stockpile maintained by the World Health Organization, with support from Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance.
More than 15 million doses have been distributed to 18 countries since the program’s creation in 2013.
Next year, the stockpile is set to increase to more than 25 million doses, up from two million when it began.
Ending cholera as a health threat by 2030, as global partners and the WHO recently pledged, will require sustained collaboration and commitment from cholera-affected countries, technical partners, and international donors.
The goal may seem daunting, given that millions of people around the world are at risk of contracting the disease each year.
But with urbanization, climate change, and other factors likely to increase the threat of infection, it is a goal that must be met.
The roadmap makes this possible.
Implementing the plan will prove to be a cost-effective solution for countries saddled with responding to frequent cholera outbreaks.
That is one reason why action is urgently needed.
But embracing the strategy is also the right thing to do for the international community.
Governments have a moral obligation to ensure that no one succumbs to a preventable death.
It is an obligation the WHO shares, and it is why we will work hard to help the world meet the ambitious targets we have set.
We have the tools needed to beat cholera.
Now, with a plan in place, there can no longer be any excuse not to put them to use.
Whither the Multilateral Trading System?
BRUSSELS – Free trade seems to have few supporters these days.
Though actual trade volumes are recovering from the post-crisis recession and drop in commodity prices, “globalization” has become increasingly contentious, as exemplified by the election of US President Donald Trump on the back of a promise to rip up international agreements and get tough on trade partners.
What does this mean for the future of the rules-based trading system?
Some 60 years ago, when the current rules-based global trading system was conceived, the United States was the world’s sole economic “hyperpower,” possessing unquestioned dominance in the day’s most advanced manufacturing industries.
With enough power to impose rules, and enough dominance to be able to count on accruing the largest share of the benefits, it could – and did – perform the role of “benevolent hegemon.”
As Japan and Europe recovered from World War II – with the latter getting an added boost from economic integration – America’s lead began to dwindle, and by the 1970s and 1980s, the US was sharing power over the world’s trade agenda with Europe.
Nonetheless, because the US and Europe share so many common interests, they generally adhered to a cooperative approach.
It was not until imports began to overwhelm a growing number of industries in the US, fueling the emergence of large and persistent external deficits, that the country’s trade policy became more defensive, creating friction with many of its partners.
Yet, even then, US leaders understood the value of the liberal multilateral trading system, and supported the establishment, in 1995, of the World Trade Organization as the successor to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
The WTO’s creation amounted to a major step forward, as it addressed not just tariffs, but also other trade barriers, including indirect barriers arising from domestic regulations.
Given the complexity of assessing how domestic regulations might impede trade, especially compared to judging whether a tariff has been correctly applied, the WTO needed effective dispute-settlement mechanisms, with members agreeing to binding arbitration.
The system worked, because its major members recognized the legitimacy of independent panels, even if they sometimes deliver politically inconvenient judgments.
Yet this recognition is now increasingly in doubt.
Consider what type of economy would support a rules-based system.
After WWII, the US supported such a system, because of its unassailable economic supremacy.
An open rules-based system would also be highly appealing in a world comprising only small countries, none of which could hope to gain by relying on its relative economic power.
Things become more complicated when the global economy includes a small number of economies of similar size, larger than the small economies from the previous example, but not large enough to dominate the system alone.
That is the scenario the Nobel laureate economist Paul Krugman considered in a 1989 paper on bilateralism, in which he reported that a world consisting of three major trading blocs constitutes the worst constellation for trade, as a lack of explicit cooperation among all three would lead to increasing trade barriers.
Unfortunately, this is exactly the situation in which the global economy finds itself today.
There are three dominant economies or trading blocs – China, the European Union, and the US – with very similar trade volumes (exports plus imports) of around $4 trillion each. (Japan, which was a strong contender 25 years ago, now has a much smaller trade volume.)
Together, the G3 economies account for 40% of world trade and 45% of global GDP.
With economic power distributed in this way, explicit cooperation by all three actors is crucial.
Yet there are compelling reasons why they would be reticent to pursue such cooperation.
Even if Trump weren’t president, the current global trading system would present problems for the US, whose trade policy has long focused on manufactured goods. (Trade in raw materials has always been relatively free, and trade in agricultural goods has usually been considered special, and thus not subject to rules like the “most favored nation” principle, which applies to manufactures.)
Because the US is now self-sufficient in energy, it needs to export fewer manufactured goods than industrialized countries with no domestic energy resources.
Annual US exports of manufactured goods thus now amount to only about $1 trillion annually – significantly less than both the EU and China, which export almost twice as much in manufactured goods, despite having somewhat smaller economies.
To be sure, Trump is unlikely to start an outright trade war, because any US tariff would harm the interests of the country’s largest companies, which have invested huge sums in production facilities abroad.
Yet no individual firm will be willing to give up much of its political capital to defend the rules-based system, either, because it would have to bear the losses, while its competitors shared the gains.
The same goes for the G3 trading blocs: if the EU expends political capital to stop the US from undermining WTO mechanisms, China (and the rest of world) will reap most of the gains.
That dynamic goes some way toward explaining why China’s leaders, despite having proclaimed their support for the multilateral rules-based trading system, haven’t taken concrete action to reinforce it.
Their reticence is probably intensified by the assumption that, within the current generation, their country will dominate the global economy; at that point, they might no longer want to be bound by somebody else’s rules.
It does not help matters that the Communist Party of China has recently been empowered even further in all areas of the economy, with all major firms now having to accept a CPC representative on their board.
It is difficult to see how a dominant economic power governed by a single party – especially one with such extensive control over the economy – would accept the primacy of international rules and procedures over domestic considerations.
The conclusion is clear. The world should prepare itself for the erosion of the rules-based trading system enshrined in the WTO.
Ready or Not for the Next Recession?
COPENHAGEN – A sunny day is the best time to check whether the roof is watertight.
For economic policymakers, the proverbial sunny day has arrived: with experts forecasting strong growth, now is the best time to check whether we are prepared for the next recession.
The answer, for the United States in particular, is a resounding no.
Policymakers normally respond to recessions by cutting interest rates, reducing taxes, and boosting transfers to the unemployed and other casualties of the downturn.
But the US is singularly ill-prepared, for a combination of economic and political reasons, to respond normally.
Most obviously, the US Federal Reserve’s target for the federal funds rate is still only 1.25%-1.5%.
If no recession is imminent, the Fed may succeed in raising rates three times by the end of the year, to around 2%.
But that would still leave little room for monetary easing in response to recessionary trends before the policy rate hits zero again.
In the last three recessions, the Fed’s cumulative interest-rate cuts have been close to five full percentage points.
This time, because slow recovery has permitted only gradual normalization of interest rates, and because there appears to have been a tendency for interest rates to trend downward more generally, the Fed lacks room to react.
In principle, the Fed could launch another round of quantitative easing.
In addition, at least one of US President Donald Trump’s nominees to the Federal Reserve Board has mooted the idea of negative interest rates.
That said, this Fed board, with its three Trump appointees, is likely to be less activist and innovative than its predecessor.
And criticism by the US Congress of any further expansion of the Fed’s balance sheet would be certain and intense.
Fiscal policy is the obvious alternative, but Congress has cut taxes at the worst possible time, leaving no room for stimulus when it is needed.
Adding $1.5 trillion more to the federal debt will create an understandable reluctance to respond to a downturn with further tax cuts.
As my Berkeley colleagues Christina and David Romer have shown, fiscal policy is less effective in countering recessions, and less likely to be used, when a country has already incurred a high public debt.
Instead of stimulating the economy in the next downturn, the Republicans in Congress are likely to respond perversely.
As revenues fall and the deficit widens even faster, they will insist on spending cuts to return the debt trajectory to its previous path.
Congressional Republicans will most likely start with the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which provides food to low-income households.
SNAP is already in their sights.
They will then proceed to cut Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security.
The burden of these spending cuts will fall on hand-to-mouth consumers, who will reduce their own spending dollar for dollar, denting aggregate demand.
For their part, state governments, forced by new limits on the deductibility of state and local taxes to pare their budgets, are likely to move further in the direction of limiting the duration of unemployment benefits and the extent of their own food and nutrition assistance.
Nor will global conditions favor the US.
Foreign central banks, from Europe to Japan, have similarly scant room to cut interest rates. Even after a government in Germany is finally formed, policymakers there will continue to display their characteristic reluctance to use fiscal policy.
And if Germany doesn’t use its fiscal space, there will be little room for its eurozone partners to do so.
More than that, scope for the kind of international cooperation that helped to halt the 2008-2009 contraction has been destroyed by Trump’s “America First” agenda, which paints one-time allies as enemies.
Other countries will work with the US government to counter the next recession only if they trust its judgment and intentions.
And trust in the US may be the quantity in shortest supply.
In 2008-2009, the Fed extended dollar swap lines to foreign central banks, but came under congressional fire for “giving away” Americans’ hard-earned money.
Then, at the London G20 summit in early 2009, President Barack Obama’s administration made a commitment to coordinate its fiscal stimulus with that of other governments.
Today, almost a decade later, it is hard to imagine the Trump administration even showing up at an analogous meeting.
The length of an economic expansion is not a reliable predictor of when the next downturn will come.
And the depth and shape of that recession will depend on the event triggering it, which is similarly uncertain.
The one thing we know for sure, though, is that expansions don’t last forever.
A storm will surely come, and when it does, we will be poorly prepared for the deluge.
An Opportunity for the WTO
ONTARIO – This December, trade ministers from around the world will converge in Buenos Aires for the World Trade Organization’s 11th Ministerial Conference.
With the United States, which has historically led the world toward trade liberalization, now actively stoking trade tensions, the meeting is set to be unlike any other.
The WTO’s ministerial gatherings are never easy.
Some kind of agreement is usually delivered, but only at the last minute, and its language is often vague.
This time, however, the outcome might be even more disappointing, with delegates unable to reach even a symbolic agreement that they can tout with an aggressive marketing campaign.
The current tensions over free trade, rooted in the uneven distribution of its benefits, cannot be resolved within the WTO, let alone by a ministerial gathering.
But that doesn’t mean that the upcoming conference must be for naught.
On the contrary, it should serve as a critical opportunity to initiate the update and recalibration that the WTO needs to remain an effective platform for international trade cooperation and consensus-building.
One key problem that must be addressed relates to “special and differential treatment” (S&D).
About two thirds of the WTO’s 164 members have declared themselves developing countries – a label that entitles them to S&D provisions, including the authority to maintain trade tariffs for a longer period of time.
With the WTO lacking any benchmarks or indicators to determine when a country should be weaned off S&D, it is no surprise that no developing country has ever “developed.”
To be sure, since S&D was first introduced in 1979, many developing countries have grown richer. But they have shown no indication that they are ready to relinquish the benefits of S&D, even for industries that have become internationally competitive.
It is hard to argue that all developing countries should enjoy the indefinite privilege of opting out of the WTO’s general obligations for all sectors of their economies.
And with so many of their WTO partners claiming preferential status, developed-country members often resist trade concessions within the organization, preferring to conduct negotiations in other forums.
The dynamic in the WTO stands in stark contrast to that within the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
At the WTO, developed countries would like to see big emerging markets take on more obligations, while developing countries resist.
At the Bretton Woods institutions, developed countries are blocking emerging economies from gaining greater influence.
But the two dynamics have something in common: intransigence, even if coming from different quarters, reflects a denial of reality.
In the Bretton Woods institutions, the emerging economies are right that their increased economic weight should correlate with larger capital contributions and more weight in decision-making.
In the WTO, S&D clearly needs to be updated to ensure that it benefits only countries that actually need it.
Ministers at the conference in Buenos Aires should thus be prepared to have an honest discussion about S&D.
A second topic that the WTO needs to address relates to consensus-building.
Under current WTO rules, most decisions can be adopted by a majority vote.
But the long-standing practice has been to adopt all decisions by consensus.
This is wise and should not change.
Though consensus-building can be slow and cumbersome, it is the only way to generate the legitimacy that WTO decisions need.
A simple majority vote, after all, would fail to account for differences in market size.
And weighted voting would undermine the WTO’s capacity to settle disputes by adjudicating rights and obligations among members of different size and political heft.
The problem is that consensus is interpreted as an unlimited veto power, such that a member can block any discussion on matters of interest to others.
A consensus-based approach can work only if it entails an obligation by all members to work toward shared interests, with members objecting formally only to decisions running counter to some fundamental interest.
The Paris climate agreement was made possible by a simple method called “Indaba,” adopted from the Zulu and Xhosa people of South Africa. Negotiators had the right to withhold consent, but only if they put forth alternate proposals aimed at finding common ground.
If Indaba worked in Paris, it could also work at the WTO.
In Buenos Aires, ministers should discuss how to ensure that WTO members responsibly exercise their right to block decisions.
The final issue that ministers should be prepared to discuss in Buenos Aires is the need to ensure that the WTO adapts effectively to a changing international environment.
The problems with both S&D and consensus decision-making at the WTO are not new, but they have long been ignored, allowing them to deepen.
This would not have happened if incremental reform was ingrained in the WTO’s regular activities.
Both the IMF and the World Bank have policy watchdogs that regularly scrutinize and evaluate their functioning.
Running on very small budgets, these ruthless truth-tellers regularly force their institutions’ leaders to have honest discussions about organizational effectiveness and possible reforms.
Such an independent office for evaluation is precisely what the WTO needs.
The WTO cannot sweep its problems under the carpet forever.
The question is whether it will undertake the reforms it needs now or wait until a costly crisis leaves it no choice.
China’s Contradictions
NEW HAVEN – China’s quinquennial Communist Party congresses are that rare event where ritual and dogma combine with introspection and strategy. The 19th National Congress, which began on October 18, is no exception.
Notwithstanding the suspense over potential changes in Party leadership, which typically occur at the end of the meeting, President Xi Jinping’s political report, delivered on the opening day, was a high-impact event.
Significantly, it says as much about the Party as it does about Xi.
As Alice Miller, a leading Sinologist at Stanford’s Hoover Institution, emphasizes, the report was carefully crafted over a one-year period to convey the consensus of the Party’s highest organ, the 205-member Central Committee.
Three conclusions from Xi’s address are particularly important.
For starters, the ideological underpinnings of “Xi Jinping Thought” have been raised to the same lofty level as those of “Mao Zedong Thought,” effectively elevating Xi over his three predecessors – Hu Jintao, Jiang Zemin, and even the revered Deng Xiaoping.
Much has been written about Xi’s consolidation of power since he was appointed General Secretary in November 2012. But this elevation makes it official.
After only five years in office, the Party leadership has anointed Xi as one of modern China’s two greatest historic figures.
Second, the political report speaks with great confidence about a China that has now entered a “New Era.” But by underscoring the Chinese adage that the “…last leg of a journey just marks the halfway point,” Xi sketched an even more ambitious future.
China’s sights are now set on two goals – completing the task of building the so-called moderately prosperous society by 2035, and then establishing its position as a Great Power by 2050.
Unlike China’s goal-setting exercises in the past, there are no quantitative targets attached to these “twin centenary goals” (which roughly align with the Party’s founding in 1921 and the establishment of the People’s Republic of China in 1949). They celebrate the long-awaited national rejuvenation that Xi has dubbed the China Dream.
The third point is perhaps the most intriguing.
This is couched in the form of China’s “principal contradiction” – a Marxist concept that serves as an admission of a fundamental problem requiring resolution.
The principal contradiction, while typically elliptical and ambiguous, frames a rich discussion of risks and opportunities, strategy and tactics, reforms and governance – all of which will shape China’s prospects for the foreseeable future.
The big news is that, under Xi’s leadership, the Party has revised its principal contradiction for the first time since 1981. Whereas the contradiction had previously been framed as a tradeoff between the needs of the people and China’s “backward social production,” it is now viewed as a tension between “unbalanced and inadequate development” and the “people’s ever-growing needs for a better life.”
This restatement of the principal contradiction has not emerged from thin air.
It clearly signals a far-reaching change in national perspective – from that of a poor developing country to that of an increasingly prosperous society focused on becoming a Great Power.
It is also consistent with the critique of former Premier Wen Jiabao, who in March 2007 famously warned of a Chinese economy that was becoming increasingly “unstable, unbalanced, uncoordinated, and [ultimately] unsustainable.”
Over the past ten years, two five-year plans – the 12th, enacted in 2011, and the 13th, enacted in 2016 – plus a major set of reforms adopted at the so-called Third Plenum in 2013, have aimed to resolve China’s persistent and worrisome imbalances.
Xi’s political report doesn’t alter the main thrust of those efforts.
The real significance is that rebalancing is now enshrined within the Party’s ideological underpinnings. It is a foundational pillar of Xi Jinping Thought.
The political report’s focus on China’s principal contradiction also raises important questions about what still may be missing from the Party’s long-term strategy.
Three “secondary contradictions” are especially striking on the economic front.
First, there is ongoing tension between the role of the state and that of markets in guiding resource allocation.
This was a glaring contradiction of the 2013 Third Plenum reforms, which focused on the seemingly inconsistent combination of a “decisive role” for markets and steadfast support for state ownership.
The Party has long believed that these two features of economic life are compatible – the so-called blended economy with Chinese characteristics.
Xi’s political report praises the mixed ownership model and also aspires to an economy led by great firms with unmatched global competitive prowess. But it glosses over the thorny issue of state-owned enterprise reform that may be required to resolve this contradiction and avoid the Japanese “zombie” problem of a chronic debt overhang.
Second, there is the tension between supply and demand.
Consistent with other recent pronouncements of senior Chinese officials, the political report leaves little doubt that supply-side structural reforms are now the highest priority of economic policymakers.
The related emphasis on productivity, innovation, pruning excess capacity, and moving up the value chain in manufacturing and services are underscored as key building blocks of this effort.
At the same time, the report de-emphasizes consumer spending and services – now buried deep in the list of priorities for a modernized economy.
Yet focusing on supply without paying equal attention to the foundations of aggregate demand is a puzzling and potentially worrisome disconnect.
A final secondary tension can be found in the contrast between the path and the destination.
Notwithstanding all the self-congratulatory flourishes in Xi’s political report, there is good reason to believe that the Chinese economy is only in the early stages of its long-heralded structural transformation.
Its services sector is growing rapidly, but is still embryonic, accounting for just 52% of GDP.
And household consumption, which is also growing rapidly, is still less than 40% of GDP.
China may well be on a path to a New Normal or a New Era.
But the final destination remains far down the road, with many contradictions to be resolved during the journey.
The GDP-Wellbeing Gap
KUALA LUMPUR – The link between economic growth and human wellbeing seems obvious.
Indeed, as measured by gross domestic product, economic growth is widely viewed as the ultimate development objective.
But it is time to rethink this approach.
In fact, there is a rising disconnect between countries’ per capita GDP and their citizens’ wellbeing, as rapid output growth exacerbates health challenges and erodes environmental conditions.
Given this, people increasingly value non-material wealth just as highly as monetary wealth, if not more.
But persuading policymakers and politicians of GDP’s limitations is no easy feat.
After all, it is far simpler to defend a well-understood, long-accepted framework than it is to champion a new worldview.
To be sure, GDP provides valuable information about a country’s production, expenditure, and income streams, as well as the flow of goods across borders.
Moreover, it has provided crucial guidance to countries, helping them to track economic gains that have improved citizens’ quality of life considerably – in many cases lifting them out of destitution.
But GDP fails to account for changes in a country’s stock of assets, making it difficult for policymakers to balance economic, social, and environmental concerns.
Without better measures of wellbeing – including health, education, and the state of the natural environment – policymakers cannot gain the insights that they need to ensure the long-term health of the economy and the individuals who comprise it.
This imperative underpins the concept of “sustainable development,” which has gradually gained acceptance since its introduction in the mid-1980’s.
But, even as countries have recognized the need for a more comprehensive understanding of development, they have largely retained GDP growth as their central objective.
This has to change.
Even US-based Nobel laureate Simon Kuznets, the depression-era father of GDP, said in 1934 that, “the welfare of a nation can scarcely be inferred from a measure of national income.”
The good news is that a robust, simple, and effective framework for measuring sustainability already exists.
Developed by a group of leading economists, including the Nobel laureate Kenneth Arrow and Partha Dasgupta of the University of Cambridge, it assesses an economy’s income flows in the context of its stocks of assets, including human and natural capital.
In other words, it accounts for the economy’s productive base, rather than just its monetary wealth.
Based on this framework, United Nations University and the UN Environment Program unveiled the Inclusive Wealth Report (IWR) at the 2012 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro.
By providing a long-term comparison between GDP and “inclusive wealth” for 20 countries, the report aimed to motivate policymakers to take a more comprehensive, longer-term view of their economies’ development.
This November, a second IWR will be released, with many more countries represented and a stronger focus on human capital in national-account indicators.
To this end, collaborating experts will convene in Malaysia this month for a series of meetings, culminating in a public symposium entitled “Beyond Gross Domestic Product – Transitioning into Sustainability.”
Transforming the world’s understanding of economic development requires a dynamic approach.
Experts in various fields – including economics, sociology, psychology, and the natural sciences – must work together to develop an integrated suite of indicators that provides a comprehensive picture of humanity’s productive base, on which people’s ability to pursue their interpretation of success depends.
While final decisions should rest with policymakers and citizens, the process must be guided by the best available science, uncompromised by political demands or vested interests.
Moreover, one fundamental truth must be recognized: the planet cannot accommodate high-income status for all seven billion of its inhabitants.
For every country to attain per capita GDP of $13,000 (which, according to the World Bank, delineates high-income status), global GDP would need to rise from roughly $72 trillion today to $91 trillion.
If, however, we already use the equivalent of 1.5 earths to provide the resources we consume and to absorb our waste, the planet can sustainably support a GDP of only $48-50 trillion.
And if the planet already exceeds its sustainable carrying capacity, we should be reducing our demands on it – not adding new ones.
Simply put, we can no longer depend on GDP growth, and the limitless wealth accumulation that it implies, to solve our social and economic problems.
The world must align its value systems with this reality.
We must learn to do more with less, decouple economic growth from resource consumption, and nurture the social and spiritual aspects of our existence.
This shift will be impossible without fundamental changes to our education systems, political structures, and institutions.
It is a tall order, but our future depends on fulfilling it.
The Injustices of Zika
SOUTHAMPTON – Outbreaks of communicable diseases in the developing world are bad enough from a health perspective.
But they also have serious implications for social justice, because they exacerbate longstanding human-rights crises, including by undermining already-weak public-services provision and deepening existing inequalities.
Like the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa, the Zika outbreak in Central and South America in 2015 hit vulnerable social groups – women and children, ethnic minorities, and the poor – the hardest.
Like yellow fever, dengue, and other diseases, Zika is transmitted by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes.
But, unusually for a mosquito-borne virus, Zika can also be transmitted sexually.
Even more unusual, it is associated with neurological and developmental conditions affecting babies: microcephaly and Guillain-Barré syndrome.
Otherwise, its symptoms are often rather mild.
This means that, of the more than 1.5 million people stricken by Zika since the outbreak, the consequences were most worrying for women of child-bearing age, especially those who were already pregnant.
Between 2016 and 2017, a total of 11,059 Zika cases in pregnant women were confirmed, producing 10,867 cases of microcephaly and other congenital malformations of their babies’ central nervous systems.
Fifty-six percent of those babies were born to poor women and women of color from northeast Brazil.
Clearly,the Zika crisis is not gender-neutral.
In addressing its medium- to long-term consequences, a focus on women – especially poor women – is needed.
That does not mean more media coverage of the deformities associated with microcephaly or even of the difficulties faced by their mothers.
And it certainly does not mean more efforts to police women’s behavior.
To avoid infection, women have been advised to use mosquito repellent; remove standing water around their homes; wear long sleeves; and, if possible, use condoms or avoid sex.
The US Center for Disease Control and Prevention advised pregnant women to refrain from traveling to affected countries.
Most extreme, health officials in El Salvador and Colombia urged women not to get pregnant until 2018.
Such recommendations, however well intended they may be, are fundamentally flawed.
For starters, they emphasize short-term-vector control and surveillance, while delinking the disease from the social and structural determinants of health, including public infrastructure such as running water, proper sanitation, and access to care.
They also place the responsibility for avoiding disease and pregnancy primarily on women, while failing to recognize the lack of control many women have over their bodies and pregnancies.
Many of the areas affected by Zika have high rates of sexual violence and teen pregnancy, a lack of sex education, and inadequate access to contraceptives.
For these reasons, more than 50% of pregnancies in Latin America are unintended.
Making matters worse, in most Latin American countries affected by Zika, abortion is illegal, or permitted only in exceptional situations.
For example, in El Salvador, where more than 7,000 cases of Zika were reported between December 2015 and January 2016, abortions are illegal under all circumstances.
Miscarriages, if proven to be self-induced, can even lead to homicide convictions.
The position of the United States hasn’t helped, either.
Last year, US President Barack Obama’s administration asked Congress for $1.8 billion in emergency funding to help prepare for and respond to the Zika threat.
But abortion politics intervened, as Republican lawmakers, leading a congressional hearing on the Zika outbreak, made the funding conditional on anti-abortion policies in recipient countries.
The problems with the dominant approach to containing the Zika virus – namely, that it saddles women with too much responsibility while giving them too little power – are not lost on everyone.
Last year, the United Nations Refugee Agency and the World Health Organization emphasized the need to put human rights at the center of the response to the Zika outbreak.
But, while high-level recognition of women’s sexual and reproductive rights is a positive step, it is far from sufficient.
And doing what is needed to protect those rights, particularly among poor and vulnerable women in developing countries, will require deep and sustained political commitment.
In particular, national legislation must be revised to ensure that all women – whether they are carrying a baby with microcephaly or not – have full reproductive autonomy.
Women must be able to base their reproductive choices on their own physical and emotional needs and desires, not on the moral judgments of powerful agents or risk of criminal sanctions.
Advocacy groups in Brazil, for example, are already pushing for such an outcome, submitting legal cases to the Supreme Court to secure greater reproductive rights for women, including the right to safe and legal abortion.
Those cases tend to lean on the 1988 National Constitution, which guarantees the right to abortion in case of rape, danger to the mother’s life, or anencephaly, another birth defect involving the brain.
In pursuing these changes, campaigns should also recognize and address the links between women’s and disability rights.
Indeed, they should advance equality for all marginalized groups.
Zika’s medium- and long-term consequences must be addressed with this in mind.
When a woman gives birth to a child with a congenital syndrome deriving from the Zika virus, the response should be grounded in the dignity, value, and rights of each individual.
It should acknowledge the processes that keep certain individuals and groups in poverty and that deny them the basic rights of citizens.
That is why campaigners must insist that the state be responsible for providing appropriate care and support services for each woman and child – services that both meet their needs and respect their rights.
